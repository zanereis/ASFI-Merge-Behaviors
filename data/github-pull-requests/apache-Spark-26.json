changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980, #31267, #35357, #36889, #38209, #39755, #41120, #42684, #44315 and #45883.\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` to the number of executor threads when users specify the master as `local[...]`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe static number of `200` is a bit unreasonable, and sometimes it makes small jobs very slow. With this change, the new comers can leverage performance improvement in their laptop.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. If users use `master` as `local[...]`, then `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` will be set the number of executor threads.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in my PySpark shell, and checked it in UI.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-15T05:10:38Z","updated_at":"2024-10-26T00:23:38Z","closed_at":"2024-10-26T00:23:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35c2f36846565da680bb28126717e8a0893fd899","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a retry of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47328 which replaces RDD to Dataset to write SparkR metadata plus this PR removes `repartition(1)`. We actually don't need this when the input is single row as it creates only single partition:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e5e751b98f9ef5b8640079c07a9a342ef471d75d/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/LocalTableScanExec.scala#L49-L57 \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to leverage Catalyst optimizer and SQL engine. For example, now we leverage UTF-8 encoding instead of plain JDK ser/de for strings. We have made similar changes in the past, e.g., https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29063, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15813, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17255 and SPARK-19918.\r\n\r\nAlso, we remove `repartition(1)`. To avoid unnecessary shuffle.\r\n\r\nWith `repartition(1)`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition, REPARTITION_BY_NUM, [plan_id=6]\r\n   +- LocalTableScan [_1#0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout `repartition(1)`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nLocalTableScan [_1#2]\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should verify the change\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThere are some special informations needed for structured streaming queries. Specifically, each query has a query_id and run_id. Also if using MicrobatchExecution (default), there is a batch_id.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA (query_id, run_id, batch_id) identifies the microbatch the streaming query runs. Adding these field to a threadContext would help especially when there are multiple queries running. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.kubernetes.executor.checkAllContainers` by default from Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.1.0, `spark.kubernetes.executor.checkAllContainers` is supported and useful because [sidecar pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/) is used in many cases. Also, it prevents user mistakes which forget and ignore the sidecars' failures by always reporting sidecar failures via executor status.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29924\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- This configuration is no-op when there is no other container.\r\n- This will report user containers' error correctly when there exist other containers which are provided by the users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBoth `true` and `false` are covered by our CI test coverage since Apache Spark 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

PR is based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42911.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Enables Scala and Java Unidoc generation for the `connectClient` project.\r\n- Generates docs and moves them to the `docs/api/connect` folder.\r\n\r\nSome methods' documentation in the connect directory had to be modified to remove references to avoid javadoc generation failures. **References API docs in the main index page and the global floating header will be added in a later PR.**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIncreasing scope of documentation for the Spark Connect JVM/Scala Client project.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently we are supporting GROUP BY <column>, where column is of MapType, but we don't support scenarios where column type contains MapType nested in some complex type (i.e. ARRAY<MAP<INT,INT>>), this PR addresses this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are extending support for MapType columns in GROUP BY clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nCustomer would be able to use MapType nested in complex type as part of GROUP BY clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

strings\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn #35110, it was incorrectly asserted that:\r\n\r\n> ApacheCommonBase64 obeys http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt\r\n\r\nThis is not true as the previous code called:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static byte[] encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich states:\r\n\r\n> Encodes binary data using the base64 algorithm but does not chunk the output.\r\n\r\nHowever, the RFC 2045 (MIME) base64 encoder does chunk by default. This now means that any Spark encoded base64 strings cannot be decoded by encoders that do not implement RFC 2045. The docs state RFC 4648.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

not optional.\r\n**Proposed Changes**\r\nThis pull request proposes updating the documentation to reflect that the values parameter in the .melt() method is required and not optional, as previously indicated. The documentation will now specify that values can be a str, Column, tuple, or list and must be explicitly provided.\r\n\r\n**Justification for Changes**\r\nThe change is necessary because the current documentation incorrectly states that the values parameter is optional. This has led to confusion and runtime errors, as the parameter is actually required for the function to execute properly.\r\n\r\n**User-Facing Changes**\r\nThis change affects the documentation only. It corrects the description of the values parameter from optional to required, providing clarity to users. This change will ensure users are aware that they need to specify the values parameter when using the .melt() method.\r\n\r\n**Testing of Changes**\r\nNo new tests are required for this documentation update, as it does not affect the code's functionality. This update aims to clarify existing functionality and prevent user errors.\r\n\r\n**Use of Generative AI**\r\nNo

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt uses `UnsafeRow` to represent struct result in the JSON parser. It saves memory compared to the current `GenericInternalRow`. The change is guarded by a flag and disabled by default.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark shows that enabling the flag brings ~10% slowdown. This is basically expected because converting to `UnsafeRow` requires some work. The purpose of the PR is to provide an alternative to save memory.\r\n\r\nI did the following experiment. It generates a big `.gz` JSON file containing a single large array. Each array element is a struct with 50 string fields and will be parsed into a row by the JSON reader.\r\n\r\n```\r\ns = b'{\"field00\":null,\"field01\":\"field01_<v>\",\"field02\":\"field02_<v>\",\"field03\":\"field03_<v>\",\"field04\":\"field04_<v>\",\"field05\":\"field05_<v>\",\"field06\":\"field06_<v>\",\"field07\":\"field07_<v>\",\"field08\":\"field08_<v>\",\"field09\":\"field09_<v>\",\"field10\":null,\"field11\":\"field11_<v>\",\"field12\":\"field12_<v>\",\"field13\":\"field13_<v>\",\"field14\":\"field14_<v>\",\"field15\":\"field15_<v>\",\"field16\":\"field16_<v>\",\"field17\":\"field17_<v>\",\"field18\":\"field18_<v>\",\"field19\":\"field19_<v>\",\"field20\":null,\"field21\":\"field21_<v>\",\"field22\":\"field22_<v>\",\"field23\":\"field23_<v>\",\"field24\":\"field24_<v>\",\"field25\":\"field25_<v>\",\"field26\":\"field26_<v>\",\"field27\":\"field27_<v>\",\"field28\":\"field28_<v>\",\"field29\":\"field29_<v>\",\"field30\":null,\"field31\":\"field31_<v>\",\"field32\":\"field32_<v>\",\"field33\":\"field33_<v>\",\"field34\":\"field34_<v>\",\"field35\":\"field35_<v>\",\"field36\":\"field36_<v>\",\"field37\":\"field37_<v>\",\"field38\":\"field38_<v>\",\"field39\":\"field39_<v>\",\"field40\":null,\"field41\":\"field41_<v>\",\"field42\":\"field42_<v>\",\"field43\":\"field43_<v>\",\"field44\":\"field44_<v>\",\"field45\":\"field45_<v>\",\"field46\":\"field46_<v>\",\"field47\":\"field47_<v>\",\"field48\":\"field48_<v>\",\"field49\":\"field49_<v>\"}'\r\n\r\nimport gzip\r\n\r\ndef write(n):\r\n  with gzip.open(f'json{n}.gz', 'w') as f:\r\n    f.write(b'[')\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if i != 0:\r\n            f.write(b',')\r\n        f.write(s.replace(b'<v>', str(i).encode('ascii')))\r\n    f.write(b']')\r\n\r\nwrite(100000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it processes the file in Spark shell with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.driver.memory=1g --conf spark.executor.memory=1g  --master \"local[1]\"\r\n\r\n> val schema = \"field00 string, field01 string, field02 string, field03 string, field04 string, field05 string, field06 string, field07 string, field08 string, field09 string, field10 string, field11 string, field12 string, field13 string, field14 string, field15 string, field16 string, field17 string, field18 string, field19 string, field20 string, field21 string, field22 string, field23 string, field24 string, field25 string, field26 string, field27 string, field28 string, field29 string, field30 string, field31 string, field32 string, field33 string, field34 string, field35 string, field36 string, field37 string, field38 string, field39 string, field40 string, field41 string, field42 string, field43 string, field44 string, field45 string, field46 string, field47 string, field48 string, field49 string\"\r\n> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.json.useUnsafeRow\", \"false\")\r\n> spark.read.schema(schema).option(\"multiline\", \"true\").json(\"json100000.gz\").selectExpr(\"sum(hash(struct(*)))\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the flag is off (the current behavior), the query can process 2.5e5 rows but fails to process 3e5 rows. When the flag is on, the query can process 8e5 rows but fails to process 9e5 rows. We can say this change reduces the memory consumption to about 1/3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt reduces the memory requirement of JSON-related query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new JSON unit test with the config flag on.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReduces the overhead of `inspect.stack` in `_capture_call_site` by inlining `inspect.stack` with using `generator` instead of `list`.\r\nAlso, specify `context=0` for `inspect.getframeinfo` to avoid unnecessary field retrievals.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `_capture_call_site` has inevitable overhead when `Column` operations happen a lot, but it can be reduced.\r\n\r\nE.g.,\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom functools import reduce\r\n\r\ndef alias_schema():\r\n    return df.select(reduce(lambda x, y: x.alias(f\"col_a_{y}\"), range(20), F.col(\"a\"))).schema\r\nprofile(alias_schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1106\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 15 24 31\"

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR added a trait that logical plans can extend to implement a method to decide whether there can be non-deterministic expressions for the operator, and check this method in checkAnalysis. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI encountered the `INVALID_NON_DETERMINISTIC_EXPRESSIONS` exception when attempting to use a non-deterministic udf in my query. The non-deterministic expression can be safely allowed for my custom LogicalPlan, but it is disabled in the checkAnalysis phase. The CheckAnalysis rule is too strict so that reasonable use cases of non-deterministic expressions are also disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe test case `\"SPARK-48871: AllowsNonDeterministicExpression allow lists non-deterministic expressions\"` is added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

up #45408\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[[SPARK-47307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47307)] Add a config to optionally chunk base64 strings\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn #35110, it was incorrectly asserted that:\r\n\r\n> ApacheCommonBase64 obeys http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt\r\n\r\nThis is not true as the previous code called:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static byte[] encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich states:\r\n\r\n> Encodes binary data using the base64 algorithm but does not chunk the output.\r\n\r\nHowever, the RFC 2045 (MIME) base64 encoder does chunk by default. This now means that any Spark encoded base64 strings cannot be decoded by encoders that do not implement RFC 2045. The docs state RFC 4648.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a `try_url_decode` function that performs the same operation as `url_decode`, but returns a NULL value instead of raising an error if the decoding cannot be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn hive we usually do url decoding like: `reflect('java.net.URLDecoder', 'decode', 'test%1')`, and return a `NULL` value instead of raising an error if the decoding cannot be performed.\r\n\r\nAlthough spark provides a `try_reflect` function to do this, but as commented in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34023#issuecomment-2113995703, the `reflect` function may cause partition pruning to does not take effect. So I propose to add a new `try_url_decode` function.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nadd a new function\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded tests and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to refactor `HiveQuerySuite` and `fix` bug, includes:\r\n- use `getWorkspaceFilePath` to enable `HiveQuerySuite` to run successfully in the IDE.\r\n- make the test `lookup hive UDF in another thread` `independence`, without relying on the previous UT `current_database with multiple sessions`.\r\n- enable two test: `non-boolean conditions in a CaseWhen are illegal` and `Dynamic partition folder layout`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Run successfully in the `IDE`\r\n  Before:\r\n  <img width=\"1288\"

Because the previous UT `current_database with multiple sessions`  changed `current database` and was not restored after it finished running.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in a corner case of JSON parsing when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled.\r\n\r\nWhen running the following query with the config set to true: \r\n```\r\nselect from_json('{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":\"d\"}', 'array<struct<a:string, c:int>>')\r\n```\r\nthe code would fail with \r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 4.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: \r\nLost task 0.0 in stage 4.0 (TID 4) (ip-10-110-51-101.us-west-2.compute.internal executor driver): \r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String cannot be cast to class \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayData (org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String and \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayData are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:53)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray$(rows.scala:53)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:172)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.JsonToStructs.$anonfun$converter$2(jsonExpressions.scala:831)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.JsonToStructs.nullSafeEval(jsonExpressions.scala:893)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe patch fixes the issue by re-throwing PartialArrayDataResultException if parsing fails in this special case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes the bug that would prevent users from reading objects as arrays as introduced in SPARK-19595. This is more of a special case but it works with the flag off so it would be good to fix it when the flag is on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, but it is a bug fix so it would not have worked without this patch overall.\r\nThe parsing output will be different due to the partial results improvement: \r\n\r\nPreviously, we would get `null` (the partial results are disabled). With this patch and partial results enabled, this will return `Array([b, null])`. This is not specific to this patch but rather to the partial results feature in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45125, we handled the case where an Aggregate is folded into a Project, causing a count bug. We missed cases where:\r\n1. The entire ScalarSubquery's plan is regarded as empty relation, and is folded completely. \r\n2. There are operations above the Aggregate in the subquery (such as filter and project).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes that by adding the case handling in ConstantFolding and OptimizeSubqueries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. There was a correctness error which happens when the scalar subquery is count-bug-susceptible, and empty, and thus folded by `ConstantFolding`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded SQL query tests in `scalar-subquery-count-bug.sql`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

This means any table change will remove the clustering columns from the table.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by removing the `ClusterByTransform` only when there is a `ClusterBy` table change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAmend existing test to catch this bug.\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

`connect.Column.to_plan` takes long time when creating proto plans if there are many `connect.Column` objects, although the call sites on `connect.Column.to_plan` are not necessary.\r\n\r\nE.g.,\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n\r\ndf = createDataFrame()\r\ndef schema():\r\n    return df.select(*([F.col(\"a\"), F.col(\"b\"), F.col(\"c\"),

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse isolated JobArtifactSet for each spark session\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsider multi user use same spark cluster with independent spark session, for example Kyuubi group session share level\r\n\r\nUser may use different udf jar to register function, but may has same name udf in different udf jar.\r\nIn this case, the valid udf class is always the class from the first load udf jar, this not meet users expections, user want use the udf class for the jar load by themself\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test in SessionJobArtifactStateSuite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SET` statement is used to set config values and it has a poorly designed grammar rule `#setConfiguration` that matches everything after `SET` - `SET .*?`. This conflicts with the usage of `SET` for setting session variables, and we needed to introduce `SET (VAR | VARIABLE)` grammar rule to make distinction between setting the config values and session variables - [SET VAR pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40474).\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not by SQL standard, so for SQL scripting ([JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48338)) we are opting to disable `SET` for configs and use it only for session variables. This enables use to use only `SET` for setting values to session variables. Config values can still be set from SQL scripts using `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`.\r\n\r\nThis change simply reorders grammar rules to achieve above behavior, and alters only visitor functions where name of the rule had to be changed or completely new rule was added.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are supposed to resolve the issues poorly designed `SET` statement for the case of SQL scripts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nThis PR is in a series of PRs that will introduce changes to sql() API to add support for SQL scripting, but for now, the API remains unchanged.\r\nIn the future, the API will remain the same as well, but it will have new possibility to execute SQL scripts.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAlready existing tests should cover the changes.\r\nNew tests for SQL scripts were added to:\r\n- `SqlScriptingParserSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn order to resolve the named parameters on the subtree, BindParameters recurses into the subtrees and tries to match the pattern with the named parameters. If there's no named parameter in the current level, the rule tries to return the unchanged plan. However, instead of returning the current plan object, the rule always returns the captured root plan node, leading into the infinite recursion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nInfinite recursion with the named parameters and the global limit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to set the upper bound version of 'sphinxcontrib-*' in `dev/requirements.txt` with `sphinx==4.5.0`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, if Spark developers use the command `pip install --upgrade -r dev/requirements.txt` directly to install python-related dependencies, the automatically installed `sphinxcontrib-*` versions don't match `sphinx==4.5.0`. Refered to the issue: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/11890. \r\n\r\nThen they execute the `make html` command for building pySpark docs and the following error will appear:\r\n<img width=\"1211\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/16032294/719c4b1d-9b7d-4ba9-89c5-ec3c0dc4572f\">\r\n\r\nThis problem has been avoided through pinning `sphinxcontrib-*` in workflows of Spark GA:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/16032294/bf4906f1-a76d-47bd-af42-f263537f371c)\r\n\r\nSo we can do the similar way by setting the upper bound version of in `requirements.txt` and it will be helpful for Spark developers when making pySpark docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr is trying to fix the syntax issues with GenericUDF since 3.5.0. The problem arose from DeferredObject currently passing a value instead of a function, which prevented users from catching exceptions in GenericUDF, resulting in semantic differences.\r\n\r\nHere is an example case we encountered. Originally, the semantics were that udf_exception would throw an exception, while udf_catch_exception could catch the exception and return a null value. However, currently, any exception encountered by udf_exception will cause the program to fail.\r\n```\r\nselect udf_catch_exception(udf_exception(col1)) from table\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor before Spark 3.5, we directly made the GenericUDF's DeferredObject lazy and evaluated the children in `function.evaluate(deferredObjects)`.\r\nNow, we would run the children's code first. If an exception is thrown, we would make it lazy to GenericUDF's DeferredObject.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNewly added UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen running sql on valid datasource files directly, if the given path is an empty string, we currently report UNSUPPORTED_DATASOURCE_FOR_DIRECT_QUERY, which claims the datasource is invalid. The reason is that the `hadoop.Path` class can not be constructed with empty strings and we wrap `IAE` with UNSUPPORTED_DATASOURCE_FOR_DIRECT_QUERY.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we check the path ahead to avoid this ambiguous error message\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ntrivial bugfix, although this error rarely occurs in REPL environments but might still get a chance to happen when using the query with string interpolation. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, different error class\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew tests\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

changes needed?\r\nTo distinguish column names when the `collationName` argument is used by `collate`. Before the changes, columns might conflict like the example below, and that could confuse users:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMP VIEW tbl as (SELECT collate('A', 'UTF8_BINARY'), collate('A', 'UTF8_LCASE'))\")\r\n```\r\n- Before:\r\n```\r\n[COLUMN_ALREADY_EXISTS] The column `collate(a)` already exists. Choose another name or rename the existing column. SQLSTATE: 42711\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [COLUMN_ALREADY_EXISTS] The column `collate(a)` already exists.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR throws an error when `CREATE TABLE LIKE` SQL command is used on V2 tables\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrior to this change `CREATE TABLE LIKE` was converted to the `CreateTableLikeCommand` V1 command directly in the parser layer. This change uses the new resolution framework to create a `CreateTableLike` logical node which is then converted to a V1 `CreateTableLikeCommand` for V1 tables and throws an error for V2 tables. A future PR will add support for `CREATE TABLE LIKE` with V2 tables.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFor V1 tables, if the source table does not exist, previously it would throw a `NoSuchTableException` within the command implementation. However now since table resolution is done in the Analyzer, a non-existent source table will throw an `AnalysisException`. This behavior change is common for all commands onboarded to the new table resolution framework.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests for V1 tables. New unit tests for V2 tables.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11536 added a `binary` toggle parameter to `CountVectorizer`, but the parameter evaluation occurs inside of the vectorizer UDF itself: this causes expensive parameter reading to occur once-per-row instead of once-per-transform.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by updating the code to only read the parameter once, similar to what was already being done for the `minTf` parameter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAddress a performance issue.\r\n\r\nI spotted this issue when I saw the
