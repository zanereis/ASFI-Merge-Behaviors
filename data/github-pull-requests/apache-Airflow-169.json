#19538\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases in which the existing `multiple_outputs` inference in the TaskFlow API doesn't automatically unfurl a returned dictionary into separate `XComs`:\r\n- The return type annotation of the TaskFlow function is the basic `dict` type\r\n- In Python 3.6, the inference fails to set `multiple_outputs` to True due to use of an incorrect attr\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the inference on a simple `dict` return type annotation and adds a condition for Python 3.6 use.\r\n\r\n> Since Python 3.6 will reach EOL on 2021-12-23, happy to drop the `sys.version_info` check if this fix wouldn't be included in a minor release before support for Python 3.6 is dropped.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR attempts to remove the remaining instances of uses dynamic values for `start_date` across the existing docs and added `catchup=False` where applicable as it is the latest best practice for examples

https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/19583\r\n\r\nFor prepared SQL statements, MSSQL uses `?` rather than `%s` for parameter markers. Currently, [MsSqlHook](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql/stable/_api/airflow/providers/microsoft/mssql/hooks/mssql/index.html) does not provide an implementation of `_generate_insert_sql` used by `insert_rows` making it impossible to use for instance [GenericTransfer](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/_api/airflow/operators/generic_transfer/index.html) with the said hooks.\r\n\r\nAs written, the PR implements `_generate_insert_sql` for MsSqlHook but in a limited way. That is, it will only allow us to do INSERTs (so when `replace=False`) but not UPSERTs (when `replace=True`). I would love to get some feedback and ideas for implementing the UPSERT even though it is not useful for my current use-case.\r\n\r\nNote that MSSQL does not support anything like \"REPLACE INTO\" for UPSERT. Instead, there seem to be two alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Try to do an update first and check `@@ROWCOUNT`: in case nothing was updated, do an insert. This is explained [here by Aaron Bertrand](https://sqlperformance.com/2020/09/locking/upsert-anti-pattern).\r\n\r\n- Use `MERGE`, many hits on StackOverflow such [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2479488/551375) explaining the syntax.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Aaron B. argues for the pattern in the first link because of several issues with `MERGE` (see [list of issues](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3074/use-caution-with-sql-servers-merge-statement/)).\r\n\r\nI spent a bit of time trying to implement either approach here, but got stuck after realizing it's not that straightforward to re-use parameter markers `?` from `values` from pyodbc `cursor.execute(sql, values)`. In any case, I was attempting to draw some inspiration from `_generate_insert_sql` of [PostgresHook](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-postgres/stable/_modules/airflow/providers/postgres/hooks/postgres.html#PostgresHook). Thus, this might need some work beyond just implementing `_generate_insert_sql` unless I'm missing something.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of KPO with the following goals:\r\n* simpler, easier-to-follow `execute` method\r\n* remove reliance on mutation of `pod` and `namespace` instance attributes\r\n~* change the default to delete pods~\r\n~* allow usage of kubernetes hook (waiting on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/19695 before implementing)~\r\n\r\n## Notes on changes\r\n\r\n### pod_launcher.py\r\n\r\n#### changes to launcher\r\n\r\n`start_pod` split up into two steps:\r\n\r\n* `create_pod` asynchronously creates the pod\r\n* `await_pod_start` waits for it to leave the `Pending` phase\r\n\r\n`monitor_pod` split up into two components\r\n\r\n* `follow_container_logs`: this bit of logic was previously in `monitor_pod` and invoked only if `get_logs` is true.  it also monitored for completion of the base container in this case.  here we pull that `if self.get_logs` decisionmaking up to the `execute` method for greater transparency, and we parameterize the `follow_container_logs` method so that it could be used for any container (and also make it more transparent which container it is following).\r\n* `monitor_pod` remains and does two things: wait for pod to reach a phase that is terminal, and harvest xcom if applicable.\r\n\r\n#### PodStatus -> PodPhase\r\n\r\nI rename the `PodStatus` enums to have the same case the actual kubernetes phase values.  I do not think that we need to lower them and doing so introduces a need for more status evaluation methods.\r\n\r\nI also do away with the way pod `phase` was always translated to task states.  It's more transparent to handle the phases directly.  In the old code sometimes you would look at the \"task state\" -- which the pod phase had been translated to -- in order to infer the pod phase; better to be more direct.  In any case these two changes allow us to chop a few methods.\r\n\r\n#### misc\r\n\r\n### kubernetes_pod.py\r\n\r\n#### simplified `execute`\r\n\r\nThe main goal here was simplifying the execute method so it's easier to follow.  I tried to better reveal the key orchesration decisions that have to be made _(e.g. do we get logs or not; do we get xcom or not; do we find a pod or create one)_, and provide a clearer separation of the processess that can be separated.\r\n\r\n#### other\r\nI moved the \"get client\" logic to a cached property.\r\n\r\nI did away with mutation of the `self.pod` attribute, and none of the methods reference the attribute directly -- the object is always passed to them in the method.  And I made a clear separation between the pod request object (which is used when a new pod is created) and pod -- the pod we're actually monitoring e.g. if we find a pod after failure and resume..\r\n\r\nSimilar for `self.namespace` which was mutated in the run without an obvious reason.  The reason was that sometimes operator namespace is none but through templates or whatever you have a namespace and when you go to find a pod you need the namespace.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-13T06:23:38Z","updated_at":"2021-12-30T03:44:35Z","closed_at":"2021-12-29T16:20:38Z","merged_at":"2021-12-29T16:20:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"f200bb1977655455f8acb79c9bd265df36f8ffce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

a trigger will complete and be deleted from the `TriggerRunner.triggers` dictionary attr before the the TriggerJob has had a chance to `submit_event`.  So TriggerRunner thinks it needs to create the trigger [again], which it does.\r\n\r\nOne way to resolve this is to have TriggerJob mark `is_submitted` after successful complletion of `submit_event`, and then have the cleanup process wait for this.  But I'm not sure if perhaps we will need to implement monitoring / timeouts if for some reason the event is never submitted; in that case we'd want to ensure that the trigger is re-run.\r\n\r\nShould

`SalesforceHook` was previously requiring all connection extras, however with secrets backends it is now possible to provide one extra at a time. The current setup was directly accessing keys of the extras json which would result in a `KeyError` if you leave out one of them.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows for just the minimum required extras to be provided for each Salesforce connection method as defined in the docstring of the `SalesforceHook`: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/e9a72a4e95e6d23bae010ad92499cd7b06d50037/airflow/providers/salesforce/hooks/salesforce.py#L55-L60\r\n\r\nIn addition to allowing for only the required extras it also still allows for all of the extras to be provided, such as the case currently when the connection is added via the UI.\r\n\r\nWhen making the connection the hook will explicitly default to `None` for all extras except for \"version\" (which defaults to the default API version). The reason for this is because `simple-salesforce` already has built-in authentication-choosing methods that relies on which arguments are `None` and without having `or None` in the code then setting this connection in the UI will result in the blank extras being empty strings instead of None, which would break the connection if `get` was used on its own.\r\n\r\nThe tests for the hook are also updated to only test for the required connection params when testing connections and also test that if all extras are empty strings they will be defaulted to `None`.\r\n\r\nAlso, a thank you @gigatexal, @dstandish, @josh-fell for prior PRs and PR discussions regarding this fix. This PRs incorporates the discussed points.\r\n\r\ncloses: #19506\r\ncompletes PR #18929 by adding tests\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is an ongoing effort to enhance example DAGs by setting static values for `start_date`, ensuring `catchup=False` is set, among other small improvements.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the second batch of updates for google cloud example dags, and it makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Use static start_date\r\n- Use catchup=False\r\n- Tidy up the chaining of tasks in some cases\r\n- Remove unnecessary specification of default conn ids\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Airflow 2.2.1 we introduced a fix in #18953 where the corrupted\r\ndata was moved to a separate table. However some of our users\r\n(rightly) might not have the context. We've never had anything\r\nlike that before, so the users who treat Airflow DB as\r\nblack-boxes might get confused on what the error means and what\r\nthey should do in this case.\r\n\r\nYou can see it in #19440 converted into discussion #19444 and #19421\r\nindicate that the message is a bit unclear for users. This PR attempts to\r\nimprove that it adds `upgrading` section to our documentation and have the\r\nmessage link to it so that rather than asking questions in the issues,\r\nusers can find context and answers what they should do in our docs.\r\n\r\nIt also guides the users who treat Airflow DB as \"black-box\" on how they\r\ncan use their tools and airflow db shell to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

log of SparkSql Operator will go to infinite loop, forever printing `INFO - b''`.\r\n\r\nThe reason is at line 185 in SparkSql.py : \r\n`subprocess.Popen(spark_sql_cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, **kwargs)`\r\nIt should pass `universal_newlines=True` into this function, as what spark_submit.py do. \r\n\r\nThe default values of this function are: universal_newlines=False，meaning input/output is accepted as bytes, not Unicode strings plus the universal newlines mode handling.\r\n\r\n[As is discussed in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38181494/what-is-the-difference-between-using-universal-newlines-true-with-bufsize-1-an): \r\n> If universal_newlines=False then `for line in iter(self._sp.stdout)` iterates over b'\\n'-separated lines. If the process uses non-ascii encoding e.g., UTF-16 for its output then even if os.linesep == '\\n' on your system; you may get a wrong result. If you want to consume text lines, use the text mode: pass universal_newlines=True or use io.TextIOWrapper(process.stdout) explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description
