enough disk space in GitHub Actions, and I found out that it's because we didn't specify the `openresty/openresty` tag in the `Dockerfile`, testcontainers pulls all images, hence run out of the disk space. I've filed an issue in testcontainers repo to confirm whether it's a bug or not, and work around this problem by specify the tag explicitly.

Fix deadlock problem when using es\r\n- [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [x] Explain briefly about why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n\r\nHello, a few days ago, there was a problem that es data could not be written in our production environment. We dump the thread stack of the production environment. After analysis, it is found that es client has a deadlock problem when writing data.thread dump [thread dump](https://thread.share.perfma.com/detail/1969879/overview). In order to solve the problem, I checked many related materials, and found that this problem has been fixed in elasticsearch-client version 7.5.0. [Prevent deadlock by using separate schedulers](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/48697)\r\n so i update the elasticsearch client 7.0.0 to elasticsearch client 7.5.0.\r\nIn order to avoid es compatibility issues, I use elasticsearch server 7.0.0 as data storage. Tested whether the ui function is normal, and checked whether the OAP is abnormal during operation. The test results show that everything is normal. and the current elasticsearch server in our production environment is 7.2.0, and we are also using elasticsearch client 7.5.0. It has been running stably for 3 days without any compatibility issues.","created_at":"2020-11-02T08:47:56Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T07:00:52Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T14:01:55Z","merged_at":"2020-11-03T14:01:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9d756cd536eee72d1edda69fe495fbb7f253937","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hanahmily","id":1960537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjA1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1960537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily","html_url":"https://github.com/hanahmily","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

StatefulSet, or others. It's freaky and different from the Istio Kubernetes registry. And the service name pattern changed in recent Kubernetes versions, which generates weird service names in the topology.\r\n\r\nThe new path is pod -> endpoint -> service, and we should leverage Informer API instead of raw Kubernetes API.\r\n\r\n- [x] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.
