Since Symbolic mode of training always does updates on server, it generally has no issue. But Gluon provides the flexibility to determine whether to update weights on server or worker using `update_on_kvstore`. Also the default value for this is false, i.e. to perform weight updates on worker. This results in crash when using async mode with Gluon as this person realized https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11855. We need to prevent users from running into this.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test

Description ##\r\nThis is a small PR to remove the additional 3 layers in the network to keep it similar to the lenet-5 architecture and python lenet Example. \r\nWith the additional 3 layers, users running this examples would see the time to process each epoch to be twice than the python version of the example and raises concern that it might an issue with the APIs. \r\nI have also changed the Opitmizer to `sgd` similar to Python.\r\nThe accuracy of this model is still pretty bad and needs fixing, this is in my todo unless someone wants to pick up #11901 \r\n\r\nTime taken after removing 3 layers(conv,pool,activation)\r\n```\r\n[21:16:06] lenet.cpp:173: Epoch [0] Time cost :2.16074, accuracy: 0.0992187\r\n[21:16:08] lenet.cpp:173: Epoch [1] Time cost :1.80743, accuracy:

Description ##\r\n* Remove all stale and deprecated Keras1.2 with MXNet tests and cleaning up. \r\n* Keras 1.2.1 with MXNet backend is no more supported and deprecated - https://github.com/dmlc/keras/\r\n* Most recent release and active development is happening for Keras2 with MXNet backend - https://github.com/awslabs/keras-apache-mxnet\r\n* Keras2-MXNet has is own CI and build pipelines.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Removing obsolete unused Keras1-MXNet tests from MXNet repo\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu @roywei

Description ##\r\ntest_l2_normalization should be no more flaky, getting rid of the fixed seed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Getting rid of fixed seed\r\n- [x] Refactor the test to make it randomized and shorter\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nCan pass more than 10000

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe website was displaying the versions based on the build of the branch names and not any minor version updates. For example, even though we're on v1.2.1 code, we're displaying v1.2.0 in the dropdown.\r\n\r\n![2018-07-25_15-11-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5974205/43230466-2ed95e2a-901d-11e8-9fbf-bce5aecef006.png)\r\n\r\nI implemented new Jenkins and website build logic that allows you to control the display from Jenkins. You can now map code from a branch or a tag to whatever display name you want. Here I've updated 1.2.0 to say 1.2.1.\r\n \r\n![2018-07-25_15-10-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5974205/43230470-34f9d906-901d-11e8-9a15-539da05ef244.png)\r\n\r\nA preview is here: http://34.201.8.176/versions/1.2.1/index.html\r\nA smaller, limited versions test Jenkins run is here: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/test-website-build/5/console\r\nAfter I run a complete, all versions test run this PR should be ready to roll.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] Code changes are complete - several Jenkins-related updates are needed once this PR is about to be merged:\r\n    - [x] docs/Jenkinsfile: I removed \"reserved-$node\", so I could test. \"reserved\" needs to be added back before merge. **UPDATE: added this back and see post-merge notes below**\r\n\r\n![2018-07-25_15-40-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5974205/43231421-25c09548-9021-11e8-80dc-7249fe4634f6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. CI will call an updated Jenkinsfile in /docs that will run the test jobs on unrestricted nodes. (This file should be reverted once the PR is approved.)\r\n1. CI's runtime_functions will now send the tag_list param (what to display) to the build script (build_all_version.sh) that builds each branch as a new version of the site.\r\n1. build_all_version.sh will build each version and put the artifacts into the folders that were defined in the new display param.\r\n1. update_all_version.sh picks up like before and injects the versions dropdown, but now will have new versions display (1.2.1 instead of 1.2.0).\r\n\r\n### Important for Post-Merge\r\n\r\n- [x] Jenkins job - restricted-website-build - this production job should be updated to use the new tag capability where you can choose tags or branches for tags to build. This requires the \"v\" to be appended to each. Then for the `tag_list` param, you use the display you want. So for branch`v1.2.0` you use `1.2.1` and for `v0.12.0` you use `0.12.1`. **Just copy the `tags_list` and `tags_to_build` settings in the test-website-build pipeline.**","created_at":"2018-07-25T22:49:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-29T19:39:43Z","closed_at":"2018-07-29T19:39:43Z","merged_at":"2018-07-29T19:39:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab5242c1919cefed6d69106b6f81645fa320bed3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11892/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11892/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11892/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c24ce4c91571fa8694b1d25943b6918f44352416","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:version-dropdown-update","ref":"version-dropdown-update","sha":"c24ce4c91571fa8694b1d25943b6918f44352416","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFrom the comments under #11176 seems like there's a wide confusion on the error messages in cudnn convolution operators, enhancing the error messages so that we give hints to users to reduce confusion.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Enhancement of error messages in cudnn_conv\r\n- [x] Enhancement of error messages in cudnn_deconv\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@ThomasDelteil

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where custom operators get deregistered while upgrading a model which was trained in a previous version of mxnet. During the upgrade process the engine calls the custom operator method opPropDel every time it encounters a customer operator which it's already seen. The code had a counter that did nothing until the 3rd time called then deregistered the operator. This caused an whenever the same custom operator was encountered 3 times (either by loading in the model multiple times or loading a model which used the operator multiple times).\r\n\r\nThe fix is to basically do nothing during the delete callback. The purpose of the callback seems to be to clean up resources that were allocated during the creator function and our creator function isn't allocating any new resources but is instead reinitializing existing resources which were created during the Operator.register call.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nSupport int32 type for labels in ImageIter. By default, labels are of type float and therefore lead to precision issues.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-664], \r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are not affected by this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added a new parameter to ImageIter that specifies the dtype of the label. By default, it is set to float32, which was the case in the old code.\r\n- Modified test_imageiter() unit test to test the new parameter with int32, float32, int64, float64.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- RecordIO and ImageDetIter have not been changed.\r\n- The example (profiler_imageiter.py) is unaffected\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-24T00:06:24Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T04:24:01Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T04:24:01Z","merged_at":"2018-07-26T04:24:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5b95b090815e879b57dca233604dcb3f1df967a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/321fe08fdbfe445d156c2201c2201e4fde17d0f2","head":{"label":"vandanavk:python_bugs","ref":"python_bugs","sha":"321fe08fdbfe445d156c2201c2201e4fde17d0f2","user":{"login":"vandanavk","id":9017059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTcwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9017059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk","html_url":"https://github.com/vandanavk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140875279,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA4NzUyNzk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"vandanavk/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vandanavk","id":9017059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTcwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9017059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk","html_url":"https://github.com/vandanavk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vandanavk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vandanavk/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR includes massive changes on all Iterators that extends `DataIter`, two new fields are added (`dtype` and `layout`).\r\n\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres \r\n\r\nIt intends to solve some issues about the layout information missing in DataDesc. For example: RNN based networks require different layouts(“TNC”/”NTC”). Current implementation of DataBatch, DataIter does not support different layouts and assumes a fixed layout based on the shape of the NDArray returned in the next() call to the iterator.\r\n\r\nHowever I found it hard to have a general solution that both address backward compatibility as well as adding this information. Currently, there are several ways to address this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Assume Shape == 2 follows `NT` format, Shape == 3 follows `TNC`, Shape == 4 follows `NCHW` and only change the implicit function in [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/scala-package/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/mxnet/IO.scala#L358-L363).\r\n\r\n2. Add `Layout` and `DType` defs for all iterator, then users can pass these information to create `DataDesc` instead of `ListMap[Name, Shape]`. However, it breaks the input args for `NDArrayIter` as well as other iterators. Users are required to add more inputs. However, if the iterator are passed in with dynamic shapes (shapes are not determined), it will break the DataDesc checking scheme. \r\n\r\n3. Do what 2 contains and create `this` constructor to make sure BC.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n- [x] IOSuite\r\n- [ ] ModuleSuite\r\n- [x] DataIterSuite\r\n\r\n## Historical issues\r\n-

with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFix for issue #11411.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] kAddTo in backward pass\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNote: No need to add kAddTo support for forward pass, actually there's no way to specify req to be kAddTo for forward computation.\r\nNew version of test_new_softmax passed more than 10000 trials on both CPU & GPU:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nosetests --verbose

Description ##\r\nThe current quantization strategy for `calib_mode='entropy'` is to calculate the KL divergence for different thresholds and choose the best threshold. This assumes that the random variable is nonzero for all reals and is a continuous random variable. Because we are discretizing the distribution, we smooth the distribution over the range `[-threshold, threshold]`. What we are not considering is that the entire sampled distribution may be not in the range `[-threshold, threshold]` and thus we end up with all zeros in the sampled candidate `p` distribution inside of `_get_optimal_threshold`.\r\n\r\nI have added a check that the distribution(possibly unnormalized) is proper before attempting to smooth or else we'll run into a divide by 0 error.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, activation functions and layers for classification type problems output numbers symmetric around 0. This is not the case for a regressor's last layer, and there are various other examples where the activation distribution is not around 0, and this was a major blockage for airbnb's adoption into mxnet's quantization capabilities.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added tests and extra code inside of quantization.py to set all kl divergence to infinity if the probability distribution formed is all zeros. Also there are some typos and one-off-errors in the original implementation that are now

Description ##\r\nAdd C++ test for LRN MKLDNN operator.\r\nExtend testing framework to filter certain types of test inputs / outputs.\r\nAdded note: LRN (fcompute) does not support kWriteInPlace / AddTo\r\nRefactored LRN Execute to conform to standard (accepts out_data as input, rename SetDataHandle \r\nand SetNewMem)\r\nreorder LRN backward in_data (added TODO since this can be optimized)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add C++ test for LRN MKLDNN operator.\r\n- [x] renamed variable names to be more readable.\r\n- [x Updated LRN Execute and SetDataHandle (changed to SetNewMem) to conform to MKLDNN API)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-19T17:50:29Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T21:16:23Z","closed_at":"2018-07-20T21:16:23Z","merged_at":"2018-07-20T21:16:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"95de76758a18fc070fac11bcd1d2d24a5263a1df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c4505c8b5c4fbc688f53e1db707a8e4c693f714a","head":{"label":"samskalicky:sskalic_branch","ref":"sskalic_branch","sha":"c4505c8b5c4fbc688f53e1db707a8e4c693f714a","user":{"login":"samskalicky","id":1541993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1541993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky","html_url":"https://github.com/samskalicky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141610373,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE2MTAzNzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"samskalicky/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"samskalicky","id":1541993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1541993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky","html_url":"https://github.com/samskalicky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskalicky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/samskalicky/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nFix for #10709  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Change dot(csr.T, dns) = dns to a deterministic algorithm\r\n- [x] Test for determinism of dot(csr.T, dns) = dns\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNew determinism test passed 10000 times on local machine.\r\nCorrectness check, which takes longer time to run (~5s/trial), have already passed more than 10000 times at this moment.","created_at":"2018-07-19T17:27:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T19:43:06Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T01:05:52Z","merged_at":"2018-07-26T01:05:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"302aae33bf2c60187b869cc643b1489e5739e974","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":720179133,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjAxNzkxMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Sparse","name":"Sparse","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c561e6c20a37f99227b77f3834317c59c1b8bfb2","head":{"label":"haojin2:fix_dot_determinism","ref":"fix_dot_determinism","sha":"c561e6c20a37f99227b77f3834317c59c1b8bfb2","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"haojin2/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-19T09:45:27Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T05:21:12Z","closed_at":"2018-07-20T03:00:38Z","merged_at":"2018-07-20T03:00:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d7166fd3de3bab62c4221a54ffa475344df4456","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4b3ab1fe22f30523eadfd5dbe4e8e0f5438e58b8","head":{"label":"cclauss:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"4b3ab1fe22f30523eadfd5dbe4e8e0f5438e58b8","user":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9b30af2c6cfbb868ff15e4da59fb8d030808b830","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nSpatial transformer op produced incorrect results with `USE_CUDA=ON` `USE_CUDNN=OFF` till now. This was due to separate threads writing to the same global memory locations causing undefined behavior.\r\nReplaced all such writes with `atomicAdd`.

tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Modify the backward of take and embedding to use the previous AddTakeGrad kernel\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@leezu I've used the script in

Description ##\r\nUsing BucketingModule together with a DataBatch in which the `provideLabel` field is not set triggers a NullPointerException in `BucketingModule.forward(...)`. This happens because the implicit method `ListMap2Descs` tries to convert `ListMap[String, Shape]` into `IndexedSeq[DataDesc]` but fails because the former is null by default. A simple fix is to do a null check in the implicit method.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with

Description ##\r\nThe previous JavaDoc generation is causing too much warning messages. This PR is intend to reduce the numbers of issues we have as indicated in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11603.\r\n\r\nThere are three fixs:\r\n-  Seq[NDArray] erasure problem, same explained in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1094173/how-do-i-get-around-type-erasure-on-scala-or-why-cant-i-get-the-type-paramete)\r\n- Add `<pre>` tag on `JavaDoc` to reduce warnings\r\n- Minor fixing on the other files\r\n\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nThere is no need to make the full package when we make docs for the MXNet website. So I create a specific make goals for that to reduce the compile time.\r\n@aaronmarkham @nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres\r\n\r\n`make scaladocgen`\r\n\r\nIt doesn't looks elegant, please suggest a better way if you know one I can do with Maven.\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nDisable flaky Caffe test due to regression of issue: #11407.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThe second commit in (#11316)  _Read MXNET_FORCE_ADDTAKEGRAD to a static variable_ https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11316/commits/a90048569abfe3341cebe25417ec9de0446b94cc unintendedly changed the default behavior and made forcing the use of AddTakeGrad kernel default, not following the semantics suggeste by `MXNET_FORCE_ADDTAKEGRAD=0`. This PR fixes that and changes the default behavior only when `MXNET_FORCE_ADDTAKEGRAD=1` is specified.\r\n\r\nIe. if merging this PR as is, mxnet will be back to using a faster but buggy kernel and users must specify `MXNET_FORCE_ADDTAKEGRAD=1` if they want to use the correct kernel.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Fix

Description ##\r\nThis patch fixes a regression in the R installation in CI.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nRelates to: #11601 #11602\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWithout manually adding the key we're getting occasional gpg server errors (happens approx 1/10 requests).  My understanding is this change was made to align with documentation.  Would like to chat about the tradeoffs with @aaronmarkham  and @anirudh2290, but it's important that we keep the CI stable for other MXNet developers.  Is the main concern with adding the key manually that it doesn't align with documentation?  Would you be alright with me updating the doc instructions (I can include updated instructions in this

for the `while_loop` operator to be merged so that I could rebase to master. Please do not merge for now.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the proposal of adding a set of control flow operators to MXNet. [Link](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Optimize+dynamic+neural+network+models+with+control+flow+operators) to proposal. See also `foreach` (#11531) and `while_loop` (#11566).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add `ifelse` operator in src/operator/control_flow.cc\r\n\r\n### TODO ###\r\n- [x] Wait for `while_loop` to be merged\r\n- [x] Rebase to master\r\n- [x] Fix flaky tests in `while_loop` because of numeric overflow\r\n- [x] Remove duplicated benchmark

Description ##\r\nA second shot at #11672 but with __from six.moves import xrange__.\r\n\r\nFix undefined names found be flake8 F821 that are mostly (but not exclusively) related to Python 3.  Each undefined name has the potential to raise NameError at runtime.  Used the __six__ module as discussed at https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10833#issuecomment-404568638  Also see #11669\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nGPU builds are quite slow in CI.  This PR limits the number of GPU architectures we compile for to help speed it up.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nUser filed a bug when converting NDArray to numpy. The rootcause is due to the large tensor size that exceeds the current limit (32-bit unsigned integer). This fix is to replace the unsigned 32-bit integer by int64_t data type to index tensor size. \r\n\r\nI verified the fix using the following code from its original [issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11495):\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10807, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9207, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10158, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9304\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon, nd\r\nm = gluon.nn.Embedding(14000, 128)\r\nm.initialize()\r\nind = nd.zeros((700000, 128))\r\nx = m(ind)\r\nx.shape\r\ntest=x.asnumpy()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have run python memory_profiler and did not see noticeable memory footprint increase. I am still \r\nevaluating the performance in more cases.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones: test_large_array.py\r\n- [X ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X ] Changed the shape index from uint32_t to int64_t.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This PR is to fix a bug filed on Github. It is not verified to support large array in all operators or scenarios in MXNet. A project is needed to address large array support in a large scope.\r\n- This PR has a dependency on mshadow submodule. The related PR is

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this
