Description\r\n\r\nAdded caching for ConfigKey value retrievals based on the Caffeine in-memory caching library.\r\nhttps://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine\r\nCurrently, expire time for a cache is 30s and each update of the config key invalidates the cache. On any update or reset of the configuration, the cache automatically invalidates for it.\r\n\r\nThis useful when there are concurrent operations as it will prevent multiple DB queries within a short span of time.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the multi-arch zones, allowing users to select the VM arch upon deployment. \r\n\r\nMulti-arch zone support in CloudStack can allow admins to mix x86_64 & arm64 hosts within the same zone with the following changes proposed:\r\n- All hosts in a clusters need to be homogenous, wrt host CPU type (amd64 vs arm64) and hypevisor\r\n- Arch-aware templates & ISOs:\r\n   -  Add support for a new arch field (default set of: amd64 and arm64), when unspecified defaults to amd64 and for existing templates & iso\r\n   -  Allow admins to edit the arch type of the registered template & iso\r\n- Arch-aware clusters and host:\r\n   - Add new attribute field for cluster and hosts (kvm host agents can automatically report this, arch of the first host of the cluster is cluster's architecture), defaults to amd64 when not specified\r\n   - Allow admins to edit the arch of an existing cluster\r\n- VM deployment form (UI):\r\n   - In a multi-arch zone/env, the VM deployment form can allow some kind of template/iso filtration in the UI\r\n   - Users should be able to select arch: amd64 & arm64; but this is shown only in a multi-arch zone (env)\r\n- VM orchestration and lifecycle operations:\r\n   - Use of VM/template's arch to correctly decide where to provision the VM (on the correct strictly arch-matching host/clusters) & other lifecycle operations (such as migration from/to arch-matching hosts)\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New

Description\r\n\r\nWhen entering an activation rule during the creation and editing of Quota tariffs, the defined rule is not validated. This way, errors are only identified while processing the tariff.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the `quotaValidateActivationRule` API was created, which informs whether the activation rule is valid or not. Also, the activation rule field was added when creating and editing the tariff via UI.\r\n\r\n#### API parameters\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Description | Required |\r\n| ------ | ------ |  ------ |\r\n| activationrule | The activation rule that will be validated. | Yes |\r\n| quotaresourcetype | tariff usage type to validate the variables used in the _script_. | Yes |\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```\r\n🐱

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR filters out networks without access while getting networks with SG with free IPs. Otherwise a VM deployment could fail.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Setup a zone with SG\r\n2. Create two accounts A1, A2\r\n3. For both accounts create a network with SG. The network should allow access only to the current account.\r\n4. Launch a VM in account A2 without specifying the network.\r\nIf network is not specified, ACS picks up a network with Free IPs in the zone. In this case, the network picked up is from account A1.\r\nIf the VM gets deployed for some reason, try the above step again with the other account.\r\n\r\n**Expected:** VM should be launched successfully with network in account A2.\r\n\r\n**Actual:** VM is not launched because the network is not in the same account as the VM.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR

Description\r\n\r\nWhen credits are added to an account, an entry that represents the operation is created in `cloud_usage.quota_credits`. Some information about these entries is currently returned alongside an account's balance through the `quotaBalance` API. However, this is not consistent with the API's purpose (viewing an account's balance), and it is not possible to view the credit addition history for a whole domain with a single API call.\r\n\r\nIn order to make `quotaBalance` more consistent with its purpose, the credit addition history will be removed from its response alongside some enhancements to the API in the future. To list the credit addition history, this PR adds the `quotaCreditsList`, which has the following parameters:\r\n\r\n- `accountid`: ID of the account for which the credit statement will be generated.\r\n- `domainid`: ID of the domain for which credit statement will be generated. Available only for administrators.\r\n- `isrecursive`: Whether to generate the credit statement for the provided domain and its children. Defaults to false.\r\n- `startdate`: Start date of the statement. If not provided, the first day of the current month will be considered as the start date.\r\n- `enddate`: End date of the statement. If not provided, the current date will be considered as the end date.\r\n\r\nNo parameters are flagged as required, but at least `accountid` or `domainid` must be provided.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn my environment, there were the following domains and accounts:\r\n- `ROOT`: admin (root admin)\r\n- `ROOT/d1`: d1 (domain admin), u1 (user)\r\n\r\nFirst, in the root admin account, I added 100 credits to the three accounts; in the domain admin account, I added credits to d1 and u1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the project account (which is the resource owner id rather than the calling user account id) for all the events with project account owner, except for create project event.\r\n\r\nProject events are not missed, but calling account is added to scheduled events and project account is added to started, completed events. So, some of the events for the operation are in Default view and others in project View, which is confusing. This PR keeps project account for all events with with project account except for create project event.\r\n\r\nFixes #9432 \r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nThis changes the way how the linstor plugin sets the correct options to allow live-migration.\r\nBefore we set `allow-two-primaries` option on all resources and also don't enable protocol C for that brief time.\r\nNow we explicitly set `allow-two-primaries` and protocol C on the specific resource connection used and\r\nafter the live migration is done those options get removed.\r\n\r\nThis allows live migration to work if you have set protocol A between 2 datacenters (e.g. DR site).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #9413 \r\n\r\nThe original fix was to allow user to do actions (update, restart, delete) on the network only if the user owns the network and if user role is of Admin or domain admin.\r\n\r\nIf the network belongs to a project then the actions can be allowed as it belongs to only to that project.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to persist IP addresses related to VM access via CPVM. Specifically, it stores the IP address of the client accessing a VM and the IP address of the console endpoint creator. To achieve this, the `cloud.console_session` table was extended with two new columns: `client_address`, which stores the client's IP address, and `console_endpoint_creator_address`, which captures the IP address of the console endpoint creator.\r\n\r\nThese IP addresses were already being captured for logging and validation purposes. The console endpoint creator's IP is captured here, at the start of the `CreateConsoleEndpointCmd` execution:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/47a6b7011d7e42be86a748af50b87633147b5a90/api/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/command/user/consoleproxy/CreateConsoleEndpointCmd.java#L65-L68\r\n\r\nThe client address is captured by calling `session.getRemoteAddress().getAddress().getHostAddress()` in this method, that gets executed when the client connects to the console:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/47a6b7011d7e42be86a748af50b87633147b5a90/services/console-proxy/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/consoleproxy/ConsoleProxyNoVNCHandler.java#L157-L160\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I manually added the `client_address` and `console_endpoint_creator_address` columns to the `cloud.console_session` table.\r\n2. I generated a VM console endpoint.\r\n3. I executed the following query in order to validate whether the stored IP was correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>\r\n    <code>SELECT * FROM `cloud`.`console_session` ORDER BY created DESC LIMIT 1;</code>\r\n    </summary>\r\n\r\n| id | uuid | created | account_id | user_id | instance_id | host_id | acquired | removed | client_address | console_endpoint_creator_address |\r\n| -- | ---- | ---- |    ---- |       ---- |     ---- |       ---- |      ---- |    ---- |    ---- | ---- |\r\n| 2  | 77f08cea-8068-471f-9464-44810e1ef545 |2024-08-06 17:57:05 |2 | 2 | 14 | 1 | NULL | NULL | NULL | 192.168.122.1 |\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nAs can be noticed, the `console_endpoint_creator_address` column was populated accordingly, whereas the `client_adress` was still empty since the VM had not been accessed yet.\r\n\r\n4. I accessed the VM via CPVM.\r\n5. I executed the following query in order to validate whether the client stored IP was correct.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>\r\n    <code>SELECT * FROM `cloud`.`console_session` ORDER BY created

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to deploy VRs on dedicated resources, even if they are dedicated to the domain in which the VR will be created.\r\n\r\nA new global configuration `allowRoutersOnDedicatedResources` has been created to allow VRs to be deployed on hosts, clusters, pods and zones that are dedicated to their respective domains. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWith the configuration marked as true:\r\n\r\n* I dedicated resources to the domain in which the VRs would be deployd and verified that the deploy worked normally.\r\n* I dedicated resources to an account in that domain and verified that I could not deploy VRs on these resources.\r\n* I dedicated resources to a different domain and verified that I could not deploy VRs on these resources.\r\n\r\nI marked

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes migrate primary storage for Linstor primary storage.\r\nAlways use RAW as copy sourceFormat for Linstor devices, as all images are stored as RAW on Linstor, but we have to pretend to use qcow2 to be able to use qcow2 as snapshot format. Also use .getPath() for resource names, as they are altered after a primary storage migration.\r\nFixes: #9176 and #9522\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nAllows configuring connection pool library for database connection. As default, replaces dbcp2 connection pool library with more performant HikariCP.\r\n\r\n`db.<DATABASE>.connectionPoolLib` property can be set in the `db.properties` to use the desired library.\r\nSet `dbcp` for using DBCP2\r\nSet `hikaricp` or <EMPTY> for using HikariCP\r\n\r\nPer docs, if the mysql connector is JDBC2 compliant then it should use the Connection.isValid API to test a connection.\r\n(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#isValid-int-)\r\n\r\nThis would significantly reduce query lags and API throughput, as for every SQL query one or two SELECT 1 are performed every time a Connection is given to application logic.\r\n\r\nThis should only be accepted when the driver is JDBC4 complaint.\r\n\r\nAs per the docs, the connector-j can use /* ping */ before calling SELECT 1 to have light weight application pings to the server:\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-usagenotes-j2ee-concepts-connection-pooling.html\r\n\r\nRelated doc PR:

Description\r\n\r\nAPI access keypairs are primarily used to support interactions between systems, without the need to create sessions (through user and password authentication). Currently, CloudStack's implementation of API keypairs does not allow you to specify permissions for each keypair, simply using the account's default permissions. Additionally, the number of keypairs is limited to one per user and they have no start and end dates.\r\n\r\nAn extension of the API keypairs functionality was implemented, adding several new features that increase flexibility and security. It is now possible to specify a subset of permissions (from the base account) for each keypair, as well as create more than one key per user. It is also possible to define start and end dates for the validity of a keypair. A key created without an expiration date will always be valid up until it is deleted. It should be noted that creating API keypairs without specifying permissions just creates an API keypair with all account's base permissions. Also, API keypairs older than this patch will always be viewed as keypairs with full account permissions.\r\n\r\nThe following endpoints were created:\r\n\r\nA new `listUserKeys` API was added. Through this API the user will be able to specify a single `keypairid` to fetch its specific properties, or `apikeyfilter` to return a specific keypair based on an `apikey`. The user can inform an `userid` to fetch an user's api keypair list. If no `keypairid`, `apikeyfilter` or `userid` is provided, the API defaults to fetching information on the calling user. The `listall` property allows for fetching all keypairs in the structure that are visible based on the calling user/keypair permissions, if not specified, it defaults to false, fetching only the apikeys on the level of the calling user/keypair. Also, it is possible to inform `showpermissions` to list all permissions associated with each returned `apikey`.\r\n\r\n\r\n| **Name**              | **Description**                           | **Required**   | **Default** |\r\n|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|\r\n| userid                | id of the owner of the keypairs           | no             | none        |\r\n| keypairid             | id of the keypair                         | no             | none        |\r\n| listall               | list all accessable keypairs              | no             | false       |\r\n| apikeyfilter          | apikey of they keypair                    | no             | none        |\r\n| showpermissions       | lists all associated apikey permissions   | no             | false       | \r\n\r\n\r\nThe API `getUserKeys` was modified preserving backwards compatibility. It now fetches the last keypair created for the informed user.\r\n\r\nThe api `registerUserKeys` was modified so the new API keypair parameters could be specified on creation:\r\n\r\n| **Name**              | **Description**             | **Required**   | **Example**                                   | **Default**                        |\r\n|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|\r\n| id                    | user id                     | Yes            | b8914774-771e-11ee-8e59-5254003754dc          | none                                  |\r\n| name                  | name of the keypair         | No             | MyKey                                         | userId + \" - API Keypair\"          |\r\n| startdate             | date when key becomes valid | No             | 2024-04-09                                    | none                      |\r\n| enddate               | date when key expires       | No             | 2024-04-09                                    | never expires                  |\r\n| description           | keypair description         | No             | read only permissions                         | none                     |\r\n| rules                 | list of API access rules    | No             | rules[1].rule=list* rules[1].permission=allow | all user API permissions based on Account Role |\r\n\r\nA new keypair deletion API was added (`deleteUserKeys`).

I was able to create API keypairs through the UI through the button on the top right of the user view;\r\n2. Through Cloud Monkey, validated that the keypair had the same permissions as the base user by calling a series of APIs;\r\n\r\nMultiple Keys (via Cloud Monkey):\r\n1. Created multiple keys;\r\n2. Validated the operation was successful on the DB;\r\n3. Tested creating a key that was not valid and would become valid in the future, with success;\r\n4. Tested creating a key that was valid and would become invalid in the future, with success;\r\n5. Tested trying to create keys that were already invalid and got errors;\r\n6. All permissions of the API key pairs were consistent with each key pair tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Permissions Validation\r\n\r\nTested the permissions of keyrules listing, keypair listing, keypair deletion and keypair cretion with the following user/account/domain setup:\r\n\r\n- domain `/ROOT`\r\n  - account `root admin`\r\n    - user `root admin`\r\n    - user `user1`\r\n\r\n  - domain `subdomain`\r\n    - account `domain admin`\r\n      - user `domain admin`\r\n    - account `userAccount`\r\n      - user `user2`\r\n      - user `user3`\r\n\r\nThe following table describes the results obtained when the user on the first column attempted to operate on the keypairs of users on the first row (V: operation was possible, F: operation was not possible).\r\n\r\n| user      | rootAdm | user1 | domainAdm | user2 | user3 |\r\n| -----     | ------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |\r\n| rootAdm   | V | V | V | V | V |\r\n| user1     | V | V | V | V | V |\r\n| domainAdm | F | F | V | V | V |\r\n| user2     | F | F | F | V | F |\r\n| user3     | F | F | F | F | V |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Migration to `api_keypair` Table\r\n\r\n1. A key was created for a read-only user\r\n2. The database was updated from version `4.19` to `4.20`\r\n3. The API key data was successfully migrated to the `api_keypair` table, with the corresponding columns in the user table deleted.\r\n4. Confirmed correct permission handling of the api key.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### General validations\r\n\r\n- Could not create an API keypair with more permissions than the base keypair.\r\n- Deleting system keys was not possible. \r\n- After deleting a user or account, the API keypairs were invalidated.","created_at":"2024-08-08T15:04:39Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T11:13:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":956526498,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTY1MjY0OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:has-conflicts","name":"status:has-conflicts","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35/labels","id":11418179,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4ArjpD","number":35,"title":"4.21.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":150,"closed_issues":26,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-08-08T08:47:33Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T11:58:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/7f9e8ab17e2f372a6d6acd44e19570da6b891af8","head":{"label":"scclouds:api-keypair-restructure","ref":"api-keypair-restructure","sha":"7f9e8ab17e2f372a6d6acd44e19570da6b891af8","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_vie

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following preset variables to the usage type `RUNNING_VM`:\r\n\r\n`value.computeOffering.offerHa`: A boolean informing if the compute offering offers HA or not.\r\n\r\n`configuration.forceHa`: A boolean informing if the cluster configuration `force.ha` is enabled or not. Considering that `force.ha` is a configuration at cluster scope, the priority is to get the value from the cluster. If no value is specified in the cluster scope, the variable will use the global settings value.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![offerHa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57e12090-18dd-4b37-9886-c8bf8b0c1ab7)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTo test the `offerHa` variable, I created a VM using a compute offering where `offerHa=true` and the following tariff. As shown in the first screenshot above, the tariff was applied as expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"activationRule\": \"value.computeOffering.offerHa\",\r\n\"currency\": \"$\",\r\n\"effectiveDate\": \"2024-08-05T20:35:26+0000\",\r\n\"id\": \"d8826c40-2063-4ceb-b377-b05cb8b72b6e\",\r\n\"name\": \"offerHa\",\r\n\"position\": 1,\r\n\"tariffValue\": 30000,\r\n\"usageDiscriminator\": \"None\",\r\n\"usageName\": \"RUNNING_VM\",\r\n\"usageType\": 1,\r\n\"usageTypeDescription\": \"Running Vm Usage\",\r\n\"usageUnit\": \"Compute*Month\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I tested the `forceHa` variable by using the following tariff:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"activationRule\": \"configuration.forceHa\",\r\n\"currency\": \"$\",\r\n\"effectiveDate\": \"2024-08-05T19:25:17+0000\",\r\n\"id\": \"023d4562-7465-445c-afa7-cc356564ad98\",\r\n\"name\": \"forceHa\",\r\n\"position\": 1,\r\n\"tariffValue\": 22222,\r\n\"usageDiscriminator\": \"None\",\r\n\"usageName\": \"RUNNING_VM\",\r\n\"usageType\": 1,\r\n\"usageTypeDescription\": \"Running Vm Usage\",\r\n\"usageUnit\": \"Compute*Month\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the results of my tests by changing the `force.ha` values in both the cluster and global settings:\r\n\r\n| Cluster | Global settings | Tariff applied |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n|  _default_  |  _true_  | **Yes**|\r\n|  _true_  |  _false_ | **Yes**|\r\n|  _false_ |  _true_  |  **No** |\r\n|  _default_ |  _false_ |  **No**

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR supports copying a snapshot to StorPool primary storage in different zones.\r\n\r\nAdded additional API param `storageids` in CloudStack API calls:\r\n\r\n> createSnapshot\r\n> copySnapshot\r\n> createSnapshotPolicy\r\n\r\nThe option `snapshot.backup.to.secondary` does not apply to the copy functionality. The snapshots will be copied only on the required primary storage in a different zone.\r\nThe user can create volumes/templates from the copied snapshots. The option to copy the snapshots to both primary and secondary storage is available by providing in the create/copy snapshot the destination zone IDs and storage IDs\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b5f577b-2203-4fb7-8d8e-a6435e71e4fe)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78741699-430e-4365-b14c-04e7f92e3c74)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06553df8-8490-4a73-80d4-e5f23d40f733)\r\n\r\nFor other storage plugins that want to adopt this functionality:\r\n- The Primary storage driver should have the capability `CAN_COPY_SNAPSHOT_BETWEEN_ZONES`\r\n- the respective plugin needs to implement the `copySnapshot` method in their SnapshotStrategy and that the driver can handle the COPY operation\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nManual and smoke tests with StorPool primary storage on multiple zones\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-01T13:47:53Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T07:39:48Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a6845ef3f4c289487805588b799e2cae96dc489","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:ceph","name":"component:ceph","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073278,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:primary-storage","name":"component:primary-storage","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1970680557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTcwNjgwNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:orchestration","name":"component:orchestration","color":"fcabf0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35/labels","id":11418179,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4ArjpD","number":35,"title":"4.21.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":150,"closed_issues":26,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-08-08T08:47:33Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T11:58:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/4d0383783e14f8f1d507f22473ed55fdeed0b097","head":{"label":"storpool:support-snapshot-copy-on-primary","ref":"support-snapshot-copy-on-primary","sha":"4d0383783e14f8f1d507f22473ed55fdeed0b097","user":{"login":"storpool","id":10293733,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwMjkzNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10293733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool","html_url":"https://github.com/storpool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74674884,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDY3NDg4NA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"storpool/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"storpool","id":10293733,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEwMjkzNzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10293733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool","html_url":"https://github.com/storpool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/storpool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/u

Description\r\n\r\nPR #9184 attempted to optimize the `listNetworks` API by converting the multiple queries that were performed into a single one. This was done by building multiple search criterias for the individual queries, OR-adding them to an intermediary search criteria, and AND-adding the intermediary to a final one. However, this did not work as intended, because the code does not carry the joins' conditions when adding a search criteria into another one.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue, making the final query work as intended by #9184. This was done by explicitly adding the join parameters to each query's WHERE clause, which will then be included in the intermediary search criteria and in the final query. I also cleaned up the related code.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nMy environment had the following domains, accounts, projects and networks (networks beginning with an \"i\" are isolated, and with a \"s\" are shared):\r\n\r\n- ROOT: admin (root admin; networks iadmin, created sadmin), ur (user; network iur), pr (project; network ipr; has accounts admin, ur)\r\n- ROOT/d1: d1 (domain admin; networks id1, created sd1), ud1 (user; network iud1), pd1 (project; network ipd1; has account d1)\r\n- ROOT/d2: d2 (domain admin; network id2, created sd2)\r\n\r\nThrough the UI, in every account, I listed the networks using the all/account/domain/shared filters with the project toggle on/off. I compared the behavior for the same environment in a commit before #9184, and verified that it was the same. Below is a table showing which networks were listed for each account and filter combination.\r\n\r\n| Account/filter | All, project off                                    | Account, project off                 | Domain, project off  | Shared, project off         | All, project on         | Account, project on | Domain, project on | Shared, project on |\r\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\r\n| admin          | id2,iud1,id1,iur,iadmin,sd2,sd1,sadmin | id2,iud1,id1,iur,iadmin | See [1] | Empty, see [2] | ipd1,ipr,sd2,sd1,sadmin | ipd1,ipr            | See [1]            | Empty, see [2]     |\r\n| ur             | iur,sadmin                             | iur                     | See [1] | Empty, see [2] | ipr,sadmin              | ipr                 | See [1]            | Empty, see [2]     |\r\n| d1             | iud1,id1,sd1,sadmin                    | iud1,id1                | See [1] | Empty, see [2] | ipd1,sd1,sadmin         | ipd1                | See [1]            | Empty, see [2]     |\r\n| ud1            | iud1,sd1,sadmin                        | iud1                    | See [1] | Empty, see [2] | sd1,sadmin              | Empty               | See [1]            | Empty, see [2]     |\r\n| d2             | id2,sd2,sadmin                         | id2                     | See [1] | Empty, see [2] | sd2,sadmin              | Empty               | See [1]            | Empty, see [2]     |\r\n\r\n[1] When filtering by domain, I got `Invalid value of networkfilter: domainpath`. This was already present before #9184.\r\n[2] This is probably not the intended behavior, and was already present before #9184. It can be fixed in a separate PR, as this one only aims to restore the original filtering

is a simple NAS backup plugin for KVM which may be later expanded for other hypervisors. This backup plugin aims to use shared NAS storage on KVM hosts such as NFS (or CephFS and others in future), which is used to backup fully cloned VMs for backup & restore operations. This may NOT be as efficient and performant as some of the other B&R providers, but maybe useful for some KVM environments who are okay to only have full-instance backups and limited functionality.\r\n\r\nDesign & Implementation follows the `networker` B&R plugin, which is simply:\r\n\r\n- Implement B&R plugin interfaces\r\n- Use cmd-answer pattern to execute backup and restore operations on KVM host when VM is running (or needs to be restored) - instead of a B&R API client, relies on answers from KVM agent which executes the operations\r\n- Backups are full VM domain snapshots, copied to a VM-specific folders on a NAS target (NFS) along with a domain XML\r\n- Backup uses libvirt feature: https://libvirt.org/kbase/live_full_disk_backup.html orchestrated via virsh/bash script (nasbackup.sh) as the libvirt-java lacks the bindings\r\n- Supported instance volume storage for restore operations: NFS & local storage\r\n\r\nRefer the doc PR for feature limitations and usage details:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/429\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n\r\nEach backup offering map to a Backup repository that takes in backup storage

Description\r\n\r\nUsing XenServer as the hypervisor, when deleting a snapshot that has a parent, that parent will also get erased on storage, causing data loss. This behavior was introduced with #7873, where the list of snapshot states that can be deleted was changed to add `BackedUp` snapshots. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the states list back to the original list, and swaps the while loop for a do while loop to account for the changes in #7873.\r\n\r\nFixes #9446 \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [X] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [X] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. Created a VM\r\n2. Took a volume snapshot (S1).\r\n3. Accessed the VM and wrote some data with: `dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1M count=1000`\r\n4. Used `sync` to make sure data is written to disk\r\n5. Took a second volume snapshot (S2).\r\n6. Deleted the last volume snapshot (S2).\r\n\r\nBefore the change, S1 would be mistakenly deleted from storage as well, and an inconsistent snapshot record would remain.\r\nAfter the change, S1 is untouched and works as intended.","created_at":"2024-07-25T17:19:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T06:01:25Z","closed_at":"2024-08-01T12:03:04Z","merged_at":"2024-08-01T12:03:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"9033ab709e6fad4ac9300649214d7e2ba938b020","assignee":{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592953226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI5NTMyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:BLOCKER","name":"Severity:BLOCKER","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33/labels","id":11200547,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4Aqugj","number":33,"title":"4.19.2","description":"minor

PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/422\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows creating shared networks with Security Groups in a Zone with securitygroupenabled set to false. This flag is used to prevent creation of isolated networks as of now to maintain backward compatibility for Zone with Security Groups.\r\n\r\nTo enable SG, enable the SecurityGroupProvider for Guest physical network.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the building blocks for Dynamic Routing support in CloudStack by introducing BGP AS Numbers into CloudStack. The Dynamic Routing support for CloudStack will be implemented in a separate PR (by @weizhouapache) and it will use this PR to consume the AS Numbers.\r\n\r\nDesign Document: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/BGP+AS+Numbers+Management\r\n\r\nThe following use cases are introduced:\r\n- Administrators can define AS Number ranges at the zone level\r\n- Administrators can create network offerings choosing between Static and Dynamic Routing Mode.\r\n   - When Dynamic Routing Mode is selected: the Specify AS Number option can be enabled (false by default)\r\n- Administrators can create VPC offerings choosing between Static and Dynamic Routing Mode.\r\n   - When Dynamic Routing Mode is selected: the Specify AS Number option can be enabled (false by default)\r\n- Networks (non VPC tiers) created from offerings supporting Dynamic Routing Mode will acquire an AS Number:\r\n   - When Specify AS Number is set to false on the network offering: CloudStack assigns a free random AS Number from the AS Number range to the network.\r\n   - When Specify AS Number is set to true on the network offering: operators can select a free AS Number from the AS Number range.\r\n- VPCs created from VPC offerings supporting Dynamic Routing Mode will acquire an AS Number:\r\n   - When Specify AS Number is set to false on the VPC offering: CloudStack assigns a free random AS Number from the AS Number range to the VPC.\r\n   - When Specify AS Number is set to true on the VPC offering: operators can select a free AS Number from the AS Number range to the VPC.\r\n   - Every network tier on the VPC will inherit the AS Number from the VPC\r\n- Administrators can list AS Numbers by: zone, network, VPC, account, domain and allocation state\r\n- Administrators can release an AS Number from a network or a VPC\r\n   - If the VPC or Network Offering has Specify AS Number set to true, then the AS Number cannot be released (releasing is performed on the VPC/network deletion)\r\n- When removing a network or a VPC that has acquired an AS Number, CloudStack releases the AS Number before removing the network or VPC\r\n\r\n### Types of

Tested?\r\n\r\n- Added AS Number Range to a zone\r\n- Created 2 Network Offerings selecting Routing Mode = Dynamic:\r\n   - Specify AS = false\r\n   - Specify AS = true\r\n- Created 2 VPC Offerings selecting Routing Mode = Dynamic:\r\n   - Specify AS = false\r\n   - Specify AS = true\r\n- Created VPCs and networks selecting the offerings above\r\n- Verify releasing AS Numbers and delete network/VPCs\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read

Description\r\n\r\nBased on the comment https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/9385#issuecomment-2227061721 from @DaanHoogland, and considering that all the DB view definitions are currently refactored out of the DB upgrade schema sql scripts, I took the liberty to delete most of the remaining unused view definitions on these scripts, as they are overwritten in the end of the DB upgrade workflow.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested resetting the database to the 4.0.0 version via the management script cloudstack-setup-databases. After the database reset, the management server was also reset to ensure it ran all upgrade scripts.\r\n\r\nOnce the reset process was completed, various API operations were tested, particularly those that use database views to build their responses. Verifying the behavior was the same after the changes. During these tests, normal behavior was consistently observed. All API operations performed as expected, with no errors encountered.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the log stream was monitored throughout the testing phase to detect any potential issues or anomalies. The logs remained clear, showing no errors or warnings related to the current refactor.","created_at":"2024-07-16T16:32:17Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T15:08:42Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f32011a98048d58896be83159ac86767a0d85e7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vladimirpetrov","id":12384665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12384665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirpetrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/b5a8602e39778edfdd1a8e6976b5373a21f5ebca","head":{"label":"scclouds:refactoring-db-upgrade-views","ref":"refactoring-db-upgrade-views","sha":"b5a8602e39778edfdd1a8e6976b5373a21f5ebca","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThe metrics for VMs and VM disks in CloudStack depend on the hypervisor plugin used for each hypervisor. The behavior can vary across different hypervisors. For VMware, metrics are retrieved as average value for the time interval defined in the global configuration - vmware.stats.time.window.\r\n\r\nRelated documentation PR:

Description\r\n\r\nThe class `VolumeVO` lacks access modifiers in its fields. This PR aims to improve adherence to object-oriented programming by adding private access modifiers to all fields in the class mentioned above, along with their respective getters and setters. I've also added a getter to an occurrence in `VolumeApiServiceImpl` where a field belonging to `VolumeVO` was being accessed directly.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI ran all the tests related to `VolumeVO` and `VolumeApiServiceImpl`, checked all usages of both classes, and made sure nothing was broken.","created_at":"2024-07-15T11:04:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T07:51:59Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T07:51:43Z","merged_at":"2024-12-06T07:51:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"810c4108c7b87e740c53e83ed5b5f54842e13598","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/36","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/36","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/36/labels","id":11531641,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4Ar_V5","number":36,"title":"4.20.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":54,"closed_issues":48,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-09-03T08:11:34Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T14:31:15Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/67dbfe3f8cb0dd7c1bd16888b93c0401e98111ba","head":{"label":"scclouds:add-access-modifiers-to-VolumeVO","ref":"add-access-modifiers-to-VolumeVO","sha":"67dbfe3f8cb0dd7c1bd16888b93c0401e98111ba","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache
