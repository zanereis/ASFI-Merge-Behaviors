I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1925\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nBug fix for distinct events that attempt a lease when a valid one already exists in the database. We want to remember the distinct event time, not the current database time because the current database time may be within epsilon of the existing trigger, so when we revisit the event it may be considered not unique and the trigger is lost. \r\n\r\nChange debug statements to info temporarily to debug reminder events being set with a trigger timestamp that is sometimes _newer_ than `dbEventTimestamp` running into this constraint [violation](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/809ccd62b3a92c1d484636e6ec67d78de4043806/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/runtime/api/MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter.java#L259). Additionally, some portion of reminder events are being set to a trigger that is different than the one in db that another participant acquired and finished the lease for. Need to determine why this is happening. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1927\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n* Topic validation is used for validating topic and skipping the bad ones during work unite creation. This PR introduces a generic validation layer to support plugging in topic validator, to validate topic names, bad schema evolution, etc.\r\n* More details in this PR:\r\n  * Add the topic validation support in `KafkaSource`\r\n  * Add the first validator `TopicNameValidator` into the validator chain, as a refactor of existing codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Added `TopicValidatorsTest`\r\n- Enhanced `KafkaSourceTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-04T18:47:19Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T21:46:45Z","closed_at":"2023-10-18T21:46:45Z","merged_at":"2023-10-18T21:46:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"6266a12c29c464f64d69cbed5c0fce9b0121870e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c4b0d353ae0c6570c85328e15f9895c102861968","head":{"label":"wsarecv:tqin/validator","ref":"tqin/validator","sha":"c4b0d353ae0c6570c85328e15f9895c102861968","user":{"login":"wsarecv","id":35046097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDQ2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35046097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv","html_url":"https://github.com/wsarecv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":623188101,"node_id":"R_kgDOJSUYhQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"wsarecv/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wsarecv","id":35046097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDQ2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35046097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv","html_url":"https://github.com/wsarecv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wsarecv/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1923\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd retention to lease arbiter table so it does not grow unbounded. The table can be as large as O(number of flows) which may grow so large that reading/writing from this table becomes time consuming and slows down our throughput of obtaining and evaluating leases for launching flows. \r\n\r\n- Remove default values from lease arbiter table (left off on previous PR)\r\n- Increase default for scheduler max backoff to include more jitter between participants holding a reminder. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-03T22:35:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T20:22:46Z","closed_at":"2023-10-06T20:22:46Z","merged_at":"2023-10-06T20:22:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ae7c0bf149061ad7a762f21355091c9dc1aae64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3792/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3792/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3792/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ab2b0deebd31fbdc9550610b1851b83afbc55196","head":{"label":"umustafi:leaseArbiterTableRetention","ref":"leaseArbiterTableRetention","sha":"ab2b0deebd31fbdc9550610b1851b83afbc55196","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1921\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nReminder flow trigger events were being improperly handled and interpreted as new events because they are triggered linger time after the original trigger where epsilon < linger and we use epsilon to determine event distinctness. With reminder events being considered distinct events, we were launching excess concurrent flows that were then being cancelled. Now we handle reminder events differently from normal event triggers to ensure they're properly evaluated. Because of db laundering, reminder events are easy to handle - if they're older than the currently worked upon event in the database they can be skipped and if they're equal to the current event in the database they are handled like normal. Reminder events should never be newer than the current event in the lease arbiter table because db laundering always results in increasing event times. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdates existing unit tests \r\nTODO: adding tests to handle reminder events \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-02T17:49:25Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T18:50:56Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T18:50:55Z","merged_at":"2023-10-03T18:50:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a2edfcb40c656c74865f58390d0eb64fb835f1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3790/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3790/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3790/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8648d342abb56f27358a0304d563af7d98c3c874","head":{"label":"umustafi:properlyHandleReminderEvents","ref":"properlyHandleReminderEvents","sha":"8648d342abb56f27358a0304d563af7d98c3c874","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1918\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe GobblinOrcWriter contains a converter and a buffer rowbatch. The buffer holds the converted Avro -> Orc records before adding them to the native orc writer.\r\n\r\nSince it can contain multiple records, it constantly needs to resize the columns of the rowbatch in order to hold multiple records. This problem affects both performance and memory when resizing is done either too often (enlarge factor is too low) or not often enough (enlarge factor is too high and thus the buffer dominates the container memory).\r\n\r\nBecause there is a bounded number of records that can persist in the buffer before getting flushed, we want to reduce the aggressiveness of the resizing algorithm the more records that have been processed.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes changing the smart resizing algorithm to be an **exponential decay algorithm**, where it is bounded between some max and a min. Given the default values, it will converge to the min at around ~500 records. \r\n\r\nThe logic here is that after a rowbatch is saturated, it is very unlikely that it needs to be resized significantly, otherwise a record with large arrays can cause the rowbatch to grow out of bounds and cause OOM. So when the row batch approaches saturation, we want to decrease the amount we are resizing by.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nParallel pipeline and unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1915] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1915\r\n\r\n- Replaced [Apache Helix task framework](https://helix.apache.org/1.3.0-docs/tutorial_task_framework.html) in Gobblin with [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n- Copied contents of Helix and Yarn Java classes to analogous Temporal classes to avoid affecting any current use-cases\r\n- Core implementation of these new classes no longer depends on Helix\r\n- Proof of concept implementation prints \"Hello Gobblin!\" by connecting to a specified Temporal cluster, namespace, and task queue.\r\n- Uses existing yarn `ApplicationMaster` and `TaskRunner` code leveraged within Kafka streaming (AKA Fast ingest) to provide compute to temporal\r\n\r\nThe goal of introducing Temporal is to bring the following benefits:\r\n1. Developer Experience\r\n- Exception stack traces\r\n- Workflow / Job status\r\n- Live stacktrace (No need for jstack)\r\n- Clean interfaces for programming with less boiler plate\r\n- Guarantees for task completion and retries given adequate compute\r\n2. Scalability\r\n- Max containers per cluster scales horizontally with Temporal frontend servers\r\n- MySQL >> ZK write throughput \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe following code \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/91f105f8-7159-46a3-8840-5cb125ba75e0)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    4. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    5. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    6. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    7. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\nAttached Below are some diagrams explaining how Helix currently works within Gobblin and Temporal is being used within Gobblin\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/23def004-bedf-4105-8f54-47e4970a1169)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/2afaec1d-172b-4790-8beb-6b7788cf2c26)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/4cbc96c2-aa52-4d6d-96bc-b6131a0434e0)\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-21T17:17:27Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T16:56:32Z","closed_at":"2023-09-22T16:56:31Z","merged_at":"2023-09-22T16:56:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"c98ef9d475bdc8966b0ce72b7a79679db153fdf8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3785/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3785/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3785/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ba1c6d11cde187b6f05e1c97e37f9f999f75d4d1","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-temporal-GOBBLIN-1915","ref":"mh-temporal-GOBBLIN-1915","sha":"ba1c6d11cde187b6f05e1c97e37f9f999f75d4d1","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1916\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIncluding `flow execution id` as a part of multi-active lease arbitration for `LAUNCH` events is frequently causing the same trigger on multiple hosts to be perceived as unique flow executions since the `flow execution id` reflects the system clock of the participant. For a single flow trigger, there may be up to N flow execution ids where N is the number of active participants. The same flow action is perceived as unique from the other ones and excess flows are launched concurrently (upon which the additional ones are cancelled). Remove all use of the flow execution id for the `LAUNCH` case right now. In the future, we will generalize the arbiter for other flow actions when we determine the value they will require for arbitration. \r\n\r\n_Note:_ **This change prevents concurrent launches but allows concurrent executions** for the same flow group and flow name. We consolidate _flow launches_ (not executions themselves) that are within epsilon (on the order of a few seconds) as they are not considered unique, but this doesn't limit multiple flows from running at same time. If we complete the launch and one flow is running, we can still launch another.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan the `MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiterTest` unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-21T16:40:07Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T17:17:16Z","closed_at":"2023-09-21T17:17:16Z","merged_at":"2023-09-21T17:17:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc73db8b3feb0fb70a6bfde983646eecaf826ef4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/74ac8ab3098ad7b516beb5aa69a393b999b1a325","head":{"label":"umustafi:removeFlowExecutionIdFromMALeaseArbitration","ref":"removeFlowExecutionIdFromMALeaseArbitration","sha":"74ac8ab3098ad7b516beb5aa69a393b999b1a325","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

This PR is only handling the cases for adhoc REST client calls for launch, resume and kill/cancel flows. Currently, this PR is only providing a template for the end-to-end functionality and implementing some parts of existing DagManager's responsibility. There will be subsequent PRs to implement functionalities that are missing likewise scheduler triggers via orchestrator, advancing to the next set of nodes in a Dag, cleaning up of Dags etc.\r\n\r\nThe method signatures, instantiations and return types use widely accepted and default values, but will be restricted once responsibility/functionality of each class is determined.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1909\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGithub Actions CI fails consistently with this error:\r\n```\r\nGradle suite > Gradle test > org.apache.gobblin.runtime.StateStoreWatermarkStorageTest > testPersistWatermarkStateToZk FAILED\r\n    java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to create ZkStateStore with factory\r\n        at org.apache.gobblin.metastore.ZkStateStoreFactory.createStateStore(ZkStateStoreFactory.java:39)\r\n        at org.apache.gobblin.runtime.StateStoreBasedWatermarkStorage.<init>(StateStoreBasedWatermarkStorage.java:107)\r\n        at org.apache.gobblin.runtime.StateStoreWatermarkStorageTest.testPersistWatermarkStateToZk(StateStoreWatermarkStorageTest.java:65)\r\n\r\n        Caused by:\r\n        org.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.exception.ZkTimeoutException: Unable to connect to zookeeper server within timeout: 60000 \r\n```\r\nGiven that this test seems to be an infra issue on the test runners, will be disabling this test on CI for now. The long term solution is to find a container for the GA runner to load up on start time, similar to how it handles mysql.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1911\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- We updated the Salesforce high watermark query to use MAX aggregate function instead of order by with limit 1 as part of https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3750.\r\n- When there are no modified records, this query returns an empty row, compared to no rows with the previous query.\r\n- This is resulting in NPE while trying to parse the high watermark value.\r\n- Adding checks on the objects to prevent the NPE as part of this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Added UTs to cover for the potential cases where empty response is returned for the high watermark query\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-14T16:48:26Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T03:14:46Z","closed_at":"2023-09-15T03:14:46Z","merged_at":"2023-09-15T03:14:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba7ec85341f9dec119b2a62f183c714965b906aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/aa7c86986fadf1e9f4a4de45852aff02ba2f8b29","head":{"label":"gautamguptabasant:highwtm-query-no-records-npe-fix","ref":"highwtm-query-no-records-npe-fix","sha":"aa7c86986fadf1e9f4a4de45852aff02ba2f8b29","user":{"login":"gautamguptabasant","id":8106133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":683127917,"node_id":"R_kgDOKLe0bQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"gautamguptabasant/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gautamguptabasant","id":8106133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1908\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe had previously assumed the `Date` object returned from a `Trigger` uses the system default timezone, but taking a look at the javadoc and runtime values have shown it is already in UTC so we update our conversion function. To prevent further confusion about timezones, we also log the conversion that assumes the `Date` object is in system default timezone to make it easier to debug. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-14T00:21:23Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T00:34:30Z","closed_at":"2023-09-15T00:34:30Z","merged_at":"2023-09-15T00:34:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"2600fa60691156eec6881ecc6db140fa4c49bb92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7a9378142e44bbdd0d09c1e4247f3cdf81384744","head":{"label":"umustafi:schedulerTracingTimestampAdjustment","ref":"schedulerTracingTimestampAdjustment","sha":"7a9378142e44bbdd0d09c1e4247f3cdf81384744","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1907\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen other participants complete a lease (not just acquire it) in the time that the current participant has attempted the lease, we will see a NULL `lease_acquisition_timestamp` and should appropriately handle the resulting value. This case was missed and we were only expecting another participant to have acquired the lease. \r\nWe also add warning logs for `JobExceptions` that can be hiding the stack trace of errors encountered in runtime. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested behavior without change to see NPE and after updates the tests pass without any exceptions \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-13T22:23:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T00:12:29Z","closed_at":"2023-09-14T00:12:29Z","merged_at":"2023-09-14T00:12:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d600b52dd20c21cf26203d0852613db655fb7e96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/22c668729da90df45a06d9f942ef04400863d5d0","head":{"label":"umustafi:addressSchedulerNPE","ref":"addressSchedulerNPE","sha":"22c668729da90df45a06d9f942ef04400863d5d0","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1906\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nA customer reported seeing:\r\n```\r\nError: java.io.IOException: Task failed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The value of property <<redacted>> must not be null\r\n  at com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkArgument(Preconditions.java:146)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.set(Configuration.java:1260)\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.set(Configuration.java:1241)\r\n  at org.apache.gobblin.util.JobConfigurationUtils.putStateIntoConfiguration(JobConfigurationUtils.java:95)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nthe appears to arise from concurrent modification to the `State`'s underlying `Properties` (i.e. between the time the `keySet()` is first read and when each value is accessed from the same `Properties`).\r\n\r\nalthough the customer's impl seems to warrant synchronization, given that a null-value is certain to be rejected by `o.a.hadoop.conf.Configuration`, defensively filter those out ahead of time.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nno current unit tests for this small utility method\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-13T20:24:04Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T20:27:13Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T20:27:13Z","merged_at":"2023-09-18T20:27:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"a28961370ffbd41e740b9e6b9238b1c9d91ae6ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f78cd9e4fd73408035565ef6a2cc6b4b90ee0a16","head":{"label":"phet:null-check-for_putStateIntoConfiguration","ref":"null-check-for_putStateIntoConfiguration","sha":"f78cd9e4fd73408035565ef6a2cc6b4b90ee0a16","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

underestimate in memory\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1905\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFixes a bug that causes the ORC Writer self tune to underestimate the native ORC writer memory, leading to potential OOM issues.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in the scenario where the writer would close before ever tuning itself and measuring the native ORC writer buffer. \r\n\r\nDuring close, the native ORC writer would flush itself - emptying its buffers and leading to the memory estimate to be extremely minimal, then record its memory estimate in the saved state if it has not recorded an estimate before. So for datasets that write a small number of records to file it would greatly underestimate the memory within the native ORC writer.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-13T04:14:20Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T20:36:33Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T20:36:33Z","merged_at":"2023-09-13T20:36:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6f546e91f16d72d66c12182d86b416d54a8db83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b2518379344478933cb20b1f6e082b7e8053ddad","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-bug-native-orc-writer-estimation","ref":"fix-bug-native-orc-writer-estimation","sha":"b2518379344478933cb20b1f6e082b7e8053ddad","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1904\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- In the current form, it's very difficult to add tests for changes as we need to handle all sorts of calls.\r\nMoved the code related to histogram calculation to a new class - SalesforceHistogramService. This allows us to mock all that happens in this class, making writing tests easy.\r\n- Added a test for the new change introduced as part of https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3766\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Added a test for the new change introduced as part of https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3766\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-13T01:46:47Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T12:12:52Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T03:59:24Z","merged_at":"2023-09-13T03:59:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"16389dc751cebb985c75faf97b35dd6f51c13653","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/172060dacea0493f15cc19f8e3c77fa83ba5c6fb","head":{"label":"gautamguptabasant:master","ref":"master","sha":"172060dacea0493f15cc19f8e3c77fa83ba5c6fb","user":{"login":"gautamguptabasant","id":8106133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":683127917,"node_id":"R_kgDOKLe0bQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"gautamguptabasant/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gautamguptabasant","id":8106133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1903\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- As per the current implementation, early stop is enabled only when multi-partition is also configured. \r\n- As part of this change, we are enabling the support for single partition configuration as well.\r\n- FYI, early stop is a way to limit the number of records that are fetched/ingested from the CRM source. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- The current organization of the SalesforceSource class makes it super hard to add tests. Hence not adding tests as part of this tiny change. \r\n- Taking up refactoring of the class as an immediate follow up item, where I will be moving the histogram related code to a new service class. Doing so, we would be able to mock those methods and hence easily write tests for the logic in this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-12T13:27:32Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T23:26:15Z","closed_at":"2023-09-12T23:26:14Z","merged_at":"2023-09-12T23:26:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"aee82dd2fc6a8153add7c3271705d008b27bd797","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3766/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3766/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3766/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7f8930d89c23486d593293b504c645a4fe84d17f","head":{"label":"gautamguptabasant:early-top-single-partition","ref":"early-top-single-partition","sha":"7f8930d89c23486d593293b504c645a4fe84d17f","user":{"login":"gautamguptabasant","id":8106133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":683127917,"node_id":"R_kgDOKLe0bQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"gautamguptabasant/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gautamguptabasant","id":8106133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDYxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8106133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant","html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gautamguptabasant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gautamguptabasant/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1901 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCreates MysqlMultiActiveLeaseAribterTestingDecorator class used to model scenarios where a lease owner fails to complete a lease successfully intermittently (representing a variety of slowness or failure cases that can result on the participant side, network connectivity, or database).\r\nIt will fail on calls to {@link MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter.recordLeaseSuccess()} where a deterministic function of the lease obtained timestamp matches a bitmask of the host. Ideally, each participant should fail on different calls (with limited overlap if we want to test that). See java doc for more details. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nWIP (will add in second iteration once methodology is agreed upon)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-09T00:19:15Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T02:13:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53f2fd6cde13322a49871a9d91ed8bb7f12c8ceb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/43eae5f37a29ac670abb6b18d9240045a5bc3ab5","head":{"label":"umustafi:leaseArbiterDecorator","ref":"leaseArbiterDecorator","sha":"43eae5f37a29ac670abb6b18d9240045a5bc3ab5","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1900\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nMapReduce is an aging legacy technology, so it's worth exploring additional execution frameworks.  To simplify experimentation and evaluation, add the ability to \"borrow\" MR's WorkUnit preparation, so such forays may at first jump ahead to investigate WU execution.\r\n\r\nThe option `mr.persist.workunits.then.cancel` works as advertised.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nsuccessful manual testing\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-07T16:21:29Z","updated_at":"2023-09-08T17:46:39Z","closed_at":"2023-09-08T17:46:38Z","merged_at":"2023-09-08T17:46:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8444fa2f41c2c13e79bd993d0fd7da471b3fa7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b6035b5b770ad7d83ec06cea507d164c99175d5a","head":{"label":"phet:add-mr-persist-workunits-then-cancel","ref":"add-mr-persist-workunits-then-cancel","sha":"b6035b5b770ad7d83ec06cea507d164c99175d5a","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1899] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1899\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNothing crazy here. I had concerns about the current behavior of the clusters names properties that is used to add the `clusterIdentifier` for GMCE and GTE. \r\n\r\nInternally we use non scheme in the properties with a port and it wasn't clear whether or not this code was working as expected. I've added these unit tests to both check this behavior and maintain this behavior going forward.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/bd385b1e-fc6c-46db-bde3-850bd0f2d5a2)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1898\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe ORCWriter's new self tuning feature leads to slower write frequency when it comes to ingesting datasets with a low volume of records.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily caused by the assumption that the native ORC writer will be saturated, which leads to the memory footprint of STRIPE_SIZE + avgSizeOfRecord*rowsBetweenMemoryCheck.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is generally not the case when there are only a few records to write due to a low volume dataset, and causes slow writes. We should utilize a newer API on ORCWriter brought in by https://github.com/apache/orc/pull/1057\r\n\r\nSome other improvements so that memory consumption by the writer is fluctuates less:\r\n1. Persist more state in between writers so that writers will start at a more reasonable base point based off the past\r\n2. When increasing batchSize, raise it by a percentage of the error (proportional control) so that batchsize leads to less overshoot in memory usage\r\n3. Reveal more configuration knobs to manually tune the limits of the self tuning writer\r\n\r\nBumps ORC Version from 1.6.8 to 1.7.4\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1896\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nThere is a scenario where an audit map returned from Kafka Audit URL is not empty, as when there are counts in at least one of the Kafka tiers. However, it is possible that all or some of the source tiers and all or some of the reference tiers have 0 count. If there is a comparison of two counts where the source tier is 0 and the reference tier is also 0, it will result in a 0/0 calculation when calculating the percentage completeness and this evaluates to NaN (not a number). In this scenario as the determined percentage is NaN, the completeness check for that type of completeness will be returned as false and thus, the watermark will not progress for that hour.\r\n\r\nFix: \r\nIf the source tier reports 0 and the corresponding reference tier also reports 0, the completeness for that hour can be marked as complete as no records were expected and no records were consumed. Thus, the completeness check for the completeness type for that hour can be marked as true and the watermark can be updated and moved forward.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdds in the test scenario of when source tier count is 0 and reference tier count is also 0. The expected result is that the completeness check will return true.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nKafka source is commonly used to ETL from Kafka to HDFS as part of Fast Ingest. This data is later exposed via Hive / Iceberg to be queried via Spark / Trino. Hive does not support `.` to be part of the table name. This means that in order to keep consistency between Hive and Kafka names, it requires some conversion. \r\n\r\nThis is a high toil and low reward process. It would be great to have a flag to just outright ignore these topics altogether. Especially if the Gobblin operator does not control who creates Kafka topics. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n<img width=\"394\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/8d2c95ad-d6da-426d-ba35-ee1f0eca1a45\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-01T18:44:12Z","updated_at":"2023-09-02T00:07:52Z","closed_at":"2023-09-02T00:07:51Z","merged_at":"2023-09-02T00:07:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"22e984ba7afd0b144a599725b4fb0a19cb718bde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/267caf39de170089610e733f1a8540f62d83d0bc","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-period-in-kafka-topic-GOBBLIN-1894","ref":"mh-period-in-kafka-topic-GOBBLIN-1894","sha":"267caf39de170089610e733f1a8540f62d83d0bc","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\nThe idea is make `DagManager` less bulky and break it into submodules which will share it responsibilities. This is one step towards achieving the statelessness in `DagManager` when we want to operate in a multi-active (multiple DagManager leaders) mode\r\nUsing this PR as a reference only. Will create subsequent PRs with actual implementation.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T16:38:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T13:55:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/24a77c9905debe4efae57c39fa50500ab05fa611","head":{"label":"meethngala:refactor-dag-manager-to-make-it-less-bulky","ref":"refactor-dag-manager-to-make-it-less-bulky","sha":"24a77c9905debe4efae57c39fa50500ab05fa611","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1892\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- We run into issues when we try to update acl entries for existing paths. Previously, used `setAcl`API provided by `hadoop.fs`, but it requires all 3 Acl entry types: `user, group and others` to be always present, which might not be case when fetching acl entries. Thus, `modifyEntries` should be used since it will either update existing Acls or set Acls if missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- modified unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-30T00:58:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T21:52:46Z","closed_at":"2023-09-05T21:52:46Z","merged_at":"2023-09-05T21:52:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4a9966da33b69a6e95d308fc7beb105452b0bdb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9486b5a60519dde146a047f8b61ea9efc4092652","head":{"label":"meethngala:add-others-acl-entry-type-if-absent-while-preserving-acls","ref":"add-others-acl-entry-type-if-absent-while-preserving-acls","sha":"9486b5a60519dde146a047f8b61ea9efc4092652","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1890] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1890\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIt's possible for GMIP to support processing GMCEs that correspond to records from different kafka brokers. This can be done by passing in extra information as a prefix to the offset range map. However, we must also update the algorithm for fetching the topic name to allow for a prefix.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following offset range keys should be valid and all parse to the `topicname`\r\n- `topicname-0`\r\n- `kafkaBroker1.topicname-0`\r\n- `colocation-kafkabroker1.topicname-0`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/253c5cef-fe52-42d4-bd72-20c962b462aa)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-29T00:59:34Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T22:55:25Z","closed_at":"2023-08-29T22:55:25Z","merged_at":"2023-08-29T22:55:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ab094a4277b92e17c46b3722b603daaf126d022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/49261bc65030f866fceed0ff2b28832d0609d4c9","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-offset-range-writer-GOBBLIN-1890","ref":"mh-offset-range-writer-GOBBLIN-1890","sha":"49261bc65030f866fceed0ff2b28832d0609d4c9","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1891\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe current ORCWriter which converts Avro to ORC frequently runs into OOM issues on large schemas. This is theorized to be partially due to the way that the converter allocates memory for large lists and maps, it uses a resize algorithm that multiplies the last array size by 3. This can lead to a lot of extra space, along with the large records already stored within the buffer and the file writer, will cause memory issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a few components/ideas to manage memory:\r\n1. Have the converter also estimate the size of each record since it needs to traverse through the record in order to perform the conversion.\r\n2. The internal buffer of the `GobblinBaseOrcWriter` should account for the memory available in the JVM (which is available through the Java runtime APIs) minus the size of the records that can be stored in the underlying file writer and the size of the Avro to ORC converter due to resizes. It should then divide this number by the average size of a record\r\n3. There was a conscious decision to not re-initialize the underlying ORCWriter every time a tune is performed because it would have to create a new file which can lead to a large number of files in the end. Since there is a compression done when rows are added to this writer, it should generally perform well enough* if it is tuned during each writer initialization at the beginning, in Fast Ingest this occurs every 5 minutes\r\n4. Average record size and the size allocated to the converter is stored in the Gobblin state and every writer initialization will use the previous run's calculations instead of slowly tuning up.\r\n\r\nFuture work/ Improvements around this:\r\n1. Expose more knobs around configurability once we can benchmark performance.\r\n2. Refactor all the resizing of the converter buffer into the memory manager, then implement a fix for `smartResize` algorithm which should effectively be a bounded exponential decay function, so that records that are marginally larger than the previous calculated records do not cause the converter to balloon out of control. This should improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests around memory manager\r\nTested with Kafka ingestion pipelines\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    4. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-25T17:55:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T21:02:53Z","closed_at":"2023-09-01T21:02:52Z","merged_at":"2023-09-01T21:02:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0787aaf6f0c7b4306a799df4a9a4c76ce19e5db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3751/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3751/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3751/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0a637eb7a0d0e859ce3f4aa00cd304205930fc86","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:create-selftuning-orc-writer","ref":"create-selftuning-orc-writer","sha":"0a637eb7a0d0e859ce3f4aa00cd304205930fc86","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1888\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- The current query for fetching high watermark metadata does a sort and then picks the top row, which times out for very large datasets.\r\n- MAX based query should perform better\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Added tests for the get high watermark metadata method, where the changes are done.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1887 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIncrease abstraction and encapsulation in `FlowTriggerHandler` with minor refactoring to static helper functions. Unpack objects as late as possible to make `scheduleReminderForEvent` easier to read. Add unit tests for each of the static helper functions. \r\nBug fix 1: Ensure that the `reminderJobKey` is also used as the `reminderTrigger's` key\r\nBug fix 2: Utilize the `jobProps` to determine `triggerEventTimeMillis` for reminder events\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- testCreateSuffixForJobTrigger\r\n- testConstructReminderJobKey\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-24T23:55:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T17:57:05Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T17:57:05Z","merged_at":"2023-08-28T17:57:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6368a2110dd662ea9d6cdcac04db00ab6318d30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d271f38a885e6fe28523e9b53dc64d76c768b75f","head":{"label":"umustafi:unitTestsForReminderEvent","ref":"unitTestsForReminderEvent","sha":"d271f38a885e6fe28523e9b53dc64d76c768b75f","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1886] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1886\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWho knows what changed between these versions. 1.0.3 release notes don't exist but here are the [1.0.4 ones ](https://helix.apache.org/1.0.4-docs/releasenotes/release-1.0.4.html)🤣 \r\n\r\nThe main thing that seems important is ZK client version bumped from 3.4.9 to 3.6.3, which means the default ZK client version will have a client side jute max buffer decreased from 4MB to 1MB. Within LinkedIn, we addressed this by overriding with the following java arg. This client buffer will be exceeded if a znode exceeds ~8k children. This will occur within Gobblin if your Gobblin jobs are particularly large and you are using Zookeeper as your watermark state store. NOTE: if you were using zookeeper as your state store at this scale, you will see many other scaling issues. Some of which  need to be fixed with just more ZK observers, a beefier ZK cluster, or more Helix controllers.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n-Djute.maxbuffer=4194304\r\n```\r\n\r\n>Bug Fixes\r\n> Fixed size history for Scheduled Workflow tasks (#2036)\r\n> fix bug where generateJobList would iterate until the parallelism is reached #2065\r\n> Fixed website deployment and bump up corresponding dependencies\r\n> Do not proceed with cluster creation if addCluster() fails.

It should be caught at compile time and via unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-22T01:20:10Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T00:18:21Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T00:18:21Z","merged_at":"2023-08-24T00:18:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"90380fc4bcf5db13c306d2ac3b49b613d84830b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/49223ea4960ab5fb6988040ddd3067f2ccfb3dca","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-upgrade-helix-GOBBLIN-1886","ref":"mh-upgrade-helix-GOBBLIN-1886","sha":"49223ea4960ab5fb6988040ddd3067f2ccfb3dca","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1884\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere is a bug in which launch actions get accumulated and \"stuck\" in the dag action store, so every time a leader is changed or the service is re-deployed we will keep redoing old launch actions again and again. \r\n*Also includes a few refactoring improvements to the `FlowTriggerHandler` to make it more readable and ensure the right `JobKey` when adding trigger reminders to the `Scheduler`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1881 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe following error is thrown when attempting to schedule reminder events. \r\n```\r\n{{The job ... referenced by the trigger does not exist.\",\"stackTrace\":[\r\n{\"index\":0,\"call\":\"storeTrigger\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"RAMJobStore.java\",\"lineNumber\":422,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.quartz.simpl.RAMJobStore\"}\r\n,\r\n{\"index\":1,\"call\":\"scheduleJob\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"QuartzScheduler.java\",\"lineNumber\":932,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.quartz.core.QuartzScheduler\"}\r\n,\r\n{\"index\":2,\"call\":\"scheduleJob\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"StdScheduler.java\",\"lineNumber\":258,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.quartz.impl.StdScheduler\"}\r\n,\r\n{\"index\":3,\"call\":\"scheduleReminderForEvent\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"FlowTriggerHandler.java\",\"lineNumber\":187,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.apache.gobblin.service.modules.orchestration.FlowTriggerHandler\"}\r\n,\r\n{\"index\":4,\"call\":\"handleTriggerEvent\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"FlowTriggerHandler.java\",\"lineNumber\":124,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.apache.gobblin.service.modules.orchestration.FlowTriggerHandler\"}\r\n,\r\n{\"index\":5,\"call\":\"orchestrate\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"Orchestrator.java\",\"lineNumber\":267,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.apache.gobblin.service.modules.orchestration.Orchestrator\"}\r\n,{\"index\":6,\"call\":\"runJob\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"GobblinServiceJobScheduler.java\",\"lineNumber\":47}}\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe issue above from FlowTriggerHandler reveals two problems\r\n\r\n- The job referenced is not found by scheduler -> The job key is constructed with flow name/group instead of job name/group, which is probably causing this issue. We add a check for if this happens by searching for the jobKey within the scheduler and emit a metric in case we encounter it in the future. \r\n- Upon looking closely at the code, we also need to update the job props of the job in the scheduler to keep track of the event to set reminder for. The job props we set [here](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/69d7e0fa4df2499934462854514ddc9ddbfe7dc7/gobblin-service/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/service/modules/orchestration/FlowTriggerHandler.java#L176) are never used in [createTriggerForJob](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/69d7e0fa4df2499934462854514ddc9ddbfe7dc7/gobblin-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/scheduler/JobScheduler.java#L588) We want to use `StdScheduler.scheduleJob(JobDetail jobDetail, Set<? extends Trigger> triggersForJob, boolean replace)` to replace the `jobDetail` we construct when making a reminder event.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests static helper function to update job properties in JobDataMap with two types of input\r\n- testUpdatePropsInJobDataMap\r\n- testSetPropsInJobDataMap\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1877\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nManifest-based copy (FS distcp) shouldn't presume the manifest files to be on the same FileSystem used as the I/O source to copy from.  Instead allow optional config to provide an alternative solely for reading manifest files (enumerating filepaths).\r\n\r\nProposed config: `gobblin.copy.manifestBased.read.fs.uri` (after `gobblin.copy.manifestBased.manifest.location`, and `source.filebased.fs.uri`)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nImproved `ManifestBasedDatasetFinderTest`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T03:24:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T17:59:37Z","closed_at":"2023-08-15T17:59:37Z","merged_at":"2023-08-15T17:59:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"239405c9c2690afbbd8d63f1a137cc5796150665","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3739/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3739/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3739/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/17ac7526d678e8e5763eaddebde8d6395770836c","head":{"label":"phet:manifest-copy-alt-read-fs","ref":"manifest-copy-alt-read-fs","sha":"17ac7526d678e8e5763eaddebde8d6395770836c","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin has the ability to process records from multiple kafka brokers, across multiple *.conf files and *.job files. But the tracking metadata / observability does a poor job of specifying which broker the events correspond to.\r\n\r\nThis is because Gobblin was written with the assumption that it would consume from a single aggregate kafka broker (e.g. brooklin). But going forward, we want to add support for multiple *.conf files each with their own kafka broker. This change adds a utility for mapping the different Kafka broker URI's to a simple human readable name that can be used within `GobblinTrackingEvent` and `GobblinMetadataChangeEvent`s for Iceberg data loss tracking.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`gobblin-modules/gobblin-kafka-common/src/test/java/org/apache/gobblin/KafkaCommonUtilTest.java`\r\n- tests that the map parsing works correctly\r\n`gobblin-modules/gobblin-kafka-common/src/test/java/org/apache/gobblin/source/extractor/extract/kafka/KafkaExtractorTest.java`\r\n- Tests the assumptions error codes for having exactly one `kafka.brokers` specified, and that the simple name map is defined with the kafka broker specified in `kafka.brokers` is also defined in the map. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T00:48:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T23:54:50Z","closed_at":"2023-08-15T23:54:50Z","merged_at":"2023-08-15T23:54:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"69d7e0fa4df2499934462854514ddc9ddbfe7dc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3738/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3738/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3738/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5daf1903f20705fcd76e69fa0b2eaafef9affd4e","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-util-for-kafka-broker-names-GOBBLIN-1876","ref":"mh-util-for-kafka-broker-names-GOBBLIN-1876","sha":"5daf1903f20705fcd76e69fa0b2eaafef9affd4e","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1875\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe are seeing the following errors when trying to schedule reminders for Multi-active scheduler after losing lease acquisition:\r\n`Unable to store Trigger with name: '...' and group: '...' because one already exists with this identification`\r\nThe Quartz scheduler allows multiple unique triggers mapping to one job in a N:1 relation, but this requires the trigger having a unique identifier associated with it. When we create triggers, we were previously using only the job name and group to identify the trigger so we're unable to add additional triggers for the same job. The trigger key is only used internally by the Quartz scheduler, so it is safe to manipulate by adding a random number to identify the trigger. We also don't expect more than a handful of triggers associated with a job, so an int 0 to 1000 will be sufficient to uniquely identify the trigger.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`testCreateUniqueTriggersForJob` creates two triggers with the same job key and verifies the trigger key's are unique\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    6. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    7. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    8. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    9. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    10. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-04T20:34:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T17:04:37Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T17:04:37Z","merged_at":"2023-08-11T17:04:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"666ae2e83e9f7c3406f9cf7a002b18fce565eb36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0f7ad199cdf5baeea0c77b6196b3ed00f8884722","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:create-instrumented-orc-writer","ref":"create-instrumented-orc-writer","sha":"0f7ad199cdf5baeea0c77b6196b3ed00f8884722","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1868 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCreate a Helper class **`FlowCompilationValidationHelper`** to contain functionality re-used between the `DagManager` and `Orchestrator` when launching executions of a flow spec. In the common case, the `Orchestrator` receives a flow to orchestrate, performs necessary validations, and forwards the execution responsibility to the `DagManager`. The `DagManager's` responsibility is to carry out any flow action requests. However, with launch executions now being stored in the `DagActionStateStore`, on restart or leadership change the `DagManager` has to perform validations before executing any launch actions the previous leader was unable to complete. \r\nWe tried to have the `DagManager` refer to the `Orchestrator` to avoid duplicating code in a previous commit, but introduced a circular dependency between the `DagManager` and `Orchestrator` and was unable to work in runtime. This class is utilized to store the common functionality. It is stateful, requiring all stateful pieces to be passed as input from the caller upon instantiating the helper.\r\nNote: We expect further refactoring to be done to the DagManager in later stage of multi-active development so we do not attempt major reorganization as abstractions may change. \r\n\r\nAlso creates a class, **`SharedFlowMetricsSingleton`** to store shared metrics between the  `DagManager` and `Orchestrator`. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDeploys locally and service starts \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-04T00:03:20Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T20:19:56Z","closed_at":"2023-08-07T20:19:55Z","merged_at":"2023-08-07T20:19:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"01036ccd45ae4ddf21a6e60acc84da70ccd097c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3731/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3731/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3731/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5f8aa8e4b2a2a0b3476d6d15780452394b1a7627","head":{"label":"umustafi:refactorCommonUtilsMetrics","ref":"refactorCommonUtilsMetrics","sha":"5f8aa8e4b2a2a0b3476d6d15780452394b1a7627","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1865\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWith \"gobblin.cluster.job.useGeneratedJobIds\" configuration, jobs with that prefix should be using the system timestamp of Gobblin cluster instead of a provided flow execution ID.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, it is more consistent to append flowExecutionId to a jobName then append a timestamp on top of that, so that all earlystop jobs relating to a flow execution can be tracked.\r\n\r\nNow jobNames should have the following structure:\r\njob_ActualJob<jobName><flowExecutionId><timestamp>\r\n\r\nThe timestamp is needed so that Helix can run concurrent jobs given a job ID.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T20:06:36Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T21:13:46Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T20:31:12Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T20:31:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"208742617cce8d6927145ce770028176d1b02bee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/07592c1935eeeffedfd2bab12b6352dbd71cc1e1","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-bug-gobblin-cluster-id-fix","ref":"fix-bug-gobblin-cluster-id-fix","sha":"07592c1935eeeffedfd2bab12b6352dbd71cc1e1","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1864\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf one type of watermark calculation fails (e.g. due to missing tier, or count being 0) it causes all watermarks not to get updated. This PR allows watermarks to get updated individually to avoid blocking other ones if they are working correctly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test which reproduces the issue\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-31T20:43:02Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T20:40:55Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T20:40:54Z","merged_at":"2023-08-01T20:40:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"951809d4327df564d423ee0f3073ff192f7a9f18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7fa4fabe0a2275b0aaa3f308be30857a36f64d49","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:audit-fix","ref":"audit-fix","sha":"7fa4fabe0a2275b0aaa3f308be30857a36f64d49","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1863\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n- `DagManager` check leader status before `addDag` bc calling this method from non-leader hosts throws a `NPE` which may caused failed dag event to be emitted. Then those job executions are skipped since they are marked as failed. \r\n- also handle `LAUNCH` type events upon leader change and setting a new participant `DagManager` to be active. Failing to handle these events may be causing missed flow launches on any leader change or restart. \r\nRefactoring Done \r\n- Create a static function in Orchestrator to emit a flow failed event if spec compilation fails. This function is shared by the between the `DagManager` and `Orchestrator`. It takes in the `eventSubmitter`  as an argument to emit the event.\r\n- I abstracted all the checks in `Orchestrator.orchestrate` done to compile the flow and ensure an execution is allowed to be re-used by the DagActionStoreChangeMonitor when submitting the flow to the `DagManager` by calling `submitFlowToDagManager`. \r\n- **Note** that we skip spec compilation in multi-active mode to avoid two compilations since it's a memory intensive process and we can wait to do it before submitting to the `DagManager`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-28T21:22:48Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T23:00:58Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T23:00:58Z","merged_at":"2023-08-01T23:00:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d13c3276a51ea5a6a1801eff5fd89dc8493a254a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8b9be6e88d6b7e846ca5d9b36c972cfc5558b506","head":{"label":"umustafi:multiActiveBugs","ref":"multiActiveBugs","sha":"8b9be6e88d6b7e846ca5d9b36c972cfc5558b506","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following JIRA (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1866) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nGobblin distcp copies the file permissions but not the sticky bit. As the expectation is that the destination files have preserved permissions from the source, we want to maintain the sticky bit across copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n-- Unit test to compare the input and output FsPermission with and without sticky bits with different permission modes\r\n-- A workflow on HDFS where a  directory is copied from one location to another.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n☑︎ My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n   1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n   2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n   3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n   4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n   5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n   6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T22:56:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T22:06:55Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T22:06:55Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T22:06:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"2917b6311949d25f898a6691fe0730d344299d25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3726/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3726/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3726/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/577915310ca82d39da3f731c6507a7daef501fb2","head":{"label":"y242yang:master","ref":"master","sha":"577915310ca82d39da3f731c6507a7daef501fb2","user":{"login":"y242yang","id":35815874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODE1ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35815874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang","html_url":"https://github.com/y242yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":671263524,"node_id":"R_kgDOKAKrJA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"y242yang/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"y242yang","id":35815874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODE1ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35815874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang","html_url":"https://github.com/y242yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y242yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/y242yang/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1862] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1862\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDue to possible issues upstream reporting incorrect reference counts for number of records, there could be times when the reference count reported to be 0.\r\nIn the current case, if reference tier counter is reported to be 0 but there are counts in other PCM tiers, an exception is thrown, however is silently swallowed, thus, causing the watermark to not move forward in this case.\r\nThis PR fixes said issue, allowing reference count to be 0 but no less. For completeness percentage calculations in such cases, the completeness will be reported as positive infinity as any number divided by double 0 is positive infinity.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test added to check that no exceptions are encountered when reference count is 0\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T01:02:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T23:58:57Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T23:58:56Z","merged_at":"2023-08-01T23:58:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"183bc5c44550b8ca888d589e849c3fb7dad8e90f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2b95234643c0850068984fe65b7a66aff0000b92","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:master","ref":"master","sha":"2b95234643c0850068984fe65b7a66aff0000b92","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1861\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe total completion watermark whitelist was not respected when a change_property GMCE was sent. These should be treated the same as add_files GMCEs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested with a whitelisted and non-whitelisted topic in test pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1860\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen job fails during workunit creation, it sets the job state as FAILED, but does not set JOB_FAILURES_KEY.\r\nIt also does not have datasets created if it fails at such an early stage and the current code relies on dataset state's properties to find the failure count.\r\nThis PR will set the config JOB_FAILURES_KEY when the job fails.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1859 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn multi-active mode, multiple participants will be reading/writing to MySQL table. We want to make sure each participant acts on the table in a manner that takes into account that the state may have changed while the MultiActiveLeaseArbiter is processing the result of a READ. This PR adds unit tests that validate SQL Insertion statements are conditional upon the state of the particular row corresponding to the flow action event being unchanged from the read made by this participant. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe PR adds 3 unit tests to test each of the cases of acquiring a lease to ensure the following insertions do not complete if the state has changed from our initial read. \r\n- insert when there is no matching primary key in the table\r\n- insert if a lease has expired\r\n- insert if a lease has completed \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T22:08:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T22:04:53Z","closed_at":"2023-08-10T22:04:53Z","merged_at":"2023-08-10T22:04:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"01c433c6dffcfd8bf699313542f2e386b87d4627","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/614d27d81af491c0588fe9ed60b8f716a53f592b","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/multiParticipantUnitTest","ref":"umustafi/multiParticipantUnitTest","sha":"614d27d81af491c0588fe9ed60b8f716a53f592b","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

cluster system time\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1857\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nJob Execution ID is automatically inferred from the flow execution ID if the job was orchestrated by Gobblin-as-a-Service. However, this can lead to bugs in conjunction with other job keys such as earlyStop, since it would create multiple planningJobs and job IDs sent to Helix. These jobs would then have the same execution ID which is rejected by Helix.\r\n\r\nWhen the user sets a configuration `gobblin.cluster.job.useGeneratedJobExecutionIds` are set, we want to force the Gobblin cluster to default to creating the job execution ID from its timestamp. This may make the job harder to track but earlyStop jobs are already difficult to track due to having multiple submitted Helix jobs\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-19T20:25:00Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T21:18:36Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T21:18:36Z","merged_at":"2023-07-20T21:18:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"bea009e6035937643bfbed73b7b63455a02d790f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f73b1ee8221835c416a3b4feca6325d3f97335e0","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-configuration-for-generated-helix-jobexecutionid","ref":"add-configuration-for-generated-helix-jobexecutionid","sha":"f73b1ee8221835c416a3b4feca6325d3f97335e0","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

This did not break our CI because iceberg tests run as a group in ABC order, so one of the tests was properly starting the metastore. But going forward, we should call the method and have an empty catch in case another test already init the hive metastore. \r\n\r\nThis would cause a NPE when the tests were run in isolation. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/acd8c3d5-7601-47db-94a6-cf8390a08ad6)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe HiveMetadataWriter and IcebergMetadataWriter make schema changes and need to make calls to Hive / HDFS per GMCE. This is an unnecessary hotspot because we can reference the schema cache beforehand and determine whether we actually need to make network call. \r\n\r\nAlso, there are cases where the HiveMetadataWriter can update the latest schema to be a null schema. We want to fail earlier, and fail the code when updating the latest schema map instead of failing later with a NPE. I've also changed the if statement from `containsKey` to checking if the value is null so that if this somehow happens in the future, we do not try to update the table with a null schema which would cause a NPE\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1851 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTests all cases of trying to acquire a lease for a flow action event with one participant involved and makes corresponding fixes in the `MultiActiveLeaseArbiter`. \r\n\r\n- One key change this PR includes is to remove usage the participant's local `event_timestamp` in the database to identify the particular flow_action event. We swap it out for the database utilize the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP of the database to insert or keep track of our event. This is to avoid any discrepancies between local time and database time for future comparisons.\r\n- Large number of fixes relate to MySQL-specific bugs for example NULL values not being permitted by default, syntax errors in creation, inserting into a table with a create statement, etc...\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests the following cases\r\n- CASE 1 of acquire lease for a flow action event not present in DB\r\n- CASE 2 of acquire lease for a flow action event that already has a valid lease for the same event in db\r\n- CASE 3 of trying to acquire a lease for a distinct flow action event, while the previous event's lease is valid\r\n- CASE 4 of lease out of date\r\n- CASE 5 of no longer leasing the same event in DB\r\n- CASE 6 of no longer leasing a distinct event in DB\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-12T00:05:51Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T21:03:36Z","closed_at":"2023-07-18T21:03:36Z","merged_at":"2023-07-18T21:03:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca48bcd0aee7bb4ecd7277b25944bff9f4fc378f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3715/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3715/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3715/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b82d45a9d0708ff4f57e1c062ed61fd458fe4a21","head":{"label":"umustafi:multiActiveAlgoUnitTests","ref":"multiActiveAlgoUnitTests","sha":"b82d45a9d0708ff4f57e1c062ed61fd458fe4a21","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1850\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are dynamically determining at runtime whether to skip retention on a dataset and we are not allowing hive retention on a view as it doesn't have access to delete underlying data (#3695). \r\n\r\nHowever, we also need to not allow hive retention on a snapshot as it is only a point-in-time copy of the filesystem/directory. Instead of failing the entire job due to this snapshot format, and we do not want to have a static allow/denylist, it should throw a warning message instead and continue the retention job onto the next possiblility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested with a sample retention job and observed that no exceptions related to hive snapshot tables were encountered.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-10T20:20:54Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T20:12:49Z","closed_at":"2023-09-06T20:12:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20d80140a825272e999f6b732190e49dfc43a3db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0042abb77020c4ee1b10d4b6ac083d35c91ed74d","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/skip-snapshot-hive-cleaner","ref":"andjiang/skip-snapshot-hive-cleaner","sha":"0042abb77020c4ee1b10d4b6ac083d35c91ed74d","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1847] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1847\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf the JobLauncher encounters any errors, Gobblin code cleans up the working directory that contains Gobblin state. But we do not clean up the helix workflows. This can cause us to spin up helix workflows that do not have valid Gobblin State on HDFS / S3. \r\n\r\nWhen this occurs, it causes rapid container recycling, which puts tremendous load on Zookeeper due to Helix API calls, causing a peak in ZK callbacks\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/cafba644-bc69-4603-a5c8-3f2ba5ed9e77)\r\n\r\nThe cancellation logic is obnoxious, so here is the high level of what happens.\r\n1. Calling `AbstractJobLauncher#cancelJob(JobListener)` sets `AbstractJobLauncher#cancellationRequested` to `true`\r\n2. This causes the `AbstractJobLauncher#cancellationExecutor` created by the `AbstractJobLauncher#startCancellationExecutor()` method to call the abstract method `AbstractJobLauncher#executeCancellation()`\r\n3. That method implemented in `GobblinHelixJobLauncher#executeCancellation()`, which eventually calls `HelixUtils.cancelWorkflow(...)`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Considerations\r\n- I considered modifying the `runWorkunits` itself since that is where the cleanup directory is called. But I wanted to leverage the existing the cancellation request logic (which is admittedly super overkill and has a ton of concurrency). We also collect a ton of metrics during the cancellation process, so it's important that I call the cancel method that is part of the `AbstractJobLauncher`. Since we need access to the job listener, it makes most sense to have it be part of the `launchJob` method\r\n  \r\n- The reason I clean up even when there is a successful finish, is because there isn't really a reason not to cancel a workflow to run after the job is finished for Fast Ingest. The cancel call is safe to call multiple times and there are clearly still edge cases where we don't call cancel properly\r\n- I am not a fan of adding a new flag, but I want to maintain backward compatibility since this job launcher is used beyond Fast Ingest\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/48db7f5e-38b4-4789-88d5-7163f0b7068b)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    3. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-27T05:06:01Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T17:51:15Z","closed_at":"2023-06-28T17:51:15Z","merged_at":"2023-06-28T17:51:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6b49c7144a0f7663ae4e80b336bf44f2de07253","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/cabb9687dfd2e373d457bd78db5d3b2f9fb31101","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-dont-fail-if-zk-exception-ETL-14877","ref":"mh-dont-fail-if-zk-exception-ETL-14877","sha":"cabb9687dfd2e373d457bd78db5d3b2f9fb31101","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1844] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1844\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen the `GobblinClusterManager` starts, it will do an asynchronous deletion of workflows (all workflow deletions are technically async). And we do not want the yarn service to acknowledge these workflows while the controller processes the request asynchronously. \r\n\r\nWhen there is heavy load on the zookeeper cluster, the deletes will be slow and there will be significant overlap of having 2 of the same workflows \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nModified existing unit to cover edge case of workflows that marked for deletion. Also refactored the testing code to improve the readability since there is a ton of copy paste involved for creating a workflow which is difficult to read\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/96f38f67-aae8-45c9-9867-6bc34a8cbef4)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-21T19:40:31Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T21:30:56Z","closed_at":"2023-06-26T21:30:55Z","merged_at":"2023-06-26T21:30:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"702cadf48f910c79b129032aa673f08ce4397c03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/33674da0d0a44edbd62430743dc160024cd0cae1","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-ignore-deleted-workflows-GOBBLIN-1844","ref":"mh-ignore-deleted-workflows-GOBBLIN-1844","sha":"33674da0d0a44edbd62430743dc160024cd0cae1","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1841] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1841\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe method `disableLiveHelixInstances()` originally exists in `GobblinYarnAppLauncher` to disable pre-existing live instances in a Helix cluster. However, there can be an edge case when the `GobblinYarnAppLauncher` is bypassed due to a lost Application Master, like an automated replacement of the Application Master by Yarn, which will bypass the Azkaban Yarn App Launcher. In such cases, the `disableLiveHelixInstances()` will be not invoked.\r\nThus, we moved this method to `GobblinClusterManager`, which is at the Application Master level, and invokes it at the start stage. In this way, we can guarantee that it won't miss the edge case, and each time these pre-existing live instances can be disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n<img width=\"518\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-21 at 10 21 26 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/112960226/6d7468ce-8826-4984-8d2b-7812e503e02d\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-21T17:24:38Z","updated_at":"2023-06-30T21:41:05Z","closed_at":"2023-06-30T21:41:04Z","merged_at":"2023-06-30T21:41:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d14b86a5bdb1b99d7fc13a5864a831ff9221b1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/fabb39f1afbf32ea4fe25ea33321d1ff54f6d054","head":{"label":"Peiyingy:py-move-disabling-of-current-live-instances-GOBBLIN-1841","ref":"py-move-disabling-of-current-live-instances-GOBBLIN-1841","sha":"fabb39f1afbf32ea4fe25ea33321d1ff54f6d054","user":{"login":"Peiyingy","id":112960226,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrui4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112960226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy","html_url":"https://github.com/Peiyingy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":648730903,"node_id":"R_kgDOJqrZFw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Peiyingy/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Peiyingy","id":112960226,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrui4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112960226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy","html_url":"https://github.com/Peiyingy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Peiyingy/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1846\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFollow up to previous PR [GOBBLIN-1837](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3700) to add validation via logging statements that we will query to ensure no scheduled trigger events are missed during host downtime. Also moves `Flow` specific logic from `JobScheduler` to `GobblinServiceJobScheduler`. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nN/A to be added in the future but will be validated using these statements and local deploy\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-20T23:25:10Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T21:04:06Z","closed_at":"2023-06-22T21:04:06Z","merged_at":"2023-06-22T21:04:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"5af6bca57df909e44b995e5b2d667c70e0399877","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4134631a1fcd6c5702cc080a9fc2a2ce71e72264","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/validationForMultiActiveScheduler","ref":"umustafi/validationForMultiActiveScheduler","sha":"4134631a1fcd6c5702cc080a9fc2a2ce71e72264","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

 to avoid classloader issues in spark\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1845] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1845\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDatasetsFinderFilteringDecorator uses parallel stream on datasets to filter them on predicates. When this code runs in spark, system class loader gets used to pickup hive jar instead of the current conext class loader which leads to ClassNotFound issues \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSmall change that should already be covered in unit tests\r\nAlso, tested this on the hadoop cluster at linkedin\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-17T05:21:24Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T01:56:32Z","closed_at":"2023-06-20T01:56:32Z","merged_at":"2023-06-20T01:56:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd9f9c454832036a4bbab9c1997f5f9da9cb0891","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3706/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3706/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3706/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a5a5924bf4450dbbd0272be25b0d21db899fd3cc","head":{"label":"vikrambohra:GOBBLIN-1845","ref":"GOBBLIN-1845","sha":"a5a5924bf4450dbbd0272be25b0d21db899fd3cc","user":{"login":"vikrambohra","id":24703997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24703997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra","html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177204474,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzcyMDQ0NzQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"vikrambohra/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vikrambohra","id":24703997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24703997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra","html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1843] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1843\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDatasets with URN that have a `-` will be represented in Hive with an `_`.  Failing to do so will mean the code will fail to pull up the correct hive table\r\n\r\nThis code will replace all '-' with '_' before querying hive. We do not need to consider lower / uppercase because hive is case insensitive\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n<img width=\"464\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/35702680/a30b9ef5-4d9f-4b7d-a5d6-a5d7ce9ad18a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-14T21:39:13Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T18:34:45Z","closed_at":"2023-06-15T18:34:44Z","merged_at":"2023-06-15T18:34:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee17b1576759c0669bf7bc46c9faf6868544ceb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/411583777c4616fcf908c8d46fef54d07ec09eca","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-nonoptionalunion-fix-GOBBLIN-1843","ref":"mh-nonoptionalunion-fix-GOBBLIN-1843","sha":"411583777c4616fcf908c8d46fef54d07ec09eca","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1840] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1840\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n#### Problem Statement\r\nCurrently, there is a problem with the Helix replanner, that Azkaban jobs can be triggered at the same time, causing replanning to happen in a short time span twice or more. It is expensive to create a replanner, consuming a lot of resources and a long time for both the Zookeeper and the Application Master.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nWe implemented a concurrent hashmap to store the create time for each job so that we can check the hashmap record to make sure that we only reschedule the workflow when the last replanning is earlier than the throttle timeout threshold, which has a default time of an hour and totally configurable. We also have a throttling feature that is able to turn off, stopping this early return mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n<img width=\"333\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-14 at 11 00 50 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/112960226/098448b9-ee6d-4f7f-9672-d51ad7f62b48\">\r\n\r\nThe unit tests are permutations regards to three variables: same or different workflow, time span, and whether throttling is enabled. The original testNewJobAndUpdate is for the same workflow, long time period, and throttle enabled. The rest of the tests have descriptive names.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-14T18:01:19Z","updated_at":"2023-06-30T17:41:45Z","closed_at":"2023-06-30T17:41:44Z","merged_at":"2023-06-30T17:41:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ecce5bc733b047b3c2b945cf4eba2bc21bac241","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/249621209d3ddbf4de3302d3dd35e11da80dd7fc","head":{"label":"Peiyingy:py-helix-scheduler-throttle-GOBBLIN-1840","ref":"py-helix-scheduler-throttle-GOBBLIN-1840","sha":"249621209d3ddbf4de3302d3dd35e11da80dd7fc","user":{"login":"Peiyingy","id":112960226,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrui4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112960226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy","html_url":"https://github.com/Peiyingy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":648730903,"node_id":"R_kgDOJqrZFw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Peiyingy/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Peiyingy","id":112960226,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrui4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112960226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy","html_url":"https://github.com/Peiyingy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peiyingy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Peiyingy/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1842\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd timers for:\r\n- hivespec computation\r\n- write for each metadata writer\r\n- flush for each metadata writer\r\n\r\nThese timers are set up with a 1 hour sliding window, so the statistics will be for the last hour of execution. The timers are registered with metric context so they will send metrics through gobblin's metric framework. Also, added logging during every flush interval (every 1 min) which logs the current mean/99th percentile of every timer, so it is easier to see where time is being spent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan test pipeline. Example timer logs:\r\n```\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - begin flushing 0 records\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.IcebergMetadataWriter.write 1 hour mean duration: 10 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.IcebergMetadataWriter.write 1 hour 99th percentile duration: 104 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.hive.writer.HiveMetadataWriter.write 1 hour mean duration: 14 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.hive.writer.HiveMetadataWriter.write 1 hour 99th percentile duration: 213 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.IcebergMetadataWriter.flush 1 hour mean duration: 3756 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.IcebergMetadataWriter.flush 1 hour 99th percentile duration: 69138 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.hive.writer.HiveMetadataWriter.flush 1 hour mean duration: 0 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer org.apache.gobblin.hive.writer.HiveMetadataWriter.flush 1 hour 99th percentile duration: 1 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer hiveSpec.computation 1 hour mean duration: 10 ms\r\n2023-06-13 11:16:58 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.iceberg.writer.GobblinMCEWriter  - Timer hiveSpec.computation 1 hour 99th percentile duration: 19 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1838\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - Currently the completion watermark is determined according to the completeness percentage: `max of srcCount/refCount, for each refTier`. This change introduces a new \"total count based completion watermark\", which is determined by a new completeness percentage: `srcCount / sum of all refCount, for each refTier`. The new total count based watermark will be used to check the completeness of data which is aggregated from multiple tiers.\r\n    - This PR also refactors existing codes and introduces `CompletenessWatermarkUpdater`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds new test cases in the following unit tests:\r\n    - adds new test cases in the existing `KafkaAuditCountVerifierTest` and `IcebergMetadataWriterTest`\r\n    - adds new unit test `CompletenessWatermarkUpdaterTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-30T21:21:49Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T19:25:20Z","closed_at":"2023-07-24T19:25:20Z","merged_at":"2023-07-24T19:25:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba408f23c89357bc36ee70415041c2cff2b36df0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/98e5ecdaaca1a4238c0efb5ed821c9678f592c4e","head":{"label":"wsarecv:tqin/total","ref":"tqin/total","sha":"98e5ecdaaca1a4238c0efb5ed821c9678f592c4e","user":{"login":"wsarecv","id":35046097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDQ2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35046097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv","html_url":"https://github.com/wsarecv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":623188101,"node_id":"R_kgDOJSUYhQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"wsarecv/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wsarecv","id":35046097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDQ2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35046097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv","html_url":"https://github.com/wsarecv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wsarecv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wsarecv/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1837\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis task will include the implementation of non-blocking, multi-active scheduler for each host. The algorithm is described in much greater detail in the Java docs written for the classes below. Please read them for clarification. This PR will NOT include metric emission or unit tests for validation. That will be done in a separate follow-up ticket. The work in this ticket includes\r\n\r\nNew Classes\r\n- define a general interface `MultiActiveLeaseArbiter` used to define a generic approach for the non-blocking, multi participant system which will be used for the `Scheduler` but can be extended in the future to `DagManager` and other modules of the system that we want to alter to multi-active\r\n- implements a MySQL based implementation of `MultiActiveLeaseArbiter` called `MsqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter` which uses a MySQL store to resolve ownership of a flow event among multiple competing participants\r\n- defines a table of constants in the database to have consistency across participants when applying the non-blocking algorithm above\r\n- defines a handler `FlowTriggerHandler` to coordinate between hosts with enabled schedulers to respond to flow action events -> only handling triggers to LAUNCH an event in the meantime \r\n \r\nModifications to Existing Classes\r\n- update `DagActionStore` schema and `DagActionStoreMonitor` to act upon new `LAUNCH` type events in addition to KILL/RESUME\r\n- update `JobScheduler` to store the timestamp of the trigger event within it's job properties\r\n- update `Orchestrator` logic to trigger the event using the algorithm above if `multi-active scheduler` is enabled, otherwise submit events directly to the DagManager after receiving a scheduler trigger\r\n\r\nNOTE: because I'm updating the DagActionStore schema this change will require manually altering the primary key of the table before deploying these changes. MySQL only creates/updates the table if the same table name does not exist.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nLimiting the scope of this PR to the implementation and will focus on metrics, logging for validation, and unit tests in a separate PR. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-26T21:06:41Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T17:10:08Z","closed_at":"2023-06-15T17:10:07Z","merged_at":"2023-06-15T17:10:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"faa3a4f60b6ef763d620245b1535b75728a9802e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b6b78a56e7d96ba54c040be8eea50b7224b14bed","head":{"label":"umustafi:multiActiveScheduler","ref":"multiActiveScheduler","sha":"b6b78a56e7d96ba54c040be8eea50b7224b14bed","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1836\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn our system, when a helix disconnection occurs, we take the necessary step to cancel the ongoing job. Furthermore, when we opt for a graceful exit, we ensure that no exception is thew and we mark the task as complete. However, it is important to note that due to this graceful exit, the task cannot be retried accurately. \r\n\r\nSo we need to introduce a cancel flag to make sure we return the correct task status\r\n\r\nAlso, a small fix to add schema.literal when creating a new iceberg table. (Ideally, iceberg should work without schema.literal property, but some downstream query engine need the original avro schema to do processing, so this property is added to support that use case)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded new unit test for cancellation logic\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-25T23:57:25Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T20:53:59Z","closed_at":"2023-06-02T20:53:59Z","merged_at":"2023-06-02T20:53:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"a00b57cda36acf9e30f9856bdc69383528f70486","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a9d226bbd292238ad056b128fcbdb2d75575bc4c","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1836","ref":"GOBBLIN-1836","sha":"a9d226bbd292238ad056b128fcbdb2d75575bc4c","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1805\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, Audit check is done for [currentWatermark, currentWatermark +1hour] window for quiet topics. However when the audit check for this window fails (due to an upstream bug in audit), the watermark never progress as the currentWatermark is never updated. To avoid this we keep progressing the watermark by checking the window [currentHour -1, currentHour] window\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated unit test to reflect this change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-25T21:16:13Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T16:41:30Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T16:41:29Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T16:41:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"51a852d506b749b9ac33568aff47105e14972a57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a7d398dce731768cbffaf1bf01ef5a96190bcc35","head":{"label":"vikrambohra:GOBBLIN-1805","ref":"GOBBLIN-1805","sha":"a7d398dce731768cbffaf1bf01ef5a96190bcc35","user":{"login":"vikrambohra","id":24703997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24703997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra","html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177204474,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzcyMDQ0NzQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"vikrambohra/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vikrambohra","id":24703997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24703997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra","html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1835\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI want to upgrade our iceberg version to 1.2.0 to leverage performance improvements such as optimized metadata caching, reduced memory consumption, and faster metadata commits, enhanced APIs, schema evolution. Most importantly it natively provides support for Apache Spark 3.x, allowing seamless integration and improved performance when using Iceberg with Spark. As part of this upgrade, below are the major changes:\r\n- Update method signatures for `CatalogUtil.loadCatalog()` and `Snapshots.allManifests`\r\n- Initialize and load `HiveCatalog` via `CatalogUtil` inside `IcebergMetadataWriter` \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Updated unit tests\r\n- Successful Build\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-20T03:00:48Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T23:39:13Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T23:39:12Z","merged_at":"2023-06-14T23:39:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"949b01927e642a40a1f5c208926925988910c064","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9096f57b7f33187739faeecf22de6b496256679d","head":{"label":"meethngala:upgrade-iceberg-version","ref":"upgrade-iceberg-version","sha":"9096f57b7f33187739faeecf22de6b496256679d","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A
