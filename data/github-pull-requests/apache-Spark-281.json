What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAnalysisBarrier was introduced in SPARK-20392 to improve analysis speed (don't re-analyze nodes that have already been analyzed).\r\n\r\nBefore AnalysisBarrier, we already had some infrastructure in place, with analysis specific functions (resolveOperators and resolveExpressions). These functions do not recursively traverse down subplans that are already analyzed (with a mutable boolean flag _analyzed). The issue with the old system was that developers started using transformDown, which does a top-down traversal of the plan tree, because there was not top-down resolution function, and as a result analyzer performance became pretty bad.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the issue in SPARK-20392, AnalysisBarrier was introduced as a special node and for this special node, transform/transformUp/transformDown don't traverse down. However, the introduction of this special node caused a lot more troubles than it solves. This implicit node breaks assumptions and code in a few places, and it's hard to know when analysis barrier would exist, and when it wouldn't. Just a simple search of AnalysisBarrier in PR discussions demonstrates it is a source of bugs and additional complexity.\r\n\r\nInstead, this pull request removes AnalysisBarrier and reverts back to the old approach. We added infrastructure in tests that fail explicitly if transform methods are used in the analyzer.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test suite AnalysisHelperSuite for testing the resolve* methods and transform* methods.","created_at":"2018-07-20T00:06:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T06:32:58Z","closed_at":"2018-07-27T06:32:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"610fcbcca7b5d55105338a0c3b119986396a5f7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fe528010f98ccbafaa486a8d57afced0e6f10393","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-24865","ref":"SPARK-24865","sha":"fe528010f98ccbafaa486a8d57afced0e6f10393","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis builds on top of SPARK-24748 to report 'offset lag' as a custom metrics for Kafka structured streaming source.\r\n\r\nThis lag is the difference between the latest offsets in Kafka the time the metrics is reported (just after a micro-batch completes) and the latest offset Spark has processed. It can be 0 (or close to 0) if spark keeps up with the rate at which messages are ingested into Kafka topics in steady state. This measures how far behind the spark source has fallen behind (per partition) and can aid in tuning the application.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting and new unit tests\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-19T20:27:26Z","updated_at":"2018-08-18T09:34:49Z","closed_at":"2018-08-18T09:34:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dfb9b352afe8ef59baab088cb8d6f3f485dd8c38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ffa20babf22c308d5fbfcfd1a17af520b340d501","head":{"label":"arunmahadevan:SPARK-24863","ref":"SPARK-24863","sha":"ffa20babf22c308d5fbfcfd1a17af520b340d501","user":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130400725,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA0MDA3MjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"arunmahadevan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn standalone cluster mode, one could launch driver with supervise mode\r\nenabled. StandaloneRestServer class uses the host and port of current\r\nmaster as the spark.master property while launching the driver\r\n(even if you are running in HA mode). This class also ignores the\r\nspark.master property passed as part of the request.\r\n\r\nDue to the above problem, if the Spark masters switch due to some reason\r\nand your driver is killed unexpectedly and relaunched, it will try to\r\nconnect to the master which is in the driver command specified as\r\n-Dspark.master. But this master will be in STANDBY mode and after trying\r\nmultiple times, the SparkContext will kill itself (even though secondary\r\nmaster was alive and healthy).\r\n\r\nThis change picks the spark.master property from request and uses it to\r\nlaunch the driver process. Due to this, the driver process has both\r\nmasters in -Dspark.master property. Even if the masters switch, SparkContext\r\ncan still connect to the ALIVE master and work correctly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was manually tested on a standalone cluster running 2.2.1. It was rebased on current master and all tests were executed. I have added a unit test for this change (but since I am new I hope I have covered all).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-19T09:00:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T17:27:58Z","closed_at":"2018-10-25T13:40:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90b37571edc44f30288f69b3f1c55a1e2f38c9d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4cd891af1f63f0a3ba46526f5af141d068ee4a7d","head":{"label":"bsikander:rest_driver_fix","ref":"rest_driver_fix","sha":"4cd891af1f63f0a3ba46526f5af141d068ee4a7d","user":{"login":"bsikander","id":4642104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDIxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4642104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander","html_url":"https://github.com/bsikander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141286136,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDEyODYxMzY=","name":"spark","full_name":"bsikander/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bsikander","id":4642104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDIxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4642104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander","html_url":"https://github.com/bsikander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsikander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bsikander/spark","description":"Mirror

now:\r\n\r\n1. Sub scalar query was made (for instance `SELECT (SELECT id FROM foo)`).\r\n\r\n2. Try to extract some common expressions (via `CodeGenerator.subexpressionElimination`) so that it can generates some common codes and can be reused.\r\n\r\n3. During this, seems it extracts some expressions that can be reused (via `EquivalentExpressions.addExprTree`)\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b2deef64f604ddd9502a31105ed47cb63470ec85/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/CodeGenerator.scala#L1102\r\n\r\n4. During this, if the hash (`EquivalentExpressions.Expr.hashCode`) happened to be the same at `EquivalentExpressions.addExpr` anyhow, `EquivalentExpressions.Expr.equals` is called to identify object in the same hash, which eventually calls `semanticEquals` in `ScalarSubquery`\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/087879a77acb37b790c36f8da67355b90719c2dc/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala#L54\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/087879a77acb37b790c36f8da67355b90719c2dc/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala#L36\r\n\r\n5. `ScalarSubquery`'s `semanticEquals` needs `SubqueryExec`'s `sameResult`\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/77a2fc5b521788b406bb32bcc3c637c1d7406e58/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/subquery.scala#L58\r\n\r\n6. `SubqueryExec`'s `sameResult` requires a canonicalized plan which calls `FileSourceScanExec`'s `doCanonicalize`\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e008ad175256a3192fdcbd2c4793044d52f46d57/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/QueryPlan.scala#L258\r\n\r\n7. In `FileSourceScanExec`'s `doCanonicalize`, `FileSourceScanExec`'s `relation` is required but seems `@transient` so it becomes `null`.\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e76b0124fbe463def00b1dffcfd8fd47e04772fe/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L527\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e76b0124fbe463def00b1dffcfd8fd47e04772fe/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L160\r\n\r\n8. NPE is thrown.\r\n\r\n\\*1. driver side\r\n\\*2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8. executor side\r\n\r\nNote that most of cases, it looks fine because we will usually call:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/087879a77acb37b790c36f8da67355b90719c2dc/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala#L40\r\n\r\nwhich make a canonicalized plan via:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b045315e5d87b7ea3588436053aaa4d5a7bd103f/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/Expression.scala#L192\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/77a2fc5b521788b406bb32bcc3c637c1d7406e58/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/subquery.scala#L52\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce?\r\n\r\nThis looks what happened now. I can reproduce this by a bit of messy way:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala b/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala\r\nindex 8d06804ce1e..d25fc9a7ba9 100644\r\n--- a/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala\r\n+++ b/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/EquivalentExpressions.scala\r\n@@ -37,7 +37,9 @@ class EquivalentExpressions {\r\n       case _ => false\r\n     }\r\n    \r\n-    override def hashCode: Int = e.semanticHash()\r\n+    override def hashCode: Int = {\r\n+      1\r\n+    }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/foo\")\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/foo\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"foo\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\", false)\r\nsql(\"SELECT (SELECT id FROM foo) == (SELECT id FROM foo)\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix?\r\n\r\n- Make all variables that access to `FileSourceScanExec`'s `relation` as `lazy val` so that we avoid NPE. This is a temporary fix.\r\n\r\n- Allow `makeCopy` in `SparkPlan` without Spark session too. This looks still able to be accessed within executor side.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInitialize SaslEncryption$EncryptedMessage.byteChannel lazily,\r\nso that empty, not yet used instances of ByteArrayWritableChannel\r\nreferenced by this field don't use up memory.\r\n\r\nI analyzed a heap dump from Yarn Node Manager where this code is used, and found that there are over 40,000 of the above objects in memory, each with a big empty byte[] array. The reason they are all there is because of Netty queued up a large number of messages in memory  before transferTo() is called. There is a small number of netty ChannelOutboundBuffer objects, and then collectively , via linked lists starting from their flushedEntry data fields, they end up referencing over 40K ChannelOutboundBuffer$Entry objects, which ultimately reference EncryptedMessage objects.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan all the tests locally.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-18T23:40:15Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T03:19:02Z","closed_at":"2018-07-27T03:19:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a65244c5e69aaa20e6aa2c8764c5fa46d84cfb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b465341314b1cbbef726950d589d5fb49db341b","head":{"label":"countmdm:misha/spark-24801","ref":"misha/spark-24801","sha":"8b465341314b1cbbef726950d589d5fb49db341b","user":{"login":"countmdm","id":6394099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6394099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm","html_url":"https://github.com/countmdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":135335771,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzUzMzU3NzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"countmdm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"countmdm","id":6394099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6394099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm","html_url":"https://github.com/countmdm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/countmdm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/countmdm/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the `StructType`/`StructField` classes by new method `toDDL` which converts a value of the `StructType`/`StructField` type to a string formatted in DDL style. The resulted string can be used in a table creation.\r\n\r\nThe `toDDL` method of `StructField` is reused in `SHOW CREATE TABLE`. In this way the PR fixes the bug of unquoted names of nested fields.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI add a test for checking the new method and 2 round trip tests: `fromDDL` -> `toDDL` and `toDDL` -> `fromDDL`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-18T14:47:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:06Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T18:12:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a652b8981f014a5add00f3bfc5c0d569072a50b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60f663d7b12fcb3141eff774a9120f049d837112","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:to-ddl","ref":"to-ddl","sha":"60f663d7b12fcb3141eff774a9120f049d837112","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose to add new option for AVRO datasource which should control ignoring of files without `.avro` extension in read. The option has name `ignoreExtension` with default value `true`. If both options `ignoreExtension` and `avro.mapred.ignore.inputs.without.extension` are set, `ignoreExtension` overrides the former one. Here is an example of usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark\r\n  .read\r\n  .option(\"ignoreExtension\", false)\r\n  .avro(\"path to avro files\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a test which checks the option directly and a test for checking that new option overrides hadoop's config.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-17T19:22:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:03Z","closed_at":"2018-07-21T03:08:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"030827e3baad13101c395ae330324f320975d030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3206a20fc9f3036e16eca20118e1559d722ff0b9","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-ignore-extension","ref":"avro-ignore-extension","sha":"3206a20fc9f3036e16eca20118e1559d722ff0b9","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo new rules in the logical plan optimizers are added.\r\n\r\n1. When there is only one element in the **`Collection`**, the\r\nphysical plan will be optimized to **`EqualTo`**, so predicate\r\npushdown can be used.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    profileDF.filter( $\"profileID\".isInCollection(Set(6))).explain(true)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n      |== Physical Plan ==\r\n      |*(1) Project [profileID#0]\r\n      |+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(profileID#0) && (profileID#0 = 6))\r\n      |   +- *(1) FileScan parquet [profileID#0] Batched: true, Format: Parquet,\r\n      |     PartitionFilters: [],\r\n      |     PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(profileID), EqualTo(profileID,6)],\r\n      |     ReadSchema: struct<profileID:int>\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. When the **`Collection`** is empty, and the input is nullable, the\r\nlogical plan will be simplified to\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    profileDF.filter( $\"profileID\".isInCollection(Set())).explain(true)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n      |== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\n      |Filter if (isnull(profileID#0)) null else false\r\n      |+- Relation[profileID#0] parquet\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n1. For multiple conditions with numbers less than certain thresholds,\r\nwe should still allow predicate pushdown.\r\n2. Optimize the **`In`** using **`tableswitch`** or **`lookupswitch`**\r\nwhen the numbers of the categories are low, and they are **`Int`**,\r\n**`Long`**.\r\n3. The default immutable hash trees set is slow for query, and we\r\nshould do benchmark for using different set implementation for faster\r\nquery.\r\n4. **`filter(if (condition) null else false)`** can be optimized to false.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCouple new tests are added.","created_at":"2018-07-17T17:38:04Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T00:37:44Z","closed_at":"2018-07-18T00:37:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfe2cc0d6ae0c780271a89fe3f03d60296f96720","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68e9f04db4a652accf8f1751e063cd9a389fbc07","head":{"label":"dbtsai:optimize-in","ref":"optimize-in","sha":"68e9f04db4a652accf8f1751e063cd9a389fbc07","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new feature to the driver and executor builders for K8S that\r\nallows providing host name aliases into the K8S pods.  This is useful\r\nfor environments where DNS is not usable or you need to add aliases to\r\nmake non-K8S services accessible.\r\n\r\nFor example in our environment we use host aliases to route internal system services e.g. Zookeeper without having to know the external host name of the system.\r\n\r\nWe are proposing this feature to replace a current hack we do with injecting host name entries into the Spark generated pods via entry point scripts in a custom images. \r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [ ] Integration tests\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for this functionality, integration tests to follow\r\n\r\nCC @mccheah

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, DataType equals* methods has lot of code duplication. This PR adds - \r\n1. Helper function that removes code duplication and makes it easier to understand. \r\n2. It makes adding new variations of equals* methods easy by simply choosing right parameter combinations of helper function.\r\n\r\n## Current functionality -\r\nDataTypes are matched on three factors - (fieldName, dataType, nullability)\r\nCurrent APIs\r\n\r\n> 1. equalsIgnoreNullability - (fieldNameCheck: Yes, dataType: Yes, nullability: No)\r\n> 2. equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullability - (fieldNameCheck: Yes, dataType: Yes, nullability: Compatible)\r\n> 3. equalsIgnoreCaseAndNullability - (fieldNameCheck: Yes(case insensitive), dataType: Yes, nullability: No)\r\n> 4. equalsStructurally - (fieldNameCheck: No, dataType: Yes, nullability: Yes/No)\r\n\r\nSame API contracts are maintained but just new helper functions equalsDataTypes, isSameFieldName, isSameNullability added to give more flexibility & code centralization.\r\nAdditional private vals are added to set behavior of helper functions.\r\n  ```\r\nprivate val NoNameCheck = 0\r\n  private val CaseSensitiveNameCheck = 1\r\n  private val CaseInsensitiveNameCheck = 2\r\n  private val NoNullabilityCheck = 0\r\n  private val NullabilityCheck = 1\r\n  private val CompatibleNullabilityCheck = 2\r\n```\r\nAny combination of above variables can be generated in future to add new equals* APIs. For instance, \r\n\r\n> equalsIgnoreCaseCompatibleNullability\r\n\r\n can easily be generated by calling -\r\n\r\n> equalsDataTypes(left, right, CaseInsensitiveNameCheck, CompatibleNullabilityCheck)\r\n\r\nNew scalatests added to test missing API unit testing as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCode was tested with existing scalatests. New scalatests added for more robust testing of this functionality.\r\nAll tests were ran locally to make sure it doesn't affect elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-17T04:35:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T02:52:14Z","closed_at":"2018-07-19T02:52:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06936cd466ae399c152fd80bf8a207f3f2063de1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad51942065023f4738252505122900317d550c50","head":{"label":"swapnilushinde:SPARK-24568","ref":"SPARK-24568","sha":"ad51942065023f4738252505122900317d550c50","user":{"login":"swapnilushinde","id":1649704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk3MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1649704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde","html_url":"https://github.com/swapnilushinde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137745927,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzc3NDU5Mjc=","name":"spark","full_name":"swapnilushinde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swapnilushinde","id":1649704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk3MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1649704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde","html_url":"https://github.com/swapnilushinde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swapnilushinde/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSQL interface support `repartitionByRange` to improvement data pushdown.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit tests, manual tests and benchmark tests.\r\n\r\nI have test this feature with a big table(data size: 1.1 T, row count: 282,001,954,428).\r\nThe test SQL:\r\n```sql\r\nselect * from table where id=401564838907\r\n```\r\nThe test result:\r\n\r\nMode | Input Size | Records | Total Time | Duration | Prepare data Resource Allocation   MB-seconds\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\ndefault | 959.2

`id=401564838907`, and the performance is greatly improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-16T09:21:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T17:02:22Z","closed_at":"2018-07-31T11:26:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1424c260264cec61856b9f1e0202ef65a6e3f866","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f2951db5a5b7a5030d9ac373a234ed1a007cce7","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-24816","ref":"SPARK-24816","sha":"5f2951db5a5b7a5030d9ac373a234ed1a007cce7","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9549a2814951f9ba969955d78ac4bd2240f85989","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

join key is long or int in broadcast join, Spark will use `LongToUnsafeRowMap` to store key-values of the table witch will be broadcasted. But, when `LongToUnsafeRowMap` is broadcasted to executors, and it is too big to hold in memory, it will be stored in disk. At that time, because `write` uses a variable `cursor` to determine how many bytes in `page` of `LongToUnsafeRowMap` will be write out and the `cursor` was not restore when deserializing, executor will write out nothing from page into disk.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRestore cursor value when

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change default behaviour of AVRO datasource which currently ignores files without `.avro` extension in read by default. This PR sets the default value for `avro.mapred.ignore.inputs.without.extension` to `false` in the case if the parameter is not set by an user.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test file without extension in AVRO format, and new test for reading the file with and wihout specified schema.","created_at":"2018-07-14T11:00:41Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:01Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T21:39:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11835fa0e073badef7d10693a0a375ad36f0f15e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/85cdf871ab31d9fada6280917a66557c98938f3c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-without-extension","ref":"avro-without-extension","sha":"85cdf871ab31d9fada6280917a66557c98938f3c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince Spark has provided fairly clear interfaces for adding user-defined optimization rules, it would be nice to have an easy-to-use interface for excluding an optimization rule from the Spark query optimizer as well.\r\n\r\nThis would make customizing Spark optimizer easier and sometimes could debugging issues too.\r\n\r\n- Add a new config spark.sql.optimizer.excludedRules, with the value being a list of rule names separated by comma.\r\n- Modify the current batches method to remove the excluded rules from the default batches. Log the rules that have been excluded.\r\n- Split the existing default batches into \"post-analysis batches\" and \"optimization batches\" so that only rules in the \"optimization batches\" can be excluded.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a new test suite:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPropose new APIs and modify job/task scheduling to support barrier execution mode, which requires all tasks in a same barrier stage start at the same time, and retry all tasks in case some tasks fail in the middle. The barrier execution mode is useful for some ML/DL workloads.\r\n\r\nThe proposed API changes include:\r\n\r\n- `RDDBarrier` that marks an RDD as barrier (Spark must launch all the tasks together for the current stage).\r\n- `BarrierTaskContext` that support global sync of all tasks in a barrier stage, and provide extra `BarrierTaskInfo`s.\r\n\r\nIn DAGScheduler, we retry all tasks of a barrier stage in case some tasks fail in the middle, this is achieved by unregistering map outputs for a shuffleId (for ShuffleMapStage) or clear the finished partitions in an active job (for ResultStage).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd `RDDBarrierSuite` to ensure we convert RDDs correctly;\r\nAdd new test cases in `DAGSchedulerSuite` to ensure we do task scheduling correctly;\r\nAdd new test cases in `SparkContextSuite` to ensure the barrier execution mode actually works (both under local mode and local cluster mode).\r\nAdd new test cases in `TaskSchedulerImplSuite` to ensure we schedule tasks for barrier taskSet together.","created_at":"2018-07-13T05:23:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T17:50:20Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T19:12:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eccdb5c36c1e5b9b31023b48ef91959a8227d4a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7600c24221d29fde31dca921d9d5863af2666e9","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:barrier-execution-mode","ref":"barrier-execution-mode","sha":"c7600c24221d29fde31dca921d9d5863af2666e9","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the current master, `EnsureRequirements` sets the number of exchanges in `ExchangeCoordinator` before `ReuseExchange`. Then, `ReuseExchange` removes some duplicate exchange and the actual number of registered exchanges changes. Finally, the assertion in `ExchangeCoordinator` fails because the logical number of exchanges and the actual number of registered exchanges become different;\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/ExchangeCoordinator.scala#L201\r\n\r\nThis pr fixed the issue and the code to reproduce this is as follows;\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SET spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1\")\r\nscala> val df =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24788\r\n\r\nAdd a special case for unresolved expressions when constructing toString for `RelationalGroupedDataset`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe `.toString` method on `RelationalGroupedDataset` currently accesses the datatype of all of the grouping expressions.\r\n\r\nWhen these are anonymous references (ie. `col(\"name\")` or `'name`) they are created as `UnresolvedAttribute`.\r\n\r\nThis causes an exception due to this implementation of `NamedAttribute`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/unresolved.scala#L105\r\n\r\nMy fix skips the datatype part of the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21495 the welcome message is printed first, and then Scala prompt will be shown before the Spark UI info is printed.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's a minor issue, but visually, it doesn't look as nice as the existing behavior. This PR intends to fix it by duplicating the Scala `process` code to arrange the printing order. However, one variable is private, so reflection has to be used which is not desirable. \r\n\r\nWe can use this PR to brainstorm how to handle it properly and how Scala can change their APIs to fit our need.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport client mode for the Kubernetes scheduler.\r\n\r\nClient mode works more or less identically to cluster mode. However, in client mode, the Spark Context needs to be manually bootstrapped with certain properties which would have otherwise been set up by spark-submit in cluster mode. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- If the user doesn't provide a driver pod name, we don't add an owner reference. This is for usage when the driver is not running in a pod in the cluster. In such a case, the driver can only provide a best effort to clean up the executors when the driver exits, but cleaning up the resources is not guaranteed. The executor JVMs should exit if the driver JVM exits, but the pods will still remain in the cluster in a COMPLETED or FAILED state.\r\n- The user must provide a host (spark.driver.host) and port (spark.driver.port) that the executors can connect to. When using spark-submit in cluster mode, spark-submit generates the headless service automatically; in client mode, the user is responsible for setting up their own connectivity.\r\n\r\nWe also change the authentication configuration prefixes for client mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdding an integration test to exercise client mode support.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-11T18:02:55Z","updated_at":"2018-07-29T20:31:13Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T18:12:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2aa2ef9f86f3aad82c4bc34b8e54482933f9e46a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ded1ff6081da6f0b3879f6bf63b73caf01983bea","head":{"label":"palantir:k8s-client-mode","ref":"k8s-client-mode","sha":"ded1ff6081da6f0b3879f6bf63b73caf01983bea","user":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30919203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkxOTIwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"palantir/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStreaming queries with watermarks do not work with Trigger.Once because of the following. \r\n- Watermark is updated in the driver memory after a batch completes, but it is persisted to checkpoint (in the offset log) only when the next batch is planned\r\n- In trigger.once, the query terminated as soon as one batch has completed. Hence, the updated watermark is never persisted anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution is to persist the updated watermark value in the commit log when a batch is marked as completed. Then the next batch, in the next trigger.once run can pick it up from the commit log.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nnew unit tests \r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Tathagata Das

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we use a reference from Dataset in filter or sort, which was not used in the prior select, an AnalysisException occurs, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq((\"test1\", 0), (\"test2\", 1)).toDF(\"name\", \"id\")\r\ndf.select(df(\"name\")).filter(df(\"id\") === 0).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Resolved attribute(s) id#6 missing from name#5 in operator !Filter (id#6 = 0).;;\r\n!Filter (id#6 = 0)\r\n   +- AnalysisBarrier\r\n      +- Project [name#5]\r\n         +- Project [_1#2 AS name#5, _2#3 AS id#6]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n```\r\nThis change updates the rule `ResolveMissingReferences` so `Filter` and `Sort` with non-empty `missingInputs` will also be transformed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-11T09:04:38Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:49Z","closed_at":"2018-07-13T15:29:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7c8f1b4a94754785f4ebd4e5c48754400c3d694","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e00db938ddc6293899170e19b41530b22fb525a","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-24781","ref":"SPARK-24781","sha":"9e00db938ddc6293899170e19b41530b22fb525a","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn ProgressReporter for streams, we use the `committedOffsets` as the startOffset and `availableOffsets` as the end offset when reporting the status of a trigger in `finishTrigger`. This is a bad pattern that has existed since the beginning of ProgressReporter and it is bad because its super hard to reason about when `availableOffsets` and `committedOffsets` are updated, and when they are recorded. Case in point, this bug silently existed in ContinuousExecution, since before MicroBatchExecution was refactored.\r\n\r\nThe correct fix it to record the offsets explicitly. This PR adds a simple method which is explicitly called from MicroBatch/ContinuousExecition before updating the `committedOffsets`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-11T03:27:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T19:48:43Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T19:48:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6e3713b6011c1a9c3f98d5493e833b1ab4a4c64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/81e8955243ce9ce553b71cd40010dff998279626","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-24697","ref":"SPARK-24697","sha":"81e8955243ce9ce553b71cd40010dff998279626","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nApache Avro (https://avro.apache.org) is a popular data serialization format. It is widely used in the Spark and Hadoop ecosystem, especially for Kafka-based data pipelines.  Using the external package https://github.com/databricks/spark-avro, Spark SQL can read and write the avro data. Making spark-Avro built-in can provide a better experience for first-time users of Spark SQL and structured streaming. We expect the built-in Avro data source can further improve the adoption of structured streaming. \r\nThe proposal is to inline code from spark-avro package (https://github.com/databricks/spark-avro). The target release is Spark 2.4.  \r\n\r\n[Built-in AVRO Data Source In Spark 2.4.pdf](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/2181511/Built-in.AVRO.Data.Source.In.Spark.2.4.pdf)\r\n\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the group state of user-defined-type is encoded as top-level columns in the UnsafeRows stores in the state store. The timeout timestamp is also saved as (when needed) as the last top-level column. Since the group state is serialized to top-level columns, you cannot save \"null\" as a value of state (setting null in all the top-level columns is not equivalent). So we don't let the user set the timeout without initializing the state for a key. Based on user experience, this leads to confusion.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to change the row format such that the state is saved as nested columns. This would allow the state to be set to null, and avoid these confusing corner cases.

in another way: free the `UnsafeExternalMap` when the task ends. All the data buffers in Spark SQL are using `UnsafeExternalMap` and `UnsafeExternalSorter` under the hood, e.g. sort, aggregate, window, SMJ, etc. `UnsafeExternalSorter` registers a task completion listener to free the resource, we should apply the same thing to `UnsafeExternalMap`.\r\n\r\nTODO in the next PR:\r\ndo not consume all the inputs when having limit in whole stage codegen.\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes a new flag option for stateful aggregation: remove redundant key data from value.\r\nEnabling new option runs similar with current, and uses less memory for state according to key/value fields of state operator.\r\n\r\nPlease refer below link to see detailed perf. test result: \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24763?focusedCommentId=16536539&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16536539\r\n\r\nSince the state between enabling the option and disabling the option is not compatible, the option is set to 'disable' by default (to ensure backward compatibility), and OffsetSeqMetadata would prevent modifying the option after executing query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModify unit tests to cover both disabling option and enabling option.\r\nAlso did manual tests to see whether propose patch improves state memory usage.","created_at":"2018-07-09T06:25:28Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T22:42:07Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T22:25:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9febeec0158c7490400cca02d47816e8eac0cbd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/19888abc281d7a0689bf57e4c76bda918ad9306b","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-24763","ref":"SPARK-24763","sha":"19888abc281d7a0689bf57e4c76bda918ad9306b","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkSQL doesn't support to encode `Option[Product]` as a top-level row now, because in SparkSQL entire top-level row can't be null.\r\n\r\nHowever for use cases like Aggregator, it is reasonable to use `Option[Product]` as buffer and output column types. Due to above limitation, we don't do it for now.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to encode `Option[Product]` at top-level as single struct column. So we can work around the issue that entire top-level row can't be null.\r\n\r\nTo summarize encoding of `Product` and `Option[Product]`.\r\n\r\nFor `Product`, 1. at root level, the schema is all fields are flatten it into multiple columns. The `Product ` can't be null, otherwise it throws an exception.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq((1 -> \"a\"), (2 -> \"b\")).toDF()\r\ndf.printSchema()\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- _1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |-- _2: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. At non-root level, `Product` is a struct type column.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq((1, (1 -> \"a\")), (2, (2 -> \"b\")), (3, null)).toDF()\r\ndf.printSchema()\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- _1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |-- _2: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- _1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- _2: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `Option[Product]`, 1. it was not supported at root level. After this change, it is a struct type column.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq(Some(1 -> \"a\"), Some(2 -> \"b\"), None).toDF()\r\ndf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- _1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- _2: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. At non-root level, it is also a struct type column.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq((1, Some(1 -> \"a\")), (2, Some(2 -> \"b\")), (3, None)).toDF()\r\ndf.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- _1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |-- _2: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- _1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- _2: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. For use case like Aggregator, it was not supported too. After this change, we support to use `Option[Product]` as buffer/output column type.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq(\r\n    OptionBooleanIntData(\"bob\", Some((true, 1))),\r\n    OptionBooleanIntData(\"bob\", Some((false, 2))),\r\n    OptionBooleanIntData(\"bob\", None)).toDF()\r\n\r\nval group = df\r\n    .groupBy(\"name\")\r\n    .agg(OptionBooleanIntAggregator(\"isGood\").toColumn.alias(\"isGood\"))\r\ngroup.printSchema\r\n\r\nroot                                                  \r\n |-- name: string (nullable = true)                          \r\n |-- isGood: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- _1: boolean (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- _2: integer (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe buffer and output type of `OptionBooleanIntAggregator` is both `Option[(Boolean, Int)`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-09T03:43:53Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:07Z","closed_at":"2018-11-26T03:17:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78295e09a587298aa5491ed9f9368b41f41b5555","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62fdb17b4f72d935f25041c801708e3939e16074","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-24762","ref":"SPARK-24762","sha":"62fdb17b4f72d935f25041c801708e3939e16074","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to provide a tip to user how to resolve the issue of timeout expiration for broadcast joins. In particular, they can increase the timeout via **spark.sql.broadcastTimeout** or disable the broadcast at all by setting **spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold** to `-1`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt tested manually from `spark-shell`:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.broadcastTimeout\", 1)\r\nscala> val df = spark.range(100).join(spark.range(15).as[Long].map { x =>\r\n               Thread.sleep(5000)\r\n               x\r\n            }).where(\"id = value\")\r\nscala> df.count()\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Could not execute broadcast in 1 secs.
