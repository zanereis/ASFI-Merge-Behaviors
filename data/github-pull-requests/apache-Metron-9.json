Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a follow-on to METRON-539. Currently we have Stellar functions to perform cryptographic hashing operations. It would be useful to expand this to support forensic similarity hash functions so we could compare the similarity of inputs.  I have added support in this PR for [TLSH](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh/blob/master/TLSH_CTC_final.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis fits well within the existing `HASH` abstractions.  I have expanded and generalized it in a few places, but I think it's all within the spirit of the thing.\r\n\r\nI owe a use-case driven walk-through of a demo that I designed, but haven't written up yet.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdding some docs around the requirement of an \"alert\" field on new sensors.\r\n\r\nThere's an open discussion thread [[DISCUSS] Meta alert Elasticsearch new template requirement ramifications](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/418ec07c67670f685cc42acfedde85cbd90c80301ea7819093e787f8@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E) that has at least one question about what this should look like, so feel free to chime in there.\r\n\r\nOutstanding Question\r\n* Where should this live?  I have this put up, so people can see what it says, but I'm pretty sure it should live somewhere else, under a different heading.  I'm just not sure what the best fit is.\r\n* Should additional documentation around our ES templates and other sensors requirements be added now or in the future.\r\n\r\nI'll be running the proposed curl up in full dev, so that's slightly subject to change.  Normally, updates to temples don't affect existing ES indices, but since it's a dummy field without data I cautiously expect it to function.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR improves the error handling in the REST app and adds logging to failed searches in the ElasticsearchDao.  This can be tested in full dev by executing a search against REST with a value for \"from\" that is larger than the index.  For example:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 1000000000,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"bro\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore it would just return:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"responseCode\": 500,\r\n  \"message\": \"Could not execute search\",\r\n  \"fullMessage\": \"Could not execute search\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut after this change it should instead include the root cause:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"responseCode\": 500,\r\n  \"message\": \"Could not execute search\",\r\n  \"fullMessage\": \"Result window is too large, from + size must be less than or equal to: [10000] but was [100000005]. See the scroll api for a more efficient way to request large data sets. This limit can be set by changing the [index.max_result_window] index level parameter.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere should also be the full stacktrace in /var/log/metron/metron-rest.log.  \r\n\r\nThis change should improve all error messages that are returned from REST and are not limited to this case.  I also added a unit test for the REST exception handler class.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe PR completes the MPack for Alerts UI.  This can be verified in full dev by spinning up full dev and navigating to the Alerts UI through the Metron Quick Links in Ambari.  The Alerts UI should be accessible (user/password) and function normally.  You should also be able to start/stop/restart the Alerts UI through Ambari.  Also, any changes to REST or Alerts UI config should prompt an Alerts UI restart in Ambari.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR creates an RPM for the Alerts UI.  To test, cd to metron-deployment and run `mvn clean package -Pbuild-rpms`.  This should result in \"metron-alerts-0.4.1-*.noarch.rpm\" being written to \r\npackaging/docker/rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch/metron.  This can be tested further by copying the rpm to node1 in full dev and installing with `rpm -i metron-alerts-0.4.1-*.noarch.rpm`.  This should write:\r\n\r\n- several front end assets to $METRON_HOME/web/alerts-ui\r\n- an `alerts-server.js` file to $METRON_HOME/web/expressjs\r\n- a `metron-alerts` init script to /etc/init.d/metron-alerts-ui\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR contains the Bundle system and Maven Plugin.\r\n\r\nThe bundle system and the plugin are adapted from the Apache Nifi project.  \r\n\r\n## bundles-maven-plugin\r\nThe bundles-maven-plugin is an adapted version of the jar dependency plugin whose function is to bundle a jar of jars based on the dependencies for a project.  It also creates metadata attributes.\r\nA project's jar, and it's non-provided dependency jars are place in a /lib entry in the bundle, with the bundle itself being in jar format.\r\n\r\n## bundles-lib \r\nThe bundles-lib contains the functionality required to:\r\n- discover bundles\r\n- inspect bundles for exposed extension types\r\n- load the bundles\r\n- create special class loaders for bundles\r\n- deliver instances of extension types for use\r\n\r\nNAR exposed the bundles through many classes.  I have created the BundleSystem interface to expose a more usable, simplified api for our use cases.\r\n\r\n### From the original PR for METRON-777:\r\nMetron Bundle Plugin\r\n- adaptation of the nifi plugin\r\n- more configurable wrt file extension/dependency and metadata naming\r\nbundle-lib\r\n- adaptation of nifi-nar-utils to be used outside of the nifi project\r\n- rudimentary extensibility to allow configuration and injection of service types and other things that were hard coded to nifi\r\n- refactored from File based to VFS based\r\n- rebranding to Bundle from Nar ( although the lib and the plugin allow that to be configured now )\r\n- added capability to the properties class to write to stream, adapted to uri from paths\r\n- added integration tests for hdfs\r\n- changed to be ClassIndex based instead of ServiceLoader. Service loader is slower, and Casey's ClassIndex work is great. This also removes the NAR's required manual maintenance of the service file.\r\n- refactored to use VFS to load the bundle/nar into the classloader AND to use VFS to load the dependency jars -> VFS as a composite filesystem. Thus going from NAR's 'working directory', exploded NARS to just loading the bundle/nar.\r\n\r\n## Previous Review\r\nPlease see [@mattf_apache's review](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/530/files/c5f8c34e4de8e6d456b97edd6f8a0d33b4819d69)\r\n\r\n## changes from that review\r\nI have changed the InitContext operations to have explicit builders, and made it so that creating a context can be done separately from initialization.  Two contexts can then be 'merged'.  This is to allow for the addition of new bundles after initialization.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this PR I have:\r\n- made checkstyle fixes\r\n- fixed several types\r\n- added a requested set of tests loading and executing simple interface/implementation from bundle beyond what is already in the bundle-lib tests\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n*` cd bundles-maven-plugin && mvn -q install && cd .. ` must be run once to install the maven plugin\r\n* This review is code review and test code review and running only\r\n* [Test Project](https://github.com/ottobackwards/test-bundles-plugin) can be examined as a simple example of how to create bundles.\r\n* The README.md has getting started and quickstart sections with some overview of creating by hand\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR extends the Metron Alerts GUI capabilities to do group by on Alerts Data\r\n\r\nThe PR is on top of METRON-1189\r\n\r\nThe group by buttons appear on top of the table. When user selects a group, the table view changes to a tree view with the values of the groups as the root of the tree. The individual alerts would be shown as the leaf nodes of the tree.\r\n\r\nTree view has all the following features\r\n\r\n- Search will search through all the groups\r\n- Users can click on the data  inside the table to search\r\n- Users can select and table inside tree to view the details\r\n- Users can escalate the alerts from the table inside the tree\r\n- Tree view is refreshed automatically depending on the polling setting in the settings\r\n- A cumulative score and number of alerts  in a group is shown next to group name\r\n- Table inside a group can be paginated\r\n- The column names for the alerts table in the tree can be configured via configure column pane\r\n\r\nThe table config settings is moved next to settings on the GUI as it makes more meaning there.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/30694092-29135ce4-9ef0-11e7-88d4-06fee02040bb.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/30694106-436d487a-9ef0-11e7-9f76-56b49ebd8c89.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/30694113-4c7b8ad0-9ef0-11e7-9a58-5c7988f71430.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\t\r\n\r\nE2E test cases are available to test groups functionality. From root of the project \r\n\r\n```\r\ncd metron-interface/metron-alerts\r\nsh ./scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn othere shell run the test cases\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run e2e\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the features listed in contributor comments can be verified manually \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nStandard update of the Metron version number.\r\nThere are just a couple files where I changed a 0.4.0 to 0.4.1 to make a multi-line example self-consistent, that had been poorly edited in the past (probably by me).  The rest of it is all changing \"0.4.1\" to \"0.4.2\" where needed.\r\n\r\nIf you grep for \"0.4.1\" (or rather for \"0\\\\.4\\\\.1\"), you'll find some remaining usage of 0.4.1 in documentation files, where I judged the usefulness of an example did not require updating the version number.  Also of course \"0.4.1\" persists in history and log files, and in usages related to package versions other than metron.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nMigrating the create method to not pass anything as an object array and instead to use a list.  At that point, it should all be one type going in.  Still need to spin up in fulldev to make sure nothing odd happens.\r\n\r\nRather than handle both types as noted in the JIRA, I opted to make the inputs all end up being the same (list instead of array). We control both constructions of input in the DAO, so there's no reason to dela with both.\r\n\r\nTo test, make sure both create and patch work correctly.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds the ability to escalate alerts from the Alerts UI.  This is a follow on to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/711.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested locally against full dev.  Follow the instructions in \"Development Setup\" section in \"metron-interface/metron-alerts/README.md\" to start the alerts UI.  Then in a separate session, ssh to vagrant and start the Kafka console consumer for the \"escalation\" topic.  \r\n\r\nAlerts can be escalated from 2 different views:  alerts list view and alerts detail view.  After logging in, a list of alerts will initially be displayed in a table.  Select multiple alerts with the checkboxes on the right side, then select the \"Escalate\" option from the \"Actions\" dropdown.  This will escalate these alerts by sending them to the \"escalation\" Kafka topic and update the \"alert_status\" field on these records in Elasticsearch.  Verify the alert_status column now shows \"ESCALATE\" for the selected alerts and that the alerts were produced to the Kafka console consumer.\r\n\r\nNext drill into a single alert by clicking anywhere on a row that's not a link.  This will display a separate window with that alert's details.  At the top there will be several status options that can be selected (OPEN, DISMISS, RESOLVE, ESCALATE, etc).  Selecting any of these should update the alert_status in Elasticsearch and have that status reflected in the UI.  Selecting \"ESCALATE\" should produce a message to the Kafka console consumer for that alert.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes several improvements that were needed to complete this task.  These include:\r\n\r\n- Switching the \"alert_status\" update call to use the REST layer instead of going directly against Elasticsearch.  The REST endpoint does more than just update the index so this is absolutely necessary for the system to work correctly.\r\n- Slightly refactored angular services to match the REST layer.\r\n- Changed the backend used for e2e tests from mock services to a dedicated e2e index in Elasticsearch.  I found the mock services were insufficient for testing this feature and would require a lot of work to implement the various services needed (that won't scale well as we add more search features).  I switched to a dedicated e2e ES index instead and am now leveraging the REST service as it is deployed in full dev.  I'm happy to discuss this approach as needed but I feel it's an improvement and makes writing the e2e tests easier.  Scripts and javascript functions are provided to facilitate easy setup/teardown of this index.\r\n- The indices included in the alerts UI can now be specified in an environment setting so that different indices can be configured for different environments (for example \"alerts_ui_e2e\" index is used for e2e tests).  This may not end up being the final solution but they are currently hardcoded in a javascript file and I feel this is incremental progress towards something better.\r\n\r\nThis is not ready for primetime yet so please DO NOT MERGE.  The e2e tests are still failing intermittently in unrelated tests.  I was seeing this before these changes and the switch to using REST in full dev (instead of mock services) likely made it worse.  I am still working on making this more robust and also adding documentation for the e2e testing framework.  However, the functionality is there and I wanted to give people a chance to use it, review the changes and give some initial feedback.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR introduces Management UI support for parser extensions.  It is based on the currently unmerged [PR 747](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/747), and will be rebased when that hits the feature branch.\r\n\r\nI believe that with this, we have mvp functionality with the parser extensions, as the creation of kafka topics, the availability of storm slots etc are existing issues beyond the extensions in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UI support adds a new page for listing the installed extensions and the parsers they contain, and allows the installation and removal of those extensions.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1403\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-15 at 07 10 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111551/30480791-93c0d3b6-99e9-11e7-9606-10e486183a4e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1146\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-15 at 07 10 55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111551/30480795-9b3b35dc-99e9-11e7-8b68-7fa5cdb7165e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1408\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-15 at 07 11 30\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111551/30480803-a55748bc-99e9-11e7-90d1-1aba66f205c7.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1409\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-15 at 07 11 44\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111551/30480805-a8771842-99e9-11e7-81e7-44307dbd6337.png\">\r\n<img width=\"324\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-15 at 07 11 58\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111551/30480808-aae287c4-99e9-11e7-9fa5-9793744f01a3.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1397\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-15 at 07 12 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111551/30480811-af8ddd82-99e9-11e7-9036-41efd7b0b9e1.png\">\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Build a parser extension per: https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/feature/METRON-1136-extensions-parsers/metron-maven-archetypes/metron-parser-extension-archetype/README.md\r\n\r\nround trip:\r\n- run in full dev\r\n- go to the extension page\r\n- click the add button\r\n- find the archive.tar.gz of your extension from the assembly/target\r\n- install\r\n- select the extension in the list with the checkbox\r\n- actions -> delete\r\n\r\nAfter install, the parser(s) installed with the extension will be available in the sensors list\r\nAfter install, you can create a new sensor config based on that parser\r\n\r\nYou should be able to start your parser by using the same rest ( swagger instructions )\r\nsuch as documented in the readme above.\r\n\r\n## TODO:\r\nI don't have tests for all the components\r\nI have not looked at the end to end stuff and may need help there\r\nThe install dialog needs css styling, and I need help with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1188\r\n\r\nIt also references, but does not address all, the concerns/issues brought up in this discuss thread - http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/metron-dev/201701.mbox/%3CCAPpQHK1svDAx7R-s7x2Q0kJR6=5d+KDmR6a+ZmSo-5=WCmofyQ@mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n\r\nThere are a number of issues with Ambari configuration management with the Metron configuration stored in Zookeeper. I wanted to get this PR out for discussion while I finish testing/tweaking docs around this because this is a fairly major defect. This is one part new features, one part defect fixes. Here's the quick gist:\r\n\r\n- Added ability to patch JSON configs per RFC-6902\r\n- Added ability to patch/push/pull/dump individual config types, e.g. GLOBAL, PARSERS, ENRICHMENTS, etc.\r\n- Added ability to patch/push/pull/dump individual configuration names given a specific config type, e.g. PARSERS + 'bro'\r\n- Fixed the order of operations around configuration refresh\r\n  - On first service start, these steps are performed\r\n    - push zookeeper config (initialize zookeeper configs)\r\n    - run the start/restart commands\r\n    - set \"configured\" flag so this initial setup doesn't run again\r\n  - On service start or restart\r\n     - create a patch file for the global config in /tmp\r\n     - read global config from zookeeper, apply patch via new CLI zk_load_configs.sh option (note: I am pretty print formatting the JSON on writing to Zookeeper. ConfigurationManager is a bit of a monstrosity right now, and we should probably clean it up at some point. There are still some modes (PUSH) that miss the pretty print code and I'll work to fix those up also)\r\n     - pull zookeeper config locally\r\n- Added timestamps in the \"configured\" flag files. Yes, I know you can stat a file, but I like explicitly stating in the file when Ambari suggests it wrote to disk :)\r\n- Ambari now patches configuration in an additive way. Note: Any specific configs managed by Ambari will overwrite user changes to those parameters. Here's the patch excerpt from metron_service.py\r\n```\r\npatch_template = \"\"\"\r\n  [\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/es.clustername\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{ es_cluster_name }}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/es.ip\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{ es_url }}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/es.date.format\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{es_date_format}}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/parser.error.topic\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{parser_error_topic}}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/update.hbase.table\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{update_hbase_table}}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/update.hbase.cf\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{update_hbase_cf}}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/profiler.client.period.duration\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{profiler_period_duration}}\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/profiler.client.period.duration.units\",\r\n        \"value\": \"{{profiler_period_units}}\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n- removed the global.json.j2 template file and moved a default global.json to metron-common. Modified the assembly.xml and the RPM metron.spec to included this accordingly also.\r\n- Fixed global config not updating based on Ambari parameters - look at the Metron status_params.py file to see the changes. Also updated the parameter names to be consistent and modified metron-env.xml and metron-enrichment.xml to properly include these params as well.\r\n\r\nA friendlier, detailed testing plan for this is coming very soon. Minimally, you should be able to spin up full dev without it failing. A green deployment is a major indicator we're looking good. I'm currently working through Kerberos testing and various restart combinations. Any of the parameters in that patch list above are good candidates to mess around with in Ambari to ensure they are cascaded to both Zookeeper and the local file system. Also check that any new parameters pushed from a local global.json change to Zookeeper, e.g. \"blah\" : \"bloop\", are not blown away by restarting Metron services.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Profiler MPack mistakenly uses the wrong flag/guard file to indicate that the Kafka ACL group has been setup.  Whichever component (either Profiler or Indexing) that is executed first will complete successfully.  The component to run next will not perform this setup task because the duplicated flag/guard file indicates that the setup was already completed successfully.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes in this PR enhance the existing logging to help in the future when tracking down an issue like this.  The actual fix is a one line.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo test this change, you need to kerberize and environment and then ensure that both the Profiler and Indexing topologies are successfully running and consuming data after kerberization.  \r\n\r\n- [x] Tested in Full Dev\r\n- [x] Tested in multi-node cluster

Contributor Comments\r\nMoved things from an init script to Ambari, since we manage pretty much everything through Ambari anyway.  Hive does something similar. Now, the password comes from Ambari and we're independent of the `service` command and underlying CentOS management in this realm.\r\n\r\nA couple properties are pushed to Ambari to make this easier.  Notably, it's a pain in the butt (and maybe not possible at all), to get the version of our Metron install from interrogating Ambari.  As such, it's added an invisible read-only property.  This probably has to be revisited when we support upgrades (in order to make sure that the version increments appropriately).  If this is objectionable, we may want to just hard code it and replace it when we do the overall release increments like we do the other instances.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, it would be really nice to have a version/profile/whatever of full-dev available on CentOS 7.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nBecause we put all the jars on the classpath from `$METRON_HOME/lib` via a glob, if we get the wrong order, we get classpath issues around Stopwatch (i.e. more recent guava may sneak onto the classpath first). This is non-deterministic and can cause issues randomly. Instead of a glob, we should choose one of the uber jars with all the metron Stellar functions baked in and allow users to provide any extra directories we should include via an env variable. Also, we are not pulling the full hbase classpath, so in a kerberized cluster we do not get all of the configs on the classpath, so we can't find always find tgts.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments - EC2 Deployment - Updating control_path to accommodate for Linux\r\nIn Metron 0.4.1-rc4, using \"control_path = ~/.ssh/ansible-ssh-%%C\"(amazon-ec2/ansible.cfg) in a Linux environment ( such as ClearOS release 7.4.0[ClearOS is based on CentOS] with npm 3.10.10, node 6.11.1, docker 1.12.6, mvn 3.3.9, ansible 2.2.2.0, No Vagrant) could throw the following error:\r\n```\r\n\"TASK [setup] *******************************************************************\r\nfatal: [ec2-xx-yy-0-130.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com]: UNREACHABLE! => {\"changed\": false, \"msg\": \"Failed to connect to the host via ssh: percent_expand: unknown key %C\\r\\n\", \"unreachable\": true}\" \r\n```\r\nI noticed the line was formally \"control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%p-%%r\" (which worked for the Linux env above)] was changed to \"control_path = ~/.ssh/ansible-ssh-%%C\"\r\n\r\nThis PR is to change the line to \"control_path = ~/.ssh/ansbile-ssh-%%h-%%r\" to make amazon-ec2 also potentially deployable with Linux while preserving a small path length. \r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to resolve the path length issue as described in the following links:\r\nhttp://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_configuration.html  - see control_path\r\nhttps://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/11536#issuecomment-153030743 - using

Problem\r\n\r\nAfter running the Ambari Kerberization process on a cluster where Metron was installed with the MPack, often times the Kerberization process would complete successfully, but the running Metron topologies were stale and had not been restarted properly after all Kerberization steps completed.  In other cases, the Metron service check would fail when Ambari began restarting all cluster services.\r\n\r\nOne clue that this has occurred is that when querying Storm using the Thrift API to check on topology status after kerberization would result in the following error.\r\n```\r\nAuthorizationException(msg:getTopologyInfo on topology snort is not authorized)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n* All Metron services have to be started before performing a Metron service check.\r\n* All external dependencies like Storm, HBase, Kafka, etc must complete their service check before performing the service check of a Metron service having those dependencies.\r\n* Added Storm as a start dependency for the Metron Profiler.\r\n* Metron Profiler has to be stopped before Storm is stopped.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis was tested by launching the Full Dev environment, kerberizing the environment, and then monitoring the order in which each of the service start, stop and status check actions occurred.  I was not able to replicate the failure condition with this fix.","created_at":"2017-09-11T18:41:29Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T19:08:33Z","closed_at":"2017-09-13T18:28:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66d58a2c7686af0521048172543e2cb630e51774","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/f395417d1d77c8338797ece65ae68f68d5fb202a","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-1177","ref":"METRON-1177","sha":"f395417d1d77c8338797ece65ae68f68d5fb202a","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

Contributor Comments\r\nPlease see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1163 for the problem.\r\nI'm not entirely pleased with excluding 3rdpartylicenses.txt, as if it changes in future to non-empty, we could miss it.  Alternative suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nThis is required for the 0.4.1 release, else RAT doesn't pass.\r\n\r\nReproduce: \r\nThis problem seems to only reproduce when one unrolls a tarball rather than cloning from github.\r\nDo:\r\n```\r\nmkdir workdir; cd workdir\r\nwget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/metron/0.4.1-RC3/apache-metron-0.4.1-rc3.tar.gz\r\ntar xvzf apache-metron-0.4.1-rc3.tar.gz\r\ncd apache-metron-0.4.1-rc3\r\nmvn clean\r\nmvn install -DskipTests\r\n```\r\nWhen it comes to metron-alerts module, apache-rat-plugin should error, complaining about:\r\n```\r\nFiles with unapproved licenses:\r\n.../metron-interface/metron-alerts/dist/3rdpartylicenses.txt\r\n.../metron-interface/metron-alerts/dist/styles.a0b6b99c10d9a13dc67e.bundle.css\r\n```\r\nTo test the patch, while in directory apache-metron-0.4.1-rc3 do:\r\n```\r\ncurl -s -S https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12886172/METRON-1163.patch | \\\r\npatch -p 1\r\n```\r\nthen re-run the mvn command (or just do `mvn install -DskipTests -rf :metron-alerts`) and it should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdded a try-catch around the actual write that will rotate the file and try again if there's a stream closed underneath it.  Added two unit tests, one that ensures things flow through nicely to a single file with a double write and one that ensures that things flow to two files if the channel is closed underneath for whatever reason (done by just calling `closeOutputFile()` when outside of the normal flow).\r\n\r\nIt's not a perfect solution, but it should alleviate any transient pain and let us know if the problem is deeper if it keeps showing up.\r\n\r\nAlso added a missing set to a field from the constructor which probably wasn't helping things since I happened to notice it.  It's a one line change, so it seemed excessive to create a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Stellar functions accept configuration values from the Global configuration.  When using the REPL you can load the global configuration values by launching the REPL with the -z option, which loads the global configuration stored in Zookeeper.\r\n\r\nThe only way to modify the global configuration within the REPL currently is to do the following steps.\r\n1. Retrieve the global configuration with `conf := CONFIG_GET(\"global\")`\r\n2. Alter that global configuration by modifying the JSON contained in the `conf` variable.\r\n3. Push the new global configuration using `CONFIG_PUT(\"global\", conf)`\r\n4. Close and then reopen the REPL.  Without restarting the REPL the new global configuration is not loaded.\r\n\r\nI want a way to do this directly in the REPL, without restarting it, and also in a way that does not modify the persisted global configuration in Zookeeper.  I may be monkeying with something in the REPL, but I don't want to break one of my live Metron topologies.\r\n\r\n### Test Drive\r\n\r\n1. Check-out this PR and build Metron. \r\n     ```\r\n     mvn clean install -DskipTests -T1C\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n1. Then from the root of the Metron source directory, launch the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ mvn exec:java \\\r\n        -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\" \\\r\n        -pl metron-stellar/stellar-common/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Then `%define`, `%undefine`, and `%globals` to your heart's content.  There are no globals right now.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %globals\r\n    {}\r\n    ```\r\n1.  A regular assignment (my first pass at this) no longer works as expected.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %define foo=bar\r\n    [!] %define expected assignment expression\r\n    ```\r\n1. Define a simple global configuration value.  The result of the expression gets echoed just like a normal assignment expression.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %define foo := \"bar\"\r\n    bar\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Define a more complex global configuration value.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %define baz := { \"k1\": \"v1\" }\r\n    {k1=v1}\r\n    ```\r\n1. See how the globals changed.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %globals\r\n    {foo=bar, baz={k1=v1}}\r\n    ```\r\n1. Undefine a global value.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %undefine foo\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %globals\r\n    {baz={k1=v1}}\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %undefine baz\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %globals\r\n    {}\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Also works for my simple use case.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %define bootstrap.servers := \"node1:6667\"\r\n    node1:6667\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %globals\r\n    {bootstrap.servers=node1:6667}\r\n    ```\r\n**Edit:** Altered the 'Test Drive' instructions based on syntax

part of supporting parser extensions and the bundle system hosted in other applications than storm, and specifically for hosting in the rest service, we need the ability to add new bundles to the system, preferably without requiring an application restart or reloading the entire system.\r\n\r\nThe use case:\r\n\r\n1. Install a parser extension assembly from the extension ui\r\n2. switch to the sensor ui\r\n3. create new instance (+) and be able to use the parser(s) from the assembly you just installed.\r\n\r\nThis PR lays down the ground work for that capability, and will be integrated with the extension ui branch if or when taken to the Feature Branch.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I further refactor the original NIFI Nar concept of Initial Context, which is used in the BundleClassLoaders and the ExtensionManager.  I have moved the context to full classes, and moved their creation to those classes in a Builder implementation.\r\n\r\nThis allows the creation of multiple 'contexts' with different parameters and scopes.\r\nI have also added the ability to merge one context into another.\r\n\r\nThus the idea is that:\r\n- these classes have their initial context from the full scan of the bundle system library directories.\r\n- adding a new bundle means on demand creation of a new context, for just that bundle\r\n- we merge the bundles to make the new content available\r\n\r\nThe addXXXX capability is limited availability ( it is  **protected** ).\r\nIt's only public facing exposure is through the BundleSystem class.\r\n\r\nBundleSystem is the 'easy button', simplified interface to the bundles, and should be in most cases the only interface required.  Exposing it this way allows us to be sure that the ADD calls are only called in a context where we can do the type of locking we want to do.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis is a preparation PR.  The add functionality is not utilized outside the tests.\r\nSo this is a code review, no regressions check.\r\n\r\n- Build and Tests should run\r\n- Full Dev should start and have data in kibana ( no regression )\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRather subtle one here. Stellar short circuiting fails when a parenthetical boolean expression involving one boolean op is followed by the other boolean op.\r\nFor instance:\r\n* `(false && true) || true` would yield `false`, which is wrong because we're mixing `&&` and `||`.\r\n* `(false || false) || true` would yield `true`, which is correct because both ops are `||`\r\n\r\nTest this in the REPL by throwing some statements at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [ ] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is a follow up to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/717 and exposes the new Storm parser topology options in the Management UI.  This can be verified in full dev by navigating to the Management UI and editing any parser.  There should be a new \"Storm Settings\" pane in the primary panel that can be expanded and exposes input controls for all the new parser topology properties.  Editing these should successfully change the parser configs in zookeeper.\r\n\r\nI also performed a slight refactor of the Raw JSON editor to make it easier to maintain as we add more parser config properties.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

want to be able to use `PROFILER_APPLY` with live messages from a Metron cluster. For example, I would like to be able to grab 10 messages from my production Metron and then apply them in my debugger. This would be tremendously helpful for iterating between the debugger and a live cluster when troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n```\r\np := PROFILER_INIT(conf)\r\nmsgs := KAFKA_GET(\"indexing\", 10)\r\nPROFILER_APPLY(msgs, p)\r\nPROFILER_FLUSH(p)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `PROFILER_APPLY` function does not currently accept a list of messages. It accepts a String that is a JSON list, but not a Stellar list. For `PROFILER_APPLY` to play happy with `KAFKA_GET` (and other potential uses) it needs to accept a List.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `PROFILER_APPLY` rather flexible in the types of arguments that it accepts.\r\n * String containing one JSON message\r\n * String containing an array of JSON messages\r\n * List containing a JSONObject\r\n * List containing a String of one JSON message\r\n * List containing a String that is an array of JSON messages\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis can be tested by launching the REPL and running the following.\r\n\r\nCreate a Profiler definition.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n[Stellar]>>> conf\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n      \"onlyif\":

}\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a sample message.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> msg := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n[Stellar]>>> msg\r\n{\r\n  \"ip_src_addr\": \"10.0.0.1\",\r\n  \"protocol\": \"HTTPS\",\r\n

Contributor Comments\r\nThe motivation for this is also in the ticket, but the idea is that we want to be able to group alerts into a meta alert that lives and is queryable alongside the alerts from the standard sources.  These would be manually created, particularly from the UI, as a result of investigations and slicing and dicing done there.\r\n\r\nA REST API endpoint allows for the creation of a meta alert and another allows for retrieving all meta alerts associated with a given alert (by GUID).  The first is obviously directly useful, and the second is more useful for testing and validation, but may be useful in other contexts (e.g. finding events that tend to get swept up into sets of investigations).\r\n\r\nThe various search endpoints should work as expected, and be able to query on the metaalerts index.\r\n\r\nA test plan is incoming, and a couple more things need to be checked out a bit more thoroughly, but it should be pretty set for review.  If anyone is interested, it should be easy enough to spin up, use the REST APIs (both the couple small meta alert ones along with the other search ones) and interrogation of ES to see what's going on. ~It's not completely transparent, because searches against the child alerts of meta alerts need to be done against the `alert.<field>`, e.g. ` \"query\": \"alert.guid:35adafd5-ffd1-4b80-806b-91d336b87220 OR guid:35adafd5-ffd1-4b80-806b-91d336b87220\"`~ Pretty sure I made a mistake when testing this, because it worked fine in the example provided in the comments.\r\n\r\nThe basic test plan outline is going to be along the lines:\r\nSpin up full dev\r\nCreate a couple meta alerts through the REST API.\r\nEnsure they come back as expected from queries.\r\nEnsure they link up appropriately as seen from the other endpoint.\r\nEnsure the other endpoints still work as expected (e.g. search should still work, etc.)\r\n\r\nDocumentation also needs some updating and will be added (but I'll obviously take into account anything anybody wants as I write more of it).\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n* Given that these are manually created, a single index is used, rather than a timed index like for the standard alerts\r\n* Creation of meta alerts takes a map from GUID -> Index.  This is so we can do a multiget on the items, rather than trying to search through every index for them.\r\n* A list of groups is provided as metadata for the UI to be able to reproduce whatever slicing and dicing was used to group these alerts into a metaalert.  This could be extended to take arbitrary metadata, but that seems like followon.  It's possible we may want to do something akin to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/702, but I'm not familiar enough with it to say what the benefits of any synergy are.\r\n* Unfortunately, sorting has to be done on a common field. This means the metadata index is required, at index time, to populate the common field.  In our case, we use the standard threat score field. By default, the meta alerts will use the sum of the child alerts threat scores, but this can also be set via configuration to \"median\", \"min\", \"max\", \"average\", and \"count\".  All values are calculated and stored in the event that they have other interest, but can't comingle with standard alerts.\r\n  * It's possible that scripted sorting could be used to get around that limitation, but that's a potentially much larger change that interferes with existing sorting and requires appropriate construction of the script to handle.  Plus, scripting generally isn't enabled by default for security reasons, iirc.\r\n* The templates have an \"alert\" nested field added to them. To my incredible annoyance, this version of elasticsearch will fail on any searches where \"alert\" is missing rather than just consider it not found. Even though it's in a \"should\" clause.  This is improved on in 5.x, where there's a param to avoid failure.  The fields should be removed again as part of that upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

issues when programming against a live stream of data is difficult. It would be useful to have a means to run the entire threat triage process within the REPL before deploying your rule set on a Metron cluster.  This creates a set of functions to allow simulation of Threat Triage inside of the Stellar REPL.  This is useful for creating new triage rules, debugging existing triage rules, and to iterate quickly when testing rule sets.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nCreated the following new functions.\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_INIT`\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_SCORE`\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_CONFIG`\r\n\r\nModified these functions to preserve existing functionality, along with enhancing them to work with the newly created functions.\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_PRINT`\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_ADD`\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_REMOVE`\r\n   * `THREAT_TRIAGE_SET_AGGREGATOR`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThe following shows how the new functions can be used.\r\n\r\n1.

Create a few test messages to simulate your telemetry.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg1 := \"{ \\\"value\\\":22 }\"\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg1\r\n    { \"value\":22 }\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg2 := \"{ \\\"value\\\":44 }\"\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg2\r\n    { \"value\":44 }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Score a message based on the rules that have been defined.  The result allows you to see the total score, the aggregator, along with details about each rule that fired.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_SCORE( msg1, t)\r\n    {score=20.0, aggregator=MAX, rules=[{score=10.0, name=rule1, rule=value>10}, {score=20.0, name=rule2, rule=value>20}]}\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_SCORE( msg2, t)\r\n    {score=30.0, aggregator=MAX, rules=[{score=10.0, name=rule1, rule=value>10}, {score=20.0, name=rule2, rule=value>20}, {score=30.0, name=rule3, rule=value>30}]}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Now that I know the rule set has worked well, I can extract the configuration and push it into my live, Metron cluster.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := THREAT_TRIAGE_CONFIG( t)\r\n

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a regression in the REST app related to parsing sample messages with Grok.  When parsing a sample message, the REST app now stores the temporary grok pattern in HDFS instead of the local file system. \r\n\r\nThis has been tested on full dev and can be verified in a couple different ways.  The `/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/parseMessage` endpoint should now correctly parse a sample message with Grok.  For example, this request:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"sampleData\": \"1461576382.642    161 127.0.0.1 TCP_MISS/200 103701 GET http://www.cnn.com/ - DIRECT/199.27.79.73 text/html\",\r\n  \"sensorParserConfig\": {\r\n    \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.GrokParser\",\r\n    \"filterClassName\": null,\r\n    \"sensorTopic\": \"squid\",\r\n    \"writerClassName\": null,\r\n    \"errorWriterClassName\": null,\r\n    \"invalidWriterClassName\": null,\r\n    \"readMetadata\": false,\r\n    \"mergeMetadata\": false,\r\n    \"parserConfig\": {\r\n      \"grokPath\": \"./squid\",\r\n      \"patternLabel\": \"SQUID_DELIMITED\",\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fieldTransformations\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"input\": [],\r\n        \"output\": [\r\n          \"full_hostname\",\r\n          \"domain_without_subdomains\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"transformation\": \"STELLAR\",\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"full_hostname\": \"URL_TO_HOST(url)\",\r\n          \"domain_without_subdomains\": \"DOMAIN_REMOVE_SUBDOMAINS(full_hostname)\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"grokStatement\": \"SQUID_DELIMITED %{NUMBER:timestamp}[^0-9]*%{INT:elapsed} %{IP:ip_src_addr} %{WORD:action}/%{NUMBER:code} %{NUMBER:bytes} %{WORD:method} %{NOTSPACE:url}[^0-9]*(%{IP:ip_dst_addr})?\\n\\n\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould now properly return a parsed message.  This can also be verified with the management UI by editing a parser of type Grok (squid for example) and testing sample data in the Grok editor pane.\r\n\r\nI also removed the \"grok.path.default\" property from REST because it was no longer being used.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWith the addition of geohashes, to do analytics like tracking the statistical distribution of the distances of a user's login against the centroid of the user logins across some time, there is a need to be able to store sets (e.g. sets of geohashes) and multisets (sets with multiplicity) in a way that they can be stored by the profiler and merged across time.\r\nThis JIRA should add:\r\n* SET_INIT\r\n* SET_ADD\r\n* SET_REMOVE\r\n* SET_MERGE\r\n* MULTISET_INIT\r\n* MULTISET_ADD\r\n* MULTISET_REMOVE\r\n* MULTISET_MERGE\r\n* MULTISET_TO_SET\r\nThese follow the pattern of the other data structures (that are not stellar language primitives)\r\n\r\nYou can tinker with these in the stellar REPL as manual tests.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a simple variable mis-naming error which doesn't cause any immediate problems, but prevents the stack advisor running properly, which can prevent subsequent component installs.\r\n\r\nTo recreate, install a metron cluster, then attempt to install another component. The next button in the ambari wizard will remain disabled on master selection, and the request history will show a 500 error on the stack advisor step. This fix solves the problem.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

have found that it can be very natural for a new Profiler user to attempt to reference a field defined in a telemetry message, in a Profile's `groupBy` expression.  Unfortunately, this does not work as the 'groupBy' expression runs during a flush where there is no telemetry message available.  Only specific fields including duration, result, profile, start, end, entity and any variables defined in the profile itself are available.  This behavior is documented in the README, but should be more accessible when an error occurs.\r\n\r\nFor example, this seems like a Profile that should work.  But unfortunately there is no `timestamp` variable defined when the `groupBy` expression is executed.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"profile\": \"calender-effects\",\r\n      \"onlyif\":  \"exists(ip_src_addr) and exists(timestamp)\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n      \"init\":    { \"count\": 0 },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n      \"result\":  \"count\",\r\n      \"groupBy\": [\"DAY_OF_WEEK(timestamp)\"]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this expression fails the error message looks-like the following, which is not exactly enlightening.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.ParseException: Bad 'groupBy' expression: Unexpected type: \r\nexpected=Object, \r\nactual=null, \r\nexpression=DAY_OF_WEEK(timestamp), \r\nprofile=calender-effects, \r\nentity=10.0.0.1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, additional information is provided when any Profile expression fails. \r\n* The variables that are in-scope are logged.\r\n* The exact expression that failed is logged.  Previously, for the 'init' and 'update' expressions it wasn't clear which expression failed, if the user defined multiple.\r\n\r\nThis should make it much easier to debug for a user.  The same error looks-like the following with the code change.  Notice the new `variables-available` which defines the variables that were in-scope when the expression was executed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR DefaultProfileBuilder:189 - ...\r\norg.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.ParseException: Bad 'groupBy' expression: \r\nerror='Unexpected type: expected=Object, actual=null, expression=DAY_OF_WEEK(timestamp)',

Contributor Comments\r\nFixed metron.spec and the pom.xml to now copy and generate metron-maas-service RPM.\r\n\r\n**Testing Steps**\r\n1. Go to folder `metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker`\r\n2. Run `mvn clean package -Pbuild-rpms`\r\n3. Once the command completes, go to `metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch` and the metron-maas-service RPM should be present.\r\n\r\n**Testing Done**\r\n- Verified testing steps above are working fine.\r\n- Copied metron-maas-service RPM on an openstack cluster and validated that install is going through fine.\r\n- Validated installed RPM contents as follows:\r\n```\r\n[root@metron-12 ~]# rpm -ql metron-maas-0.4.1-201708290906\r\n/usr/metron\r\n/usr/metron/0.4.1\r\n/usr/metron/0.4.1/bin\r\n/usr/metron/0.4.1/bin/maas_deploy.sh\r\n/usr/metron/0.4.1/bin/maas_service.sh\r\n/usr/metron/0.4.1/lib/metron-maas-service-0.4.1-uber.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAs it stands, stellar field transformations disallow users to set variables to null (and thus remove the field). This should be corrected. For instance,\r\n```\r\n\"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n        { \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n        ,\"output\" : [ \"new_field\", \"new_field2\"]\r\n        ,\"config\" : {\r\n          \"new_field\" : \"old_field\"\r\n         ,\"new_field2\" : \"old_field2\"\r\n         ,\"old_field\" : \"null\"\r\n         ,\"old_field2\" : \"null\"\r\n                    }\r\n        }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nshould rename \"old_field\" to \"new_field and \"old_field2\" to \"old_field2\" The current behavior is to keep all 4 fields and to not change old_field or old_field2 at all.\r\n\r\nManual testing:\r\n* Create a sensor with the field transformation above.\r\n* Send data through with `old_field` set to a value\r\n* Ensure that `old_field` does not exist in any message in the index for your sensor and it is replaced with `new_field`.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIt would be useful to maintain sensible defaults for various properties in the construction of parser topologies within the sensor parser config in zookeeper. This, along with a UI, would allow people to manage defaults per sensor in a single place. CLI should take precedent and override anything stored in zookeeper.\r\n\r\nManual testing via fulldev should focus on ensuring the following conditions hold for the properties able to be specified in the config:\r\n* Specify the property in the config.\r\n* Start parser and ensure that the property is preserved.\r\n* Specify the property via the CLI param\r\n* Start parser and ensure that the CLI param is honored\r\n\r\nThe properties able to be specified in the config are as follows: \r\n* `spoutParallelism` : The kafka spout parallelism (default to `1`).  This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `spoutNumTasks` : The number of tasks for the spout (default to `1`). This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `parserParallelism` : The parser bolt parallelism (default to `1`). This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `parserNumTasks` : The number of tasks for the parser bolt (default to `1`). This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `errorWriterParallelism` : The error writer bolt parallelism (default to `1`). This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `errorWriterNumTasks` : The number of tasks for the error writer bolt (default to `1`). This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `spoutConfig` : A map representing a custom spout config. This can be overridden on the command line.\r\n* `securityProtocol` : The security protocol to use for reading from kafka.  This can be overridden on the command line and also specified in the spout config via the `security.protocol` key.  If both are specified, then they are merged and the CLI will take precedence.\r\n* `stormConfig` : The storm config to use.  This can be overridden on the command line.  If both are specified, they are merged with CLI properties taking precedence.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the `PROFILER_APPLY` function so that multiple messages can be applied at once.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nCurrently, the REPL defines a valid zookeeper hostname is one which matches a regex rather than defining it as a hostname which is reachable by the machine. Combining this with the fact that the regex to validate the hostname is denying valid hostnames:\r\n```\r\n @Test\r\n  public void testBadPattern() throws Exception\r\n  {\r\n    Pattern validHostNamePattern = Pattern.compile(\r\n            \"^(([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\\\\\\\-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])\\\\\\\\.)\"\r\n                    + \"*([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9\\\\\\\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])$\");\r\n    Assert.assertFalse(validHostNamePattern.matcher(\"gzcf0.fold.blarg.com\").matches());\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(validHostNamePattern.matcher(\"host1\").matches());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI reimplemented the hostname validator using InetAddress, which will try to resolve the hostname rather than just use a regex.\r\n\r\nTesting this on fulldev:\r\n* Run `$METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z node1:2181` and ensure REPL starts\r\n* Run `$METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z blarginghammetronzoinkburger:2181` and ensure REPL does not start with `Zookeeper Option blarginghammetronzoinkburger is not a valid host name or ip address blarginghammetronzoinkburger:2181`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is due to an artifact of the extraction of Stellar.  We moved the location of the MaaS stellar functions to `metron-maas-service` instead of `metron-maas-common`.  The former is not on the classpath for the parsers and enrichment whereas the later is.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the workaround is to add the maas-service jar to HDFS and adjust the global config to pick it up in the classpath.  That being said, it is still a regression and it's extremely useful for MaaS functions to be available to the various places we use Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs for manual testing, I suggest going through the example in `metron-maas-service`'s `README.md`.  In addition to that, I added a reference to the MaaS stellar functions as a stellar enrichment as well.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you install the Management UI using the RPM, it will not install all of the required Node dependencies.  You have to manually run `npm install ...` to get those dependencies installed.  \r\n\r\nThis works just fine in an environment that can access the interwebs.  This does not work so well when installing in an offline environment with no interweb access.  If we package all Node dependencies in the RPM itself, this makes it much simpler to install in an offline environment.  And this, of course, will also work in an online environment and removes a manual steps.  So win, win.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this change in two ways.\r\n* I built the RPMs and then manually copied them to a raw CentOS box.  I installed Node on the box, but did not install any dependencies with NPM.  I then installed the RPMs and was able to launch the Management UI.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR exposes a way to put alerts (or any message) into a configurable escalation Kafka topic.  In summary:\r\n- Adds a \"metron_escalation_topic\" parameter to MPack and Spring property file\r\n- Provides a default value and sets up the topic upon MPack installation\r\n- Adds a new AlertController for this and future alert-related functions\r\n- Adds a producer to the Kafka service and controller\r\n- Adds and updates the appropriate unit and integration tests, including making the KafkaControllerIntegrationTest simpler\r\n- Adds documentation to the README\r\n\r\nThis can be tested in full dev with Swagger by first ensuring the \"escalation\" topic is automatically created and showing up in the list of topics (use the \"/api/v1/kafka/topic\" endpoint).  Next use \"/api/v1/alert/escalate\" endpoint in the alert-controller to escalate an alert, you should receive a 200 response code.  Finally get the latest message from the Kafka \"escalation\" topic with \"/api/v1/kafka/topic/{name}/sample\" endpoint.  You should get the same message that you escalated in the previous step.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is on top of [METRON-1068](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/699). This PR adds faceted search capabilities to the UI.\r\n\r\n- A new facet pane is added to GUI that groups data based on the following 'hard coded' fields ('source:type', 'ip_src_addr', 'ip_dst_addr', 'host', 'enrichments:geo:ip_dst_addr:country') \r\n- The count of unique values for each facet and count for individual values in facet are displayed in the UI \r\n- User can expand collapse each facet\r\n- Clicking on one of the facet value would add the facet value to search and the facet values are updated in accordance with the new search criteria\r\n- All the functionality in the search like hover delete, clear is intact\r\n- If you rename a column using the rename option in column settings the renamed field name would appear in the Facet filter as well as in the search\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/29522018-755cdbd8-86a5-11e7-87e1-5bff6db36ba7.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/29521892-ef9ff19c-86a4-11e7-9917-6a79f6ede10b.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nIf you run the metron-alerts UI using any one of the ways mentioned below you would notice that UI has a new facet pane on the left of the page and all the functionality described above should be working.\r\n\r\nThere are through E2E tests written to test the faceted seacrh functionality.\r\n\r\n**Dev:** From 'metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts' you can run `./scripts/start-dev.sh` and open the GUI at `localhost:4200`\r\n\r\n**E2E:** From 'metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts' you can run `./scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh` in one terminal and run `npm run e2e` in a seperate terminal\r\n\r\n**Deployment:** Follow the steps mentioned in [Readme](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-interface/metron-alerts#installing-on-an-existing-cluster) and you should see a login page and data being fetched from rest-api's\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Profiler needs to gracefully ignore profiles that have a bad 'init', 'update', or 'groupBy' expression.  Under certain conditions a message may not be applied to all valid profiles, due to a single bad profile.\r\n\r\nIf the Profiler is running with multiple profiles defined and one of those profiles has a Stellar expression that throws an exception for either the  'init', 'update', or 'groupBy', the current logic will not continue to attempt to apply the message to the remaining valid profiles.  Only valid profiles executed before the bad profile will have the message applied.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to check for these conditions.  This can be manually tested with either a live Profiler running in a cluster or using the Profiler debugging functions.  \r\n\r\nCreate two profiles; one that is valid and another that is invalid, like the following.  Ensure that all test messages that are sent through the Profiler, reach the `good-profile` despite the `bad-profile`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n {\r\n   \"profiles\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"profile\": \"bad-profile\",\r\n        \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"init\":   { \"x\": \"2 / 0\" },\r\n        \"update\": { \"x\": \"x + 1\" },\r\n        \"result\": \"x\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"profile\": \"good-profile\",\r\n        \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"init\":   { \"x\": \"0\" },\r\n        \"update\": { \"x\": \"x + 1\" },\r\n        \"result\": \"x\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a bug that was previously Identified by @mattf-horton \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/metron/pull/622#pullrequestreview-51351898\r\n\r\nThe 'out-of-order' logic for the `SaltyRowKeyBuilder.encode` function does not work.\r\n\r\n> If it starts out in the wrong order, say end is 1 and start is 5, won't this pair of statements result in both end and start being equal to the larger, ie 5 ? We need an intermediate variable for a binary swap!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Profiler needs to gracefully ignore profiles that have a bad 'onlyif' or 'foreach' expression.  Under certain conditions a message may not be applied to all valid profiles, due to a single bad profile.\r\n\r\nIf the Profiler is running with multiple profiles defined and one of those profiles has a Stellar expression that throws an exception for either the 'foreach' or 'onlyif', the current logic will not continue to attempt to apply the message to the remaining valid profiles.  Only valid profiles executed before the bad profile will have the message applied.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to check for these conditions.  This can be manually tested with either a live Profiler running in a cluster or using the Profiler debugging functions.  \r\n\r\nCreate two profiles; one that is valid and another that is invalid, like the following.  Ensure that all test messages that are sent through the Profiler, reach the `good-profile` despite the `bad-profile`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n {\r\n   \"profiles\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"profile\": \"bad-profile\",\r\n        \"foreach\": \"2 / 0\",\r\n        \"init\":   { \"x\": \"0\" },\r\n        \"update\": { \"x\": \"x + 1\" },\r\n        \"result\": \"x\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"profile\": \"good-profile\",\r\n        \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"init\":   { \"x\": \"0\" },\r\n        \"update\": { \"x\": \"x + 1\" },\r\n        \"result\": \"x\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are instructions for how to test using the Profiler debugging functions in the REPL. Create a Profiler with the above definition.  Copy and paste the definition above into the editor.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n[Stellar]>>> conf\r\n{\r\n   \"profiles\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"profile\": \"bad-profile\",\r\n        \"foreach\": \"2 / 0\",\r\n        \"init\":   { \"x\": \"0\" },\r\n        \"update\": { \"x\": \"x + 1\" },\r\n        \"result\": \"x\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"profile\": \"good-profile\",\r\n        \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"init\":   { \"x\": \"0\" },\r\n        \"update\": { \"x\": \"x + 1\" },\r\n        \"result\": \"x\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n }\r\n[Stellar]>>> p := PROFILER_INIT(conf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a message.  Almost any message will do.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> msg := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n[Stellar]>>> msg\r\n{\r\n  \"ip_src_addr\": \"10.0.0.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nApply the message to the profiler.  If the patch is successful it will look-like the following.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY(msg, p)\r\n2017-08-17 23:39:42,605 ERROR [AeshProcess: 4] profiler.DefaultMessageRouter: error encountered while executing profile; profile='bad-profile', error='/ by zero'\r\norg.apache.metron.profiler.StandAloneProfiler@67ea50dd\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch this would trigger the bug and the same would look-like this.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY( msg, p)\r\n[!] / by zero\r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.evaluators.ArithmeticEvaluator$ArithmeticEvaluatorFunctions.lambda$division$3(ArithmeticEvaluator.java:98)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.evaluators.ArithmeticEvaluator.evaluate(ArithmeticEvaluator.java:39)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler.lambda$exitArithExpr_div$2(StellarCompiler.java:281)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler$Expression.apply(StellarCompiler.java:160)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.BaseStellarProcessor.parse(BaseStellarProcessor.java:152)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.DefaultStellarStatefulExecutor.execute(DefaultStellarStatefulExecutor.java:160)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.DefaultStellarStatefulExecutor.execute(DefaultStellarStatefulExecutor.java:123)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.profiler.DefaultMessageRouter.route(DefaultMessageRouter.java:75)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.profiler.StandAloneProfiler.apply(StandAloneProfiler.java:71)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.profiler.client.stellar.ProfilerFunctions$ProfilerApply.apply(ProfilerFunctions.java:150)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler.lambda$exitTransformationFunc$13(StellarCompiler.java:556)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler$Expression.apply(StellarCompiler.java:160)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.BaseStellarProcessor.parse(BaseStellarProcessor.java:152)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarExecutor.execute(StellarExecutor.java:287)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell.executeStellar(StellarShell.java:364)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell.handleStellar(StellarShell.java:267)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell.execute(StellarShell.java:403)\r\n\tat org.jboss.aesh.console.AeshProcess.run(AeshProcess.java:53)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

we continue to develop more Stellar functions, the list of functions returned by `%functions` in the REPL becomes hard to grok manually.

It does not use a regular expression.  I debated with myself about which way to go and I decided that it would be easier to go this way; `%function NET` is easier than `%functions .*NET.*`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTo test the change launch the REPL.\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests\r\nmvn exec:java  -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\" -pl metron-platform/metron-enrichment\r\n```\r\nThen try-out the change to %functions.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> %functions\r\nABS, APPEND_IF_MISSING, BIN, BLOOM_ADD, BLOOM_EXISTS, BLOOM_INIT, BLOOM_MERGE, CEILING, CHOMP, CHOP, COS, COUNT_MATCHES, DAY_OF_MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, DAY_OF_YEAR, DECODE, DOMAIN_REMOVE_SUBDOMAINS, DOMAIN_REMOVE_TLD, DOMAIN_TO_TLD, ENCODE, ENDS_WITH, ENRICHMENT_EXISTS, ENRICHMENT_GET, EXP, FILL_LEFT, FILL_RIGHT, FILTER, FLOOR, FORMAT, GEO_GET, GET, GET_FIRST, GET_LAST, GET_SUPPORTED_ENCODINGS, HLLP_ADD, HLLP_CARDINALITY, HLLP_INIT, HLLP_MERGE, IN_SUBNET, IS_DATE, IS_DOMAIN, IS_EMAIL, IS_EMPTY, IS_ENCODING, IS_INTEGER, IS_IP, IS_URL, JOIN, LENGTH, LIST_ADD, LN, LOG10, LOG2, MAP, MAP_EXISTS, MAP_GET, MONTH, OUTLIER_MAD_ADD, OUTLIER_MAD_SCORE, OUTLIER_MAD_STATE_MERGE, PREPEND_IF_MISSING, PROFILER_APPLY, PROFILER_FLUSH, PROFILER_INIT, PROFILE_FIXED, PROFILE_GET, PROFILE_WINDOW, PROTOCOL_TO_NAME, REDUCE, REGEXP_GROUP_VAL, REGEXP_MATCH, ROUND, SIN, SPLIT, SQRT, STARTS_WITH, STATS_ADD, STATS_BIN, STATS_COUNT, STATS_GEOMETRIC_MEAN, STATS_INIT, STATS_KURTOSIS, STATS_MAX, STATS_MEAN, STATS_MERGE, STATS_MIN, STATS_PERCENTILE, STATS_POPULATION_VARIANCE, STATS_QUADRATIC_MEAN, STATS_SD, STATS_SKEWNESS, STATS_SUM, STATS_SUM_LOGS, STATS_SUM_SQUARES, STATS_VARIANCE, STRING_ENTROPY, SYSTEM_ENV_GET, SYSTEM_PROPERTY_GET, TAN, TO_DOUBLE, TO_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP, TO_FLOAT, TO_INTEGER, TO_LONG, TO_LOWER, TO_STRING, TO_UPPER, TRIM, URL_TO_HOST, URL_TO_PATH, URL_TO_PORT, URL_TO_PROTOCOL, WEEK_OF_MONTH, WEEK_OF_YEAR, YEAR, ZIP, ZIP_LONGEST\r\n[Stellar]>>> %functions TO\r\nDOMAIN_TO_TLD, PROTOCOL_TO_NAME, STATS_KURTOSIS, TO_DOUBLE, TO_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP, TO_FLOAT, TO_INTEGER, TO_LONG, TO_LOWER, TO_STRING, TO_UPPER, URL_TO_HOST, URL_TO_PATH, URL_TO_PORT, URL_TO_PROTOCOL\r\n[Stellar]>>> %functions NET\r\nIN_SUBNET\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a group by feature to the search REST endpoint.  This PR is fairly complex so I don't think it should be merged before a thorough discussion and review.\r\n\r\nThe following is an intentionally simple example of how group by works.  This PR exposes a new REST endpoint (\"/api/v1/search/group\") that allows a user to group results based on a field or list of fields.  For example, grouping results by a field called \"fieldA\" would be done by POSTing a GroupRequest object that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"fieldA\",\r\n      \"order\": {\r\n        \"groupOrderType\": \"term or count\",\r\n        \"sortOrder\": \"desc or asc\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"index to search\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"lucene query\",\r\n  \"scoreField\": \"score\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGrouping by multiple fields would just be a matter of adding another group object:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"fieldA\",\r\n      \"order\": {\r\n        \"groupOrderType\": \"term or count\",\r\n        \"sortOrder\": \"desc or asc\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"fieldB\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"index to search\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"lucene query\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe \"order\" property defaults to count descending so it is optional.  The groups would then be nested based on the order they appear in the list:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groupedBy\": \"fieldA\",\r\n  \"groupResults\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"fieldA value1\",\r\n      \"total\": 100,\r\n      \"groupedBy\": \"fieldB\",\r\n      \"groups\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"fieldB value1\",\r\n          \"total\": 200\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"fieldB value2\",\r\n          \"total\": 150\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    } \r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe \"scoreField\" property is also optional and can be used to calculate the sum of this field within each group.  This has been verified and tested in full dev.  For example, this search query:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"ip_src_port\",\r\n      \"order\": {\r\n        \"groupOrderType\": \"term\",\r\n        \"sortOrder\": \"asc\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"bro\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nshould return search results properly grouped by those fields.  The result should like something like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groupedBy\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n  \"groupResults\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"192.168.138.158\",\r\n      \"total\": 5140,\r\n      \"groupedBy\": \"ip_src_port\",\r\n      \"groups\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"49184\",\r\n          \"total\": 121\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"49185\",\r\n          \"total\": 113\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"49186\",\r\n          \"total\": 121\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n      \"total\": 2160,\r\n      \"groupedBy\": \"ip_src_port\",\r\n      \"groups\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"5353\",\r\n          \"total\": 670\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key\": \"50451\",\r\n          \"total\": 1490\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of outstanding issues that we need to work through before this gets merged:  \r\n\r\n- I also did a fair amount of refactoring in an attempt to make this class easier to read.  If that is not the case and the refactoring made it worse, let me know.  \r\n\r\n- It has been requested in the past and I think we definitely need more detailed documentation around this particular endpoint.  I am planning on adding some extensive documentation to this PR once we settle on an API design approach.  The alerts UI isn't quite ready for this feature so there's no rush in getting this merged.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is on top of [METRON-1068](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/699). This PR gets column names from rest-api instead of directly fetching data from ES.\r\n\r\nThis contains code changes in METRON-1068 as well. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nIf you run the metron-alerts UI using any one of the ways mentioned below you would notice that UI fetches the data from matron-rest api not from ES.\r\n\r\n**Dev:** From 'metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts' you can run `./scripts/start-dev.sh` and open the GUI at `localhost:4200`\r\n\r\n**E2E:** From 'metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts' you can run `./scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh` in one terminal and run `npm run e2e` in a seperate terminal\r\n\r\n**Deployment:** Follow the steps mentioned in [Readme](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-interface/metron-alerts#installing-on-an-existing-cluster) and you should see a login page and data being fetched from rest-api's\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdded support for fetching alerts data using metron-rest instead of fetching from ES. \r\n\r\n- Added option to proxy rest api calls to metron-rest api in alerts-server-e2e.js and alerts-server.js\r\n- Added login page since we we are using rest api time to get ourself authenticated\r\n- Added e2e tests for login page\r\n- Moved alert-source to a separate model as we get only alert-source for findone api\r\n- Changed all the field names from ES names to rest-api names\r\n- All dev and e2e test environment would be using http://node1:8082 for fetching data from rest-api\r\n\r\n*NOTE:The metadata is still fetched directly from ES and the data is still saved in browser cache. I will adress these in subsequent PR's*\r\n\r\n## Tests \r\n\r\nIf you run the metron-alerts UI using any one of the ways mentioned below you would notice that UI fetches the data from matron-rest api not from ES.\r\n\r\n**Dev:** From 'metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts' you can run ` ./scripts/start-dev.sh` and open the GUI at `localhost:4200`\r\n\r\n**E2E:**  From 'metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts' you can run `./scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh` in one terminal and run `npm run e2e` in a seperate terminal\r\n\r\n**Deployment:** Follow the steps mentioned in [Readme](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-interface/metron-alerts#installing-on-an-existing-cluster) and you should see a login page and data being fetched from rest-api's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWhen Kerberos is enabled, the REST JVM flags property is being overwritten with the jaas property.  The jaas property should be appended instead.  This can be verified in full dev by enabling Kerberos and adding a property to the \"Metron JVM flags\" setting in Ambari under the REST tab.  Running `ps -ef | grep metron-rest` on the command line should show that the added property is now present in the start command.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds an ORM framework to the REST application.  An ORM (object relational mapping) framework provides tools for mapping java objects to relational database tables.  Hibernate is probably the most well-known but is not used here because of license issues.  Eclipselink is used instead and is a suitable replacement because it is Apache license friendly.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a REST endpoint that leverages this feature.  The intention is to give reviewers some context around how and why an ORM framework is needed.  The new endpoint allows a user to persist their searches in a database and also allows an admin user to manage users' searches.  These saved searches are part of an \"AlertsProfile\" that is used in the alerts UI and will replace the current approach of persisting user data client-side.  Saved searches are highlighted here but other information can (and will) be added as needed.  For example, a user's preferred display columns are also stored in this profile.  \r\n\r\nThis can be tested in full dev as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the [alert-controller](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/alert-controller) in Swagger and login as \"user1/password\".\r\n2. Create a new profile with the [save](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/alert-controller/saveUsingPOST) function.  The actual values in the profile are not important as long as you can differentiate one profile from another.  This is the profile I used for user 1:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"savedSearches\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"user 1 search\",\r\n      \"searchRequest\": {\r\n        \"facetFields\": [\r\n          \"string\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"from\": 0,\r\n        \"indices\": [\r\n          \"string\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"query\": \"string\",\r\n        \"size\": 0\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"tableColumns\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Login as \"user2/password\" (a new incognito window in chrome will work) and create a profile.\r\n4. The [get](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/alert-controller/getUsingGET) function should return the profile of the logged in user.\r\n5. Try to execute the [getall](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/alert-controller/findAllUsingGET) or [delete](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/alert-controller/deleteUsingDELETE) functions with either user1 or user2.  You should get a 403 permission error.\r\n6. Login as \"admin/password\" in a new window.  You should now be able to execute the getall and delete functions.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple design choices I would like to highlight and get the community's feedback on:\r\n\r\n1. I chose Eclipselink because it is license friendly and used in other Apache projects.  Is this the correct replacement for Hibernate?  \r\n2. The \"savedSearches\" and \"tableColumns\" fields are persisted as JSON blobs in a single table instead of a normalized data model.  In my experience with ORM frameworks, it can sometimes be advantageous to store a serialized version in a single column as opposed to representing an entity with multiple tables.  Consider the \"tableColumns\" field.  A normalized approach would be a separate \"TableColumn\" table with a foreign key column that references the \"AlertsProfile\" table.  This is not attractive in this specific case for a couple reasons:  the \"TableColumn\" table will end up having mostly duplicate data and accessing the tables columns will only happen in one direction, you will never start with a table column and lookup an alerts profile.  The \"TableColumn\" table will grow over time, lookups will eventually become slower and database tuning will be needed.\r\n3. I took the simpler approach to securing a user's profile.  The \"id\" on the \"AlertsProfile\" table is a user's id and the REST app uses the current user's id for lookup.  The only way to get another user's profile is to be logged in as an admin user and list all profiles.  Alternatively, this could have been achieved by managing a list of \"AlertsProfile\" ACLs but I felt that was overkill.\r\n4. I added a short description and reference to Eclipselink in the REST README.  Is this sufficient documentation?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

issues when programming against a live stream of data can be difficult.  This is the primary reason that drove the creation of the REPL.  Similarly it would be useful to have a means to run a profile locally to troubleshoot, validate, or debug a profile.  Now you can, right in the REPL!\r\n\r\nThere are no external dependencies like Storm, Zookeeper or HBase, so you can develop your profiles completely disconnected from a live cluster.\r\n\r\nTake it for a test spin.  \r\n\r\n1.  Create your profiles.  For this example, In the editor copy/paste in the basic \"Hello, World\" profile.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"onlyif\":  \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.  Initialize the Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> profiler := PROFILER_INIT(conf)\r\n    [Stellar]>>> profiler\r\n    org.apache.metron.profiler.StandAloneProfiler@4f8ef473\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create some telemetry.   In the editor, copy/paste in the message JSON.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> message := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    [Stellar]>>> message\r\n    {\r\n      \"ip_src_addr\": \"10.0.0.1\",\r\n      \"protocol\": \"HTTPS\",\r\n      \"length\": \"10\",\r\n      \"bytes_in\": \"234\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Apply some telemetry messages to your profiles.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY(message, profiler)\r\n    org.apache.metron.profiler.StandAloneProfiler@4f8ef473\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY(message, profiler)\r\n    org.apache.metron.profiler.StandAloneProfiler@4f8ef473\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY(message, profiler)\r\n    org.apache.metron.profiler.StandAloneProfiler@4f8ef473\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Flush the profiles, to see what it has calculated.  The result is a list of profile measurements.  Each value is a map containing detailed information about the profile measurements that were taken.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1669628, start=1502665200000, end=1502666100000}, \r\n       profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=3, entity=10.0.0.1}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nI have added unit tests to cover all of the functionality, have tested the new Stellar functions in the REPL and have also completed a basic regression test for the Profiler itself.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nHardcoding the version of bootstrap version to  4.0.0-alpha.6\r\n\r\nBootstrap's latest version (4beta) removed some of the css files that we are using. The package.json in metron-alerts is configured to pick the latest version of Bootstrap after '4-alpha-6' of bootstrap for building the UI and hence there is a build failure. \r\n\r\nIn this PR I am hard coding the bootstrap version to '4-alpha-6'. We can move to Bootstrap 4Beta if required after fixing the failures. Also i noticed that the build version in package.json file is mentioned as 0.4.0 I corrected it to 0.4.1\r\n\r\nAfter the fix the build should be passing and metron-alerts should be functional\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR adds metron-deployment/packaging/archive, and the metron-stellar-shell module.~~\r\nThis PR adds a second archive product ( ${}-stand-alone.tar.gz ) to stellar-common.\r\n\r\nThis module packages a stellar shell environment that allows running stellar on a workstation that is not a dev/build machine, nor is a cluster node.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that a metron 'admin' may want to run stellar commands on his local machine.\r\n\r\nRemote management ( config_get etc ) and profile would be useful, but have not been included.  I do not believe it is realistic for the expected user to open firewall ports or have the 'confs' setup to have these functions work as they would on a metron cluster node.\r\n\r\nThis use case would seem to require REST support of some kind.  Maybe a /metron-interface/metron-rest-stellar module.  Or maybe when extensions come to stellar we can just do it as an extension.\r\n\r\nAlso a problem, is that there are management functions that bring in hadoop dependencies mixed in with other functions like SHELL_EDIT() that may be useful on their own.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- package\r\n~~- take /metron-deployment/packaging/archive/metron-stellar-shell/target/metron-stellar-shell-0.4.1-archive.tar.gz and unpack it in some directory~~\r\n take metron-stellar/stellar-common/target/stellar-common-0.4.1-stand-alone.tar.gz and unpack it in some directory\r\n- run it\r\n- `stellar it up\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions for reviewers\r\n- Where should the doc for this go? \r\n- What NOTICE or other Files should be in the deployed env?\r\n- Do we want to post this as a separate download?\r\n- Above questions wrt port opening and configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR adds support for Assignment to the Stellar Language.  It is dependent on [METRON-711](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/686) before it can be merged.\r\n\r\nI still need to do the doc work, and more testing.\r\n\r\n## Concept\r\n\r\n- Allow for assignment of values to variables only\r\n- Pre and Post increment and decrement for variables\r\n- Assignment both returns the assigned value AND updates the variable\r\n- VariableResolver implementation may or may not choose to support updates\r\n- The Shell handles all assignments ( foo := 'val' ) as (\"foo = 'val'\"). Exposing the whole operation to Stellar allows catching illegal values and grammar\r\n- The LambdaExpression does attempt to update variables, but this would have effect if the state was using a VariableResolver instance that supported updates AND the variable was not a 'lambda' variable.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n String expr  = \"MAP([ foo, bar, baz ], (item) -> count *= 2  )\";\r\n      Map<String,Object> map = new HashMap<String,Object>(){{\r\n        put(\"foo\",1);\r\n        put(\"bar\",1);\r\n        put(\"baz\",1);\r\n        put(\"count\", 1);\r\n      }};\r\n      for(int i = 0 ; i < 5; i++){\r\n        run(expr, map);\r\n      }\r\n      Assert.assertEquals(new DecimalFormat(\"#\").format(Math.pow(2,15)), map.get(\"count\").toString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupport for:\r\n= , +=, -=, *=,  /=, ++var, --var, var++, var--\r\n\r\n\r\n## Side effects:\r\nThis is opt-in for the resolvers.  The MapVariableResolver does NOT support update, so there is no change to Enrichment, Parsers, Profile, and Shell ( beyond what has been mentioned ). \r\n\r\n## Testing:\r\nSee BasicStellarTest:test*Assign() for some usages.\r\n\r\n- Existing profiles, enrichments, parser transforms would work\r\n- Run different statements in the shell ( including those that would have worked before like = := 6.\r\n - more to come\r\n\r\n\r\n# NOTE\r\n> this is like the rebound relationship, the PR that leads to the PR that actually lands\r\n> this issues around the variable resolvers and such will dictate a different approach\r\n\r\n> This PR is to get the concept as a proposal out for review and start the discussion.  I will start a \r\n> discuss thread as well.\r\n---------\r\n> Note: This PR resolves [METRON-693 : Stellar REPL lets reserved tokens be used as unusable variable names](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-693)  as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR changes the behavior of the Stellar Shell such that when doing variable assignments ( VAR := EXPRESSION ) that result in an exception ( foo := TO_UPPER(IN) ) do not continue to set / create foo after catching the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\n- Start the stellar shell\r\n- Execute a statement that may throw an exception, the easiest is an invalid expression like\r\n```bash\r\n> foo := TO_UPPER(IN)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Verify that there is a statement that the variable will not be set\r\n- Verify that the exception and stack is printed\r\n- Verify that the variable was not in fact set:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> %vars\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, test creating a variable, and that it is not modified\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> bar := 'one'\r\n> bar := TO_UPPER(IN)\r\n> bar\r\n> %vars\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

Contributor Comments\r\nThis does three things:\r\n1. Changes Javadoc to just plain comment.\r\n2. Fixes headers that have been affected by formatting (get rid of paragraph tags, weird formatting, and deleted spaces, etc.)\r\n3. Adds a newline after the license, before the package statement.\r\n\r\nEven though this affects a (very) large number of files, I left it as one PR.  This is mostly because even though there's many changes, the vast, vast majority are changing `/**` to `/*` and adding a newlines.  Only a couple dozen files actually have fixes beyond that.  If this is too large, too tedious, or GitHub does weird crap, let me know and I can split this up.  It was just easier when making the change to just find/replace and validate correctness afterwards.\r\n\r\nNote that the newline in 3 is to meet the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s3-source-file-structure).  This is not handled by the IDE formatter (at least in IntelliJ), unfortunately.\r\n```\r\nA source file consists of, in order:\r\n\r\n1. License or copyright information, if present\r\n2. Package statement\r\n3. Import statements\r\n4. Exactly one top-level class\r\nExactly one blank line separates each section that is present.\r\n```\r\n\r\nValidation is just opening a file and ensuring that autoformat doesn't change the license header.\r\n\r\n~I still need to spin up full dev as a precaution, but given that it's all comments and whitespace, I'm expecting no issues.~\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is a first look at the Blockly/Stellar integration with a working example.  This is POC quality code and has a long way to go.  This is just an initial preview to kick off the discussion, gather requirements, and work out a design.\r\n\r\nTo take it for a test drive, spin up full dev and bring up the Management UI.  Open the threat triage panel on the bro (or any) sensor and add the rule `EXISTS(ip_src_addr)`:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 5 21 51 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311928/28989205-8785e940-7939-11e7-87c0-957eaa959195.png)\r\n\r\nClick the Save button and then click on the block icon for the newly created rule.  This will open the Stellar Blockly editor:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 5 24 10 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311928/28989252-c0c9403a-7939-11e7-8ea7-b616fbd51a2e.png)\r\n\r\nYou will notice the rule that was just created is now represented as a series of connected blocks with the rule displayed in a text box just below.  You can edit the rule by dragging, dropping and interacting with various blocks that represent Stellar operators and functions.  Try changing the rule to `EXISTS(ip_src_addr) && IS_DOMAIN(host)` like this:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 5 33 57 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311928/28989475-1e08e8d0-793b-11e7-9115-a0b5378788ce.png)\r\n\r\nThe `&&` operator is under the **Boolean** category in the toolbox to the left.  The `IS_DOMAIN` function is under **Stellar -> Domain**.  The purple block with the value set to `host` represents a list of fields parsed from the json in the **SAMPLE** widget at the top.  This block is in the **Fields** category.  If the `host` field doesn't appear in the dropdown try getting new samples (right arrow) until you get a message that contains that field:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 5 43 59 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311928/28989668-88020284-793c-11e7-9f75-db82ce28e8a7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you get the correct Stellar statement, save the sensor config:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 5 39 25 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311928/28989596-f1a9b656-793b-11e7-9c21-97674b97de0f.png)\r\n\r\nOpen that rule again with the Blockly editor and you should see the block statement you just created:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 5 41 12 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311928/28989617-22b9dcee-793c-11e7-8e29-8d629c984098.png)\r\n\r\nThis preview contains only a subset of Stellar features and is very much incomplete.  There is much more work to do.  For this demo it is shown in context of the threat triage editor but could be used anywhere Stellar is exposed.  For now I will leave you with this and let you form your own opinions about what it should evolve to.  After people have had a chance to see it, we can continue the discussion on where this should go next.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
