What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Observation API (Scala, Java, PySpark) now returns a `Map` / `Dict`. Before, it returned `Row` simply because the metrics are (internal to Observation) retrieved from the listener as rows. Since that is hidden from the user by the Observation API, there is no need to return `Row`.\r\n\r\nWhile touching this code, this moves the unit tests from `DataFrameSuite,scala` to `DatasetSuite.scala` and from `JavaDataFrameSuite.java` to `JavaDatasetSuite.java`, which is a better place.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis simplifies the API and accessing the metrics, especially in Java. There is no need for the concept `Row` when retrieving the observation result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes the return type of `get` from `Row` to `Map` (Scala) / `Dict` (Python) and introduces `getAsJavaMap` (Java).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is tested in `DatasetSuite.SPARK-34806: observation on datasets`,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new option(run-tcp-ds-query-benchmark) in 'Run benchmarks' workflow of Github actions in order to support TPCDSQueryBenchmark. \r\nWhen this option is true, the job will populate a specific matrix with `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TPCDSQueryBenchmark` class and `\"--data-location tpcds-sf-1\"` argument which then executes the TPCDSQueryBenchmark class with the specific argument. Other benchmark classes runs in parallel from separate jobs.\r\n\r\nTo set up TPC-DS (SF=1) table data, a previous [merged PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31886/files) was referred \r\n\r\n(NOTE: Also, we need to update 'Running benchmarks in your forked repository' section of  https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html to address the new option.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support a new benchmark class(TPCDSQueryBenchmark.scala) via Github Actions. Currently [this class is excluded](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/71effba5f2f6f6e4755d0af3411d8d15d0e24577/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/benchmark/Benchmarks.scala#L100) from this feature because the current structure doesn't take an argument for a specific benchmark class. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. It's only for developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Manually tested in my fork repository\r\n- [without TPCDSQueryBenchmark(the new option value equals to 'false')](https://github.com/MyeongKim/spark/actions/runs/1065162581)\r\n- [with TPCDSQueryBenchmark(the new option value equals to 'true')](https://github.com/MyeongKim/spark/actions/runs/1065365313)\r\n\r\n2. More test cases with the combinations below\r\n\r\n| input class string | run-tcp-ds-query-benchmark flag | GA url |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLASBenchmark | false |  https://github.com/MyeongKim/spark/actions/runs/1065165135 |\r\n| org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLASBenchmark | true | https://github.com/MyeongKim/spark/actions/runs/1065369228 |\r\n| org.apache.spark.sql.* | false | https://github.com/MyeongKim/spark/actions/runs/1066119336 |\r\n| org.apache.spark.sql.* | true | https://github.com/MyeongKim/spark/actions/runs/1066398591 |\r\n\r\n3. GA produces an expected `TPCDSQueryBenchmark-results.txt` result

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30494\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new way to optimize the final query stage in AQE. We first collect the effective user-specified repartition (semantic-wise, user-specified repartition is only effective if it's the root node or under a few simple nodes), and get the required distribution for the final plan. When we optimize the final query stage, we skip certain `AQEShuffleReadRule` if it breaks the required distribution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current solution for optimizing the final query stage is pretty hacky and overkill. As an example, the newly added rule `OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions` can hardly apply as it's very common that the query plan has shuffles with origin `ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS`, which is not supported by `OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

PR cherry picks https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33235 to branch-3.2 to fix test failures introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33284.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR allows the `Project` node to host outer references in scalar subqueries when `decorrelateInnerQuery` is enabled. It is already supported by the new decorrelation framework and the `RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery` rule.\r\n\r\nNote currently by default all correlated subqueries will be decorrelated, which is not necessarily the most optimal approach. Consider `SELECT (SELECT c1) FROM t`. This should be optimized as `SELECT c1 FROM t` instead of rewriting it as a left outer join. This will be done in a separate PR to optimize correlated scalar/lateral subqueries with OneRowRelation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow more types of correlated scalar subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR allows outer query column references in the SELECT cluase of a correlated scalar subquery. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (SELECT c1) FROM t;\r\n```\r\nBefore this change:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Expressions referencing the outer query are not supported\r\noutside of WHERE/HAVING clauses\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change:\r\n```\r\n+------------------+\r\n|scalarsubquery(c1)|\r\n+------------------+\r\n|0                 |\r\n|1                 |\r\n+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests and SQL tests.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit ca348e50a4edbd857ec86e4e9693fa4bcbab54b7)\r\nSigned-off-by: allisonwang-db

exposes 2 metrics which are Dropwizard `Timer` metrics, and are named with a `millis` suffix:\r\n```\r\n    private final Timer openBlockRequestLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n    private final Timer registerExecutorRequestLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n```\r\nHowever these Dropwizard Timers by default use nanoseconds ([documentation](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.2.3/getting-started.html#timers)).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `Timer` subclass, `TimerWithCustomTimeUnit`, which accepts a `TimeUnit` at creation time and exposes timing information using this time unit when values are read. Internally, values are still stored with nanosecond-level precision. The `Timer` metrics within `ExternalBlockHandler` are updated to use the new class with milliseconds as the unit.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a user-facing change as the values of the metrics themselves have changed, to expose milliseconds instead of nanoseconds. Note that this does not affect metrics such as `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_count` or `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_rate1`, only the `Snapshot`-related metrics (`max`, `median`, percentiles, etc.). For the YARN case, these metrics are not exposed prior to 3.2, so there is no change. It was possible for the nanosecond values to be consumed by some other metrics reporter reading the Dropwizard metrics directly, but I'm not aware of any such usages, so this PR is primarily code cleanup and to make branch 3.0 match with 3.2/master.\r\n\r\nNote that this differs from the master/3.2 version (#33116) primarily because there are no changes needed in `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics`.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been updated.","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:02:59Z","updated_at":"2021-09-15T21:59:47Z","closed_at":"2021-09-15T21:59:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"103d4f472efa6213a5ef6c233da37603eb64732e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ccedc17f2ca5d78302794150811151793908c51","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-35259-ess-fix-metric-unit-prefix-branch-3.0","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-35259-ess-fix-metric-unit-prefix-branch-3.0","sha":"4ccedc17f2ca5d78302794150811151793908c51","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

exposes 3 metrics which are Dropwizard `Timer` metrics, and are named with a `millis` suffix:\r\n```\r\n    private final Timer openBlockRequestLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n    private final Timer registerExecutorRequestLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n    private final Timer finalizeShuffleMergeLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n```\r\nHowever these Dropwizard Timers by default use nanoseconds ([documentation](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.2.3/getting-started.html#timers)).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `Timer` subclass, `TimerWithCustomTimeUnit`, which accepts a `TimeUnit` at creation time and exposes timing information using this time unit when values are read. Internally, values are still stored with nanosecond-level precision. The `Timer` metrics within `ExternalBlockHandler` are updated to use the new class with milliseconds as the unit.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a user-facing change as the values of the metrics themselves have changed, to expose milliseconds instead of nanoseconds. Note that this does not affect metrics such as `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_count` or `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_rate1`, only the `Snapshot`-related metrics (`max`, `median`, percentiles, etc.). For the YARN case, these metrics are not exposed prior to 3.2, so there is no change. It was possible for the nanosecond values to be consumed by some other metrics reporter reading the Dropwizard metrics directly, but I'm not aware of any such usages, so this PR is primarily code cleanup and to make branch 3.1 match with 3.2/master.\r\n\r\nNote that this differs from the master/3.2 version (#33116) primarily because there are no changes needed in `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics`.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been updated.","created_at":"2021-07-26T15:59:55Z","updated_at":"2021-09-15T21:59:48Z","closed_at":"2021-09-15T21:59:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"871cfddad64b9de1d032c1fccc548b120485eb65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ececc53d2301903c021f50f8282d49c1a61ed197","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-35259-ess-fix-metric-unit-prefix-branch-3.1","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-35259-ess-fix-metric-unit-prefix-branch-3.1","sha":"ececc53d2301903c021f50f8282d49c1a61ed197","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSet the result to 1 when the exp with 0(or False).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, exponentiation between fractional series and bools is not consistent with pandas' behavior.\r\n```\r\n >>> pser = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan], dtype=float)\r\n >>> psser = ps.from_pandas(pser)\r\n >>> pser ** False\r\n 0 1.0\r\n 1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `RewriteDistinctAggregates` rule will rewrite distinct aggregates with extra Expand node. This causes unnecessary memory waste and performance fallback for some specific aggregates (e.g. count distinct case when).\r\n\r\nfor query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n   SELECT\r\n     cat1,\r\n     COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cond1 THEN cat2 ELSE null end) as cat2_cnt1,\r\n     COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cond2 THEN cat2 ELSE null end) as cat2_cnt2,\r\n     FROM\r\n       data\r\n     GROUP BY\r\n       key\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, we rewrite it to :\r\n\r\n```\r\nAggregate(\r\n   key = ['key]\r\n   functions = [count(if (('gid = 1) and 'casewhen1) 'cat2_1 else null),\r\n                count(if (('gid = 2) and 'casewhen2) 'cat2_2 else null)]\r\n   output = ['key, 'cat2_cnt1, 'cat2_cnt2])\r\n   Aggregate(\r\n      key = ['key, 'casewhen1, 'casewhen2, 'gid]\r\n      functions = []\r\n      output = ['key, 'casewhen1, 'casewhen2, 'gid])\r\n     Expand(\r\n        projections = [('key, 'cat1, CASE WHEN cond1 THEN cat2 ELSE null END, null, 1),\r\n                       ('key, 'cat1, 'null, CASE WHEN cond1 THEN cat2 ELSE null END, 2)]\r\n        output = ['key, 'cat1, 'casewhen1, 'casewhen2, 'gid])\r\n       LocalTableScan [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR will improve performance and reduce memory waste. And query will be rewrite to:\r\n\r\n- if # of case when expr < 64\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Aggregate(\r\n       key = ['key]\r\n       functions = [count(if (01 & 'bit_vector != 0) 0 else null),\r\n                    count(if (10 & 'bit_vector != 0) 0 else null)]\r\n       output = ['key, 'cat2_cnt1, 'cat2_cnt2])\r\n       Aggregate(\r\n          key = ['key, 'cat1]\r\n          functions = [bit_or(if (cond1) 01 else 00, if (cond2) 10 else 00)]\r\n          output = ['key, 'cat1, 'bit_vector])\r\n           LocalTableScan [...]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- if # of case when expr >= 64\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Aggregate(\r\n       key = ['key]\r\n       functions = [count(if ('sum1 >= 1) 1 else null),\r\n                    count(if ('sum2 >= 1) 1 else null)]\r\n       output = ['key, 'cat1_cnt1, 'cat1_cnt2])\r\n       Aggregate(\r\n          key = ['key, 'cat1]\r\n          functions = [sum(if (cond1) 1 else 0), sum(if (cond2) 1 else 0)]\r\n          output = ['key, 'cat1, 'sum1, 'sum2])\r\n           LocalTableScan [...]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nwe can rewrite count distinct case when more efficiently\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr is move `writer.close()` before `success = true` to ensure spill file closed before set `success = true` in `ExternalSorter.spillMemoryIteratorToDisk` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid setting `success = true` first and then failure of close spill file\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action \r\n- Add a new Test case to check `The spill file should not exists if writer close fails`\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T03:20:04Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:34:45Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T17:19:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba268c8121abffa30da6620ca20bb961b4968399","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6196f810f3fb8000b36774c5840f042fdce00819","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-36242-30","ref":"SPARK-36242-30","sha":"6196f810f3fb8000b36774c5840f042fdce00819","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr is move `writer.close()` before `success = true` to ensure spill file closed before set `success = true` in `ExternalSorter.spillMemoryIteratorToDisk` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid setting `success = true` first and then failure of close spill file\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action \r\n- Add a new Test case to check `The spill file should not exists if writer close fails`\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T03:10:20Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:34:44Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T17:18:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3bd0d8769c91ec72b5580cb1de9f6026a09e80aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/629a311f941535bda736f902ae2c76a928df238a","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-36242-3.1","ref":"SPARK-36242-3.1","sha":"629a311f941535bda736f902ae2c76a928df238a","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr is move `writer.close()` before `success = true` to ensure spill file closed before set `success = true` in `ExternalSorter.spillMemoryIteratorToDisk` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid setting `success = true` first and then failure of close spill file\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action \r\n- Add a new Test case to check `The spill file should not exists if writer close fails`\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T03:09:12Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:34:44Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T03:09:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current github actions we run TPCDSQueryTestSuite for tpcds benchmark. But it's only tested under default configurations. Since we have added the `spark.sql.join.forceApplyShuffledHashJoin` config. Now we can test all 3 join strategies in TPCDS to improve the coverage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the coverage of join strategies in the TPCDS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, only for testing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix `lint-python` to pick `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` from the environment variable first to switch the Python and explicitly specify `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` to use `python3.9` in CI.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `lint-python` uses `python3`, but it's not the one we expect in CI.\r\nAs a result, `black` check is not working.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe python3 -m black command was not found. Skipping black checks for now.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe `black` check in `lint-python` should work.","created_at":"2021-07-23T23:31:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-24T07:49:39Z","closed_at":"2021-07-24T07:49:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c18c70954dce573cc16cf27a4fb46094182192f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e519ab8ff5b0456f4a4849404e10b68d66978776","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-36279/lint-python","ref":"issues/SPARK-36279/lint-python","sha":"e519ab8ff5b0456f4a4849404e10b68d66978776","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes an issue in `ResolveAggregateFunctions` where non-aggregated nested fields in ORDER BY and HAVING are not resolved correctly. This is because nested fields are resolved as aliases that fail to be semantically equal to any grouping/aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix an analyzer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix equality comparison of unordered Categoricals.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCodes of a Categorical Series are used for Series equality comparison. However, that doesn't apply to unordered Categoricals, where the same value can have different codes in two same categories in a different order.\r\n\r\nSo we should map codes to value respectively and then compare the equality of value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nFrom:\r\n```py\r\n>>> psser1 = ps.Series(pd.Categorical(list(\"abca\")))\r\n>>> psser2 = ps.Series(pd.Categorical(list(\"bcaa\"), categories=list(\"bca\")))\r\n>>> with ps.option_context(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True):\r\n...     (psser1 == psser2).sort_index()\r\n... \r\n0     True\r\n1     True\r\n2     True\r\n3    False\r\ndtype: bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n```py\r\n>>> psser1 = ps.Series(pd.Categorical(list(\"abca\")))\r\n>>> psser2 = ps.Series(pd.Categorical(list(\"bcaa\"), categories=list(\"bca\")))\r\n>>> with ps.option_context(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True):\r\n...

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33447, where the unit test is disabled, due to failure after memory setting changed. I found the root cause is after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33447, in unit test, Spark memory page byte size is changed from `67108864` to `33554432` [1]. So the shuffled hash join build size is also changed accordingly due to [memory page byte size change](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/HashedRelation.scala#L457). Previously the unit test is checking the exact value of build size, so it no longer works. Here we change the unit test to verify the relative value of build size, and it should work.\r\n\r\n[1]: I printed out the memory page byte size explicitly in unit test - `org.apache.spark.SparkException: chengsu pageSizeBytes: 33554432!` in https://github.com/c21/spark/runs/3186680616?check_suite_focus=true .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake previously disabled unit test work.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nChanged unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroducing a limit for pending PODs (newly created/requested executors included). \r\nThis limit is global for all the resource profiles. So first we have to count all the newly created and pending PODs (decreased by the ones which requested to be deleted) then we can share the remaining pending POD slots among the resource profiles.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR dynamic allocation could request too many PODs and the K8S scheduler could be overloaded and scheduling of PODs will be affected by the load.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith new unit tests.","created_at":"2021-07-23T08:48:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T14:51:34Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T03:16:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7670b80150cc014f132b7132e73e1637e265b6e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2e78f6c08a8a066cc52123c35a5de852b92457c4","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-36052","ref":"SPARK-36052","sha":"2e78f6c08a8a066cc52123c35a5de852b92457c4","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen reading Hive table, we set the Hive column id and column name configs (`hive.io.file.readcolumn.ids` and `hive.io.file.readcolumn.names`). We should set non-partition columns (data columns) for both configs, as Spark always [appends partition columns in its own Hive reader](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/TableReader.scala#L240). The column id config has only non-partition columns, but column name config has both partition and non-partition columns. We should keep them to be consistent with only non-partition columns. This does not cause issue for public OSS Hive file format for now. But for customized internal Hive file format, it causes the issue as we are expecting these two configs to be same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the code logic to be more consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting Hive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously we blocked creating tables with the null column to follow the hive behavior in PR #28833\r\nIn this PR, I propose the restore the previous behavior to support the null column in a table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor a complex query, it's possible to generate a column with null type. If this happens to the input query of\r\nCTAS, the query will fail due to Spark doesn't allow creating a table with null type. From the user's perspective,\r\nit’s hard to figure out why the null type column is produced in the complicated query and how to fix it.\r\nSo removing this constraint is more friendly to users. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this reverts the previous behavior change in #28833, for example, below command will success after this PR\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith SPARK-34806 we can now easily add an equivalent for `Dataset.observe(Observation, Column, Column*)` to PySpark's `DataFrame` API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis further aligns the Python DataFrame API with Scala Dataset API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds the `Observation` class and the `DataFrame.observe` method.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdds test `test_observe` to `pyspark.sql.test.test_dataframe`.","created_at":"2021-07-22T19:06:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T17:39:58Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T17:39:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d982a1ec2e552175ef9e308c776e496c30153194","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90675b0d300a299a047f97274e9d0814b2366a37","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-observation-python","ref":"branch-observation-python","sha":"90675b0d300a299a047f97274e9d0814b2366a37","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOnce the shuffle is cleaned up by the `ContextCleaner`, the shuffle files are deleted by the executors. In this case, the push of the shuffle data by the executors can throw `FileNotFoundException`s because the shuffle files are deleted. When this exception is thrown from the `shuffle-block-push-thread`, it causes the executor to exit. Both the `shuffle-block-push` threads and the netty event-loops will encounter `FileNotFoundException`s in this case.  The fix here stops these threads from pushing more blocks when they encounter `FileNotFoundException`. When the exception is from the `shuffle-block-push-thread`, it will get handled and logged as warning instead of failing the executor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the bug which causes executor to exits when they are instructed to clean up shuffle data.\r\nBelow is the stacktrace of this exception:\r\n```\r\n21/06/17 16:03:57 ERROR util.SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler: Uncaught exception in thread Thread[block-push-thread-1,5,main]\r\njava.lang.Error: java.io.IOException: Error in opening FileSegmentManagedBuffer\r\n\r\n{file=********/application_1619720975011_11057757/blockmgr-560cb4cf-9918-4ea7-a007-a16c5e3a35fe/0a/shuffle_1_690_0.data, offset=10640, length=190}\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1155)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Error in opening FileSegmentManagedBuffer\\{file=*******/application_1619720975011_11057757/blockmgr-560cb4cf-9918-4ea7-a007-a16c5e3a35fe/0a/shuffle_1_690_0.data, offset=10640, length=190}\r\n\r\nat org.apache.spark.network.buffer.FileSegmentManagedBuffer.nioByteBuffer(FileSegmentManagedBuffer.java:89)\r\nat org.apache.spark.shuffle.ShuffleWriter.sliceReqBufferIntoBlockBuffers(ShuffleWriter.scala:294)\r\nat org.apache.spark.shuffle.ShuffleWriter.org$apache$spark$shuffle$ShuffleWriter$$sendRequest(ShuffleWriter.scala:270)\r\nat org.apache.spark.shuffle.ShuffleWriter.org$apache$spark$shuffle$ShuffleWriter$$pushUpToMax(ShuffleWriter.scala:191)\r\nat org.apache.spark.shuffle.ShuffleWriter$$anon$2$$anon$4.run(ShuffleWriter.scala:244)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n... 2 more\r\nCaused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: ******/application_1619720975011_11057757/blockmgr-560cb4cf-9918-4ea7-a007-a16c5e3a35fe/0a/shuffle_1_690_0.data (No such file or directory)\r\nat java.io.RandomAccessFile.open0(Native Method)\r\nat java.io.RandomAccessFile.open(RandomAccessFile.java:316)\r\nat java.io.RandomAccessFile.<init>(RandomAccessFile.java:243)\r\nat org.apache.spark.network.buffer.FileSegmentManagedBuffer.nioByteBuffer(FileSegmentManagedBuffer.java:62)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit to verify no more data is pushed when `FileNotFoundException` is encountered.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdjust `astype` of fractional Series with missing values to follow pandas.\r\n\r\nNon-goal: Adjust the issue of `astype` of Decimal Series with

when `astype` integer, while a ValueError is raised in pandas.\r\n\r\nWe ought to follow pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR extends the way to represent `delayThreshold` with ANSI interval literals for watermark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA `delayThreshold` is semantically an interval value so it's should be represented as ANSI interval literals as well as the conventional `1 second` form.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to diagnose shuffle data corruption. Basically, the diagnosis mechanism works like this:\r\nThe shuffler reader would calculate the checksum (c1) for the corrupted shuffle block and send it to the server where the block is stored. At the server, it would read back the checksum (c2) that is stored in the checksum file and recalculate the checksum (c3) for the corresponding shuffle block. Then, if c2 != c3, we suspect the corruption is caused by the disk issue. Otherwise, if c1 != c3, we suspect the corruption is caused by the network issue. Otherwise, the checksum verifies pass. In any case of the error, the cause remains unknown.\r\n\r\nAfter the shuffle reader receives the diagnosis response, it'd take the action bases on the type of cause. Only in case of the network issue, we'd give a retry. Otherwise, we'd throw the fetch failure directly. Also note that, if the corruption happens inside BufferReleasingInputStream, the reducer will throw the fetch failure immediately no matter what the cause is since the data has been partially consumed by downstream RDDs. If corruption happens again after retry, the reducer will throw the fetch failure directly this time without the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nPlease check out https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32385 to see the completed proposal of the shuffle checksum project.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nShuffle data corruption is a long-standing issue in Spark. For example, in SPARK-18105, people continually reports corruption issue. However, data corruption is difficult to reproduce in most cases and even harder to tell the root cause. We don't know if it's a Spark issue or not. With the diagnosis support for the shuffle corruption, Spark itself can at least distinguish the cause between disk and network, which is very important for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users may know the cause of the shuffle corruption after this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2021-07-21T04:23:45Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T15:26:32Z","closed_at":"2021-08-02T14:59:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fbeaa13bd0c0eda95de5eca398490d5c8a50439","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca1b058b6ccac9178859c56e2f7dd05f4ff68900","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-36206","ref":"SPARK-36206","sha":"ca1b058b6ccac9178859c56e2f7dd05f4ff68900","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding an argument `index_col` for `ps.sql` function, to preserve the index when users want.\r\n\r\nNOTE that the `reset_index()` have to be performed before using `ps.sql` with `index_col`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf\r\n   A  B\r\na  1  4\r\nb  2  5\r\nc  3  6\r\n>>> psdf_reset_index = psdf.reset_index()\r\n>>> ps.sql(\"SELECT * from {psdf_reset_index} WHERE A > 1\", index_col=\"index\")\r\n       A  B\r\nindex\r\nb      2  5\r\nc      3  6\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the index is always lost.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.sql(\"SELECT * from {psdf} WHERE A > 1\")\r\n   A  B\r\n0  2  5\r\n1  3  6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIndex is one of the key object for the existing pandas users, so we should provide the way to keep the index after computing the `ps.sql`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the new argument is added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a unit test and manually check the build pass.","created_at":"2021-07-21T04:08:21Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T09:02:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-22T08:08:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4913d4726efbb038103b729aa8ecdb66f1b4a54c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bac117c2518d1f6c35cdb3a68da939bd0640d8f","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-35809","ref":"SPARK-35809","sha":"9bac117c2518d1f6c35cdb3a68da939bd0640d8f","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2653201b0a50a651ebc0c4e1fabb47d32dee77c4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache
