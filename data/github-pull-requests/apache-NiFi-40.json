Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9688 Improves Logback shutdown handling, avoiding premature closure of the Logback context during application shutdown, and enabling log messages to be written during application termination.\r\n\r\nThe default [LogbackServletContainerInitializer](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/v_1.2.10/logback-classic/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/classic/servlet/LogbackServletContainerInitializer.java) registers a `LogbackServletContainerListener` that closes the Logback context on web application shutdown. When Jetty registers NiFi web applications, it configures the Logback initializer using the standard Java ServiceLoader. With this behavior, Jetty calls `contextDestroyed` on the Logback Listener before NiFi termination has completed. This results is missing a number of log messages when shutting down NiFi.\r\n\r\nSetting the `logbackDisableServletContainerInitializer` environment variable to `true` disables the default Logback listener registration, avoiding the premature context shutdown. Adding the `DelayingShutdownHook` to the `logback.xml` configuration allows Logback to perform a clean shutdown after NiFi termination has finished.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9724 Adds a new `set-sensitive-properties-algorithm` command to `nifi.sh` providing the ability to change the value of `nifi.sensitive.props.algorithm` in the `nifi.properties` configuration.\r\n\r\nThe command follows the same approach as the `set-sensitive-properties-key` command, reading the flow configuration location from `nifi.properties`, and using the current property value to decrypt sensitive properties present in flow configuration files. The implementation refactors the class supporting `set-sensitive-properties-key` to a new shared `FlowEncryptorCommand` class. Updates also include a new section in the Administrator's Guide describing command arguments and supported algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nUses Maven Surefire plugin to swap out the full hive-exec JAR with hive-exec:core for unit testing. This was needed to fix Github Actions builds via [NIFI-9248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9248), but there was still a missing dependency. This alleviates the need for that dependency at runtime but still provides it at test time. Also updated Hive 3 unit tests to JUnit 5.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9679 Adds a new component required permission named `access-environment-credentials` and applies the permission restriction to `AWSCredentialsProviderControllerService` and `GCPCredentialsControllerService`.\r\n\r\nBoth the AWS and GCP services include support for implicit default credentials.  When deployed with granular component restrictions, this new permission allows administrators to restrict access to service provider credentials that may be present in environment variables or default file locations.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nVarious code fixes related to Github/CI system test failures.\r\n- Capture troubleshooting data on job timeout.\r\n- Capture `maven-failsafe-plugin` output on job failure.\r\n- System test timing adjustments to reduce diagnostic noise.\r\n- Log PID on startup / shutdown to identify source of orphaned processes.\r\n- Fix for `LoadBalanceSession` handshake failure (which causes test timeouts).\r\n- Fix for `LoadBalanceSession` session wrapup (which can cause test timeouts).\r\n- Logging allowing for identification of load balance failures.\r\n- Retry NiFi process shutdown if needed during system test case teardown.\r\n- Fix logging typo.\r\n- Log IDs of both ends of LoadBalance connections (to help identify failure cases).\r\n- Retry ReportingTask query on incomplete response.\r\n- Do not mask `InterruptedException` while waiting for system test actions to complete.\r\n- Retry service queries until expected state is verified.\r\n- Short waits between actions (when needed) to allow FlowManager state to become consistent.\r\n- Comment out ReportingTask system test failures to allow NIFI-9717 to be addressed asynchronously.\r\n- Adjust system test cluster configuration to avoid test failure condition.\r\n- Adjust `logback` logging for system test profile (include timestamps).\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9711 Adds support for processing the flow configuration stored in `flow.json.gz` when running the `set-sensitive-properties-key` command.\r\n\r\nChanges for [NIFI-9069](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9069) in PR #5514 introduced support for persisting the NiFi flow configuration in both XML and JSON.\r\n\r\nUpdates to the `set-sensitive-properties-key` command support processing both the XML and JSON configuration files when found, providing compatibility with earlier versions.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9706 Adds a `SystemResourceConsideration` annotation with `SystemResource.MEMORY` to the `JoltTransformJSON` processor. The `JoltTransformJSON` processor reads the entire FlowFile content into memory prior to executing the Jolt transformation, which can result in memory errors when the object representation exceeds available heap memory.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9692 Upgrades Apache Commons Lang3 to 3.12.0 and moves version management to the root Maven configuration.\r\n\r\nNumerous modules referenced various versions of Commons Lang3 using specific version numbers. With the limited numbers of changes present in Commons Lang3 versions, maintaining a shared version at the root project level ensures consistent behavior across all modules.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include refactoring several classes in `nifi-reporting-utils` and `nifi-websocket-processors` to remove the dependency on Commons Lang3.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

To test, add multiple overlapping labels on the canvas, right click on a label below the others to open the context menu and choose `Bring to Front`. The label should now be at the top of the other overlapping labels. This label that's now at the front should be persisted even after shutting down and restarting NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-14T20:47:51Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T23:50:16Z","closed_at":"2022-03-03T23:50:16Z","merged_at":"2022-03-03T23:50:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"6cd30e3d0aa6e7f8763afc7c4cb007b322555573","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/64cd203affa4ba3ca153dfa5dd6e9e11a70a2e4d","head":{"label":"sardell:NIFI-9543","ref":"NIFI-9543","sha":"64cd203affa4ba3ca153dfa5dd6e9e11a70a2e4d","user":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":252442063,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTI0NDIwNjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"sardell/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sardell/nifi","description":"Mirror

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9681 Upgrades Apache Commons DBCP from 2.7.0 to [2.9.0](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/changes-report.html#a2.9.0) across multiple modules. The upgrade consists of removing the specific version number from individual modules and defining a dependency management section in the parent `nifi-nar-bundles` module to cover all applicable child modules. This approach also ensures that dependencies on Apache Commons DBCP exclude `commons-logging`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-14T14:11:45Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T17:30:57Z","closed_at":"2022-02-14T17:30:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a2b2f5224cecfad9efc5cbd2e8867111423c3c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/beb78295d85c9f3d321551f47c6f17894a1b59a4","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9681","ref":"NIFI-9681","sha":"beb78295d85c9f3d321551f47c6f17894a1b59a4","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9527 Upgrades `snappy-java` to 1.1.8.4 for all components using the root Maven configuration. The majority of existing components depend on version 1.1.1.3 or higher. The HBase 1 and HBase 2 client service modules, as well as the Hive 1 module depend on version 1.0.4.1.\r\n\r\nThe [snappy-java](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/Milestone.md) release notes describe changes between versions. Version 1.1.7.6 made Java 8 the minimum supported version. Version 1.1.2-RC1 notes backward compatibility to 1.0.5. More recent versions support additional native architectures.\r\n\r\nThis upgrade addresses also addresses compatibility issues when attempting to run NiFi on Java 17.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9673 Improves DBCP and HikariCP test reliability with separate random database directories and invocation of the Apache Derby shutdown command after test completion. Using a different temporary directory for the Derby log also avoids file locking issues.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include updating `DBCPServiceTest` to JUnit 5, and defining the pool name property based on component identifier in `HikariCPConnectionPool` for easier troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

The problem can be solved by replacing `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap`, which has predictable iteration order.\r\n\r\nOne can reproduce the errors as follows:\r\n1. compile `mvn install -DskipTests -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-hbase-bundle/nifi-hbase-processors -am`\r\n2. run tests with NonDex `mvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-hbase-bundle/nifi-hbase-processors edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.hbase.TestFetchHBaseRow`. One can also run the tests separately, by adding the name of the test: `mvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-hbase-bundle/nifi-hbase-processors edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.hbase.TestFetchHBaseRow#testFetchToContentWithQualifierAndValueJSON`\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This PR adds C2 heartbeat/acknowledge capabilities so it is more like a real C2 server. This work is being done in advance of NIFI-9666 and NIFI-9667 to provide C2 client capabilities to MiNiFi Java\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9655 Adds queue size debug logging to `ListenUDP` and `ListenUDPRecord` through updates to the `AbstractListenEventProcessor`.\r\n\r\nThe debug logging occurs at most once per minute. The implementation uses an `AtomicLong` to track the minimum next timestamp in milliseconds for logging, and relies on processor scheduling for logging invocation. This approach avoids running an additional thread for background logging, and expects that the processor will be scheduled more often than 60 second intervals. The implementation leverages a custom `TrackingLinkedBlockingQueue` to maintain the largest queue size over the lifecycle of the processor.  Restarting the processor resets the queue and associated largest queue size tracking.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe NiFi and NiFi Bootstrap processes both bind to random ephemeral\r\nports to allow for inter-process communication (e.g. shutdown, port,\r\nping, etc.). However, the randomness of these ephemeral ports can pose\r\nchallenges for some security policies and firewall rules.\r\n\r\nThis adds two configuration options, nifi.bootstrap.listen.port and\r\nnifi.listener.bootstrap.port, that allow an administrator to define\r\nwhich ports the two processes should bind to for this communication,\r\nmaking it easier to define security policies. The options default to\r\nzero to maintain the current ephemeral port behavior.\r\n\r\nfixes bug NIFI-6740\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-6699 Corrects handling of symbolic links for `GetSFTP` and `ListSFTP` processors, which both use the `SFTPTransfer.getListing()` method to retrieve a listing of remote file information.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior evaluates the `FileMode.Type` property of each remote file and handles all symbolic links as directories when the the calling processor has the `Follow symlink` property is enabled.  With this approach, `SFTPTransfer` adds all remote symbolic links to a list of directories selected for recursion, including symbolic links to files. The results in a `FileNotFoundException` when `SFTPTransfer` attempts to read a symbolic link file as a directory.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this problem, the remote resource filter now performs a remote `stat()` request when evaluating a symbolic link for potential inclusion as a directory to read. The `stat()` request traverses the symbolic link on the remote system and returns the associated file attributes, including directory status. This approach allows the `SFTPTransfer` remote resource filter to determine whether or not to process the symbolic link as a directory.  The additional `stat()` request is necessary because symbolic link attributes do not indicate whether the link points to a regular file or directory.\r\n\r\nThe additional `stat()` request has a potential performance impact when listing directories with large numbers of symbolic links. The `Follow symlink` property is disabled by default, so this change does not impact default processor behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include refactoring the `SFTPServer` test class now named `TestServerSFTPTransfer` to run as a unit test.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9638 is the second set of changes refactoring Google Guava references across multiple extension modules.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the changes involve updates to test classes. Several updates include updating Google Guava to 31.0.1. Additional updates include removing direct references to Google Guava classes, although the library remains a required dependency in some modules.\r\n\r\nChanges impact the following modules:\r\n\r\n- nifi-accumulo-processors\r\n  - Refactored collections references\r\n- nifi-aws-processors\r\n  - Updated unit test class\r\n- nifi-azure-bundle\r\n  - Removed direct references and upgraded transitive dependency to 31.0.1\r\n- nifi-cassandra-bundle\r\n  - Set provided scope in Processor and Services NAR modules to avoid unnecessary copies\r\n  - Set cassandra.guava.version to 19.0, which is the latest version supported in the Cassandra driver\r\n- nifi-datadog-reporting-task\r\n  - Refactored references and removed direct dependency\r\n- nifi-enrich-processors\r\n  - Refactored references and removed direct dependency\r\n- nifi-evtx-processors\r\n  - Upgraded dependency from 28.0 to 31.0.1\r\n- nifi-gcp-bundle\r\n  - Removed direct references and upgraded transitive dependency to 31.0.1\r\n- nifi-graph-processors\r\n  - Removed unused test dependency\r\n- nifi-hwx-schema-registry-bundle\r\n  - Refactored references and upgraded transitive dependency to 31.0.1\r\n- nifi-kudu-processors\r\n  - Removed direct class references to shaded class\r\n- nifi-mongo-processors\r\n  - Refactored and removed test dependency\r\n- nifi-sql-reporting-tasks\r\n  - Removed reference in test class\r\n- nifi-standard-bundle\r\n  - Upgraded transitive dependency to 31.0.1 overriding version from Apache Calcite libraries\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9649 Upgrades SLF4J from 1.7.32 to 1.7.35.\r\n\r\nPR #5440 for NIFI-9283 excluded references to Log4j 1.2 as well as the SLF4J implementation library `slf4j-log4j12`. This update to SLF4J also removes the dependency management declaration for `slf4j-log4j12` and adds it to the list of banned dependencies.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9638 Refactors and removes direct references to the Google Guava library in multiple `nifi-framework` and `nifi-standard` modules.  The majority of references consist of caching and collection utilities.  The Caffeine library provides a direct replacement for most Google Guava cache references, and standard Java Collections classes support most of the collection operations. Removing and replacing these references streamlines and simplifies dependency maintenance across updated modules.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-01T04:23:03Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T20:18:24Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T20:18:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"861bb0adeeca5bf08b36a78c6fd7646211d4360d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/b6feae2f9c18ab6128dd883484e77d44ec4c1951","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9638","ref":"NIFI-9638","sha":"b6feae2f9c18ab6128dd883484e77d44ec4c1951","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

The refactored approach preserves existing shared functionality while reducing the size of binary NAR files.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-31T21:14:30Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T18:00:53Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T18:00:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da957f77f09a71aa6f4a5494af3ff3db03e4a3e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/7213e80edfbe26744cf4c338de9cd687f1e33a64","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9610","ref":"NIFI-9610","sha":"7213e80edfbe26744cf4c338de9cd687f1e33a64","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

We are additionally bypassing Integration tests when the static CREDENTIALS_FILE is not present on the system path. This stream lines the test and prevents build issues when a credentials file is not present for the integration test. It also introduces a warning to the user when the user goes to configure the Unit parameter in the processor's UI. It looks for the a blank default value or one of the values listed in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDatum.html.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9630 Migrates the NiFi Registry REST API documentation generation from `swagger2markup-maven-plugin` to `swagger-codegen-maven-plugin`.\r\n\r\nThe [Swagger2Markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup) project is no longer maintained and the last release of the Maven plugin was in 2018.  These changes also remove the need for the `asciidoctor-maven-plugin`, which converts the documentation to HTML.  Although the styling is somewhat different, the generated HTML documentation contains the same information and the `swagger-codegen-maven-plugin` is actively maintained.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing the templates associated with the generation of other unused REST API documentation for NiFi Registry.\r\n\r\nThis migration also supports removing dependence on the read-only JCenter repository since Maven Central does not contain all of the transitive dependencies that Swagger2Markup requires.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9625 Refactors the `TestServerAndClient` class into separate unit test classes for Distributed Set Cache Server and Distributed Map Cache Server. The refactored classes leverage standard JUnit 5 `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` annotations to configure and stop server instances in a reliable manner. Additional changes include wrapping communication handling in try-finally blocks to ensure that test methods close client instances.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Works for PostgreSQL version 10+. Events include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations and are output as individual flow files ordered by the time at which the operation occurred. This processor uses a Logical Replication Connection to stream data and a SQL Connection to query system views.\r\n\r\nThis new pull request builds upon the original PR #4065, but all the code was refactored. Some improvements are:\r\n\r\n- Java best practices followed;\r\n- Optimized connection management;\r\n- Added cdc.lsn and cdc.type attributes;\r\n- Simplified change reading and decoding process;\r\n- Problematic Initial Snapshot functionality removed;\r\n- Better exception handling;\r\n- Javadoc descriptions improved;\r\n- Unit and Integration Tests created.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name

Description of PR\r\n\r\nAlter CI logic of `system-tests` such that they are only run on a schedule on the base repository.  This is to avoid resource contention caused by repo forks also scheduling system tests to run at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen we re-enable system tests to run on pushes, we might re-evaluate this approach.  It should be possible to run system tests on forks, just not on a (shared) schedule.  The situation we want to avoid is having all enabled forks (potentially hundreds) simultaneously requesting macos and linux build nodes for an operation that is expected to take ~1 hour.  Hopefully this will help the system-test suite to run with greater stability.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the potential for resource contention at 0000Z with existing forks (who have not pulled this change), adjust the daily schedule trigger time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-24T19:00:41Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T21:31:25Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T21:31:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"741d4fed54d7651ba02646ec7bbb1f4ce87bff07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/87253061a8044d5bd48ac1ae421f014996400e21","head":{"label":"greyp9:NIFI-9233","ref":"NIFI-9233","sha":"87253061a8044d5bd48ac1ae421f014996400e21","user":{"login":"greyp9","id":14890693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkwNjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14890693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9","html_url":"https://github.com/greyp9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355214969,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTUyMTQ5Njk=","name":"nifi","full_name":"greyp9/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"greyp9","id":14890693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkwNjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14890693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9","html_url":"https://github.com/greyp9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greyp9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/greyp9/nifi","description":"Apache
