were not enabled for MapState/SetState for appliance on legacy runner. Enabling tests shows that MapState wasn't conforming to the spec that a read iterator is unaffected by subsequent writes, so this was fixed. Additional tests for the new map state built on MultimapState, exposed that MultimapState had a bug with remove/put/remove/put sequence which was fixed.\r\n\r\nRelated to issue #18200 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

have been type inferencing issues with Beam YAML `MapToFields` where the type(s) from the upstream pcollection are dropped when the `beam.Select` is used on unmapped fields in the `MapToFields` expansion (i.e. when using `append: true`, the unmapped fields are mapped to AnyType). \r\n\r\nThe fix is to register type hints for the implicitly appended fields.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

we shuffle large elements on the SDK, we need to detect if the SDK is busy processing the elements or if has moved on to the next element. This helps Runners to detect if it should continue waiting for the element to be entirely read or move on to the next element. \r\n\r\nThis change is added via a capability and will be interpreted as such on the runner side. This change has been tested for different cases (throwing away of all elements, throwing away of all elements + few keys taking very long to read, normal shuffle of large elements) on the Dataflow Runner for all SDKs. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is setting pipeline options under the hood, causing potential clashes with user defined options, or when the connector is used more than once in the same pipeline (and using conflicting values).\r\n\r\nThis PR just removes the code setting the pipeline options. All tests are passing. Running this version in a job using the `readChangeStream()` connector is working fine. The only noticeable effect is that the `metadata_table` option is not set in the pipeline options.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #31411 \r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

WriteFiles, if the temp staging region/replication differs from the final output location, the rewrite operations used are not metadata operations but involve copying data.\r\n\r\nThis may be desirable to reduce replication changes as GCS bills bytes*replication for temporary files separately even if they are rewritten with a metadata rewrite op.\r\n\r\nCurrently when experimenting with this, the pipeline can fail due to read timeouts executing the rewrite op batches. Batch operations are best used for lightweight operations and I believe the timeout is occurring due to too much batching when copying data.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the lowers the batch size for rewrite operations that likely involve copying due to different buckets, as well as adding options to control the timeouts and batch size if further adjustments are needed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#31360 Add withoutValidation option to Bigtable change stream IO.\r\n\r\nThis aligns with withoutValidation of Read and Write IO. This allows users to create a pipeline without validating the correctness of the change stream configurations. This includes validating the change stream table exists, metadata table exists, metadata table is using the correct schema, and app profile used is appropriate. This allows the users to create a pipeline without Bigtable permissions locally. Bigtable permissions is still required by the pipeline itself in order to stream the table.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a build & stage to RC creation to release signed hashed and zipped prism binaries to a release.\r\n\r\nCurrently requires a release with the RC tag to exist, actually straightening out the logic is best handled in a separate PR, as this change is sufficiently complex as is without including the clobber protection logic if targetting an already published release.\r\n\r\nChanges the workflow dispatch to us a JSON object instead of individual string fields. The dialog now looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/beam/assets/13907733/768012b7-2a5c-40c7-9d08-e35fc00e99a5)\r\n\r\nNot an ideal experience, but we hit the 10 input limit otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe action syncs down the Dev Apache SVN repo, builds prism binaries for ARM64, AMD64 for Linux, Darwin (osx), and Windows, zipping up the binary, creating signature and sha512 hash files.\r\n\r\nThese are uploaded to a Github prerelease for the RC tag, like so: https://github.com/apache/beam/releases/tag/untagged-819e4037252d95b05550\r\n\r\nFinally, the same artifacts are committed to the Dev Apache repository for final publishing.\r\n\r\nSignature and hash are not included in the Zip so the archive doesn't need to be decompressed before being able to validate it.\r\n\r\nTODO in a subsequent PR:\r\n* automatically create a draft prerelease release for the tag if one doesn't exist yet.\r\n* Update existing draft GH release for the release version with the new RC tag.\r\n* Fail early if a published release has already gone out for the version to avoid clobbering an existing non-RC GH release.\r\n\r\n* Updating the Release Manager guide.\r\n\r\nPart of #29697\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`test_big_query_write_insert_non_transient_api_call_error`, we occasionally see this error:\r\n```\r\n[1m�[31mERROR   �[0m apache_beam.runners.common:bundle_processor.py:237 BigQuery job beam_bq_job_COPY_AUTOMATIC_JOB_NAME_COPY_STEP_76772e260e0c46cf96f0b94402c2595d_2af7745dca2d9060a22b202c77bbc2d8 failed. Error Result: <ErrorProto |  \r\n-- | --\r\n  | message: 'Error encountered during execution. Retrying may solve the problem.' |  \r\n  | reason: 'backendError'> [while running 'write/BigQueryBatchFileLoads/ParDo(TriggerCopyJobs)/ParDo(TriggerCopyJobs)']\r\n``` \r\nThe reason is not clear but the BQ copy job is already done although the error could be retried. To really retry this, we need to retry the entire copy job. Given `STREAMING_INSERTS` is not recommended any more, we decided to just retry the test for now.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

printing an <code>context canceled</code> spurious error when OTEL is configured. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/5044\">docker/cli#5044</a></li>\n<li>Experimental environment variable <code>DOCKER_BRIDGE_PRESERVE_KERNEL_LL=1</code> will prevent the daemon from removing the kernel-assigned link local address on a Linux bridge. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47775\">moby/moby#47775</a></li>\n<li>Resolve an issue preventing container creation on hosts with a read-only <code>/proc/sys/net</code> filesystem. If IPv6 cannot be disabled on an interface due to this, either disable IPv6 by default on the host or ensure <code>/proc/sys/net</code> is read-write. Otherwise, start dockerd with <code>DOCKER_ALLOW_IPV6_ON_IPV4_INTERFACE=1</code> to bypass the error. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47769\">moby/moby#47769</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
