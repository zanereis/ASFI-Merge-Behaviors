a ServerConnectivityException instead of a GemFireConfigException when hostname lookup fails because:\r\n\r\n1) The WAN event processor will sleep and retry on ServerConnectivityException, but will shut down due to the a GemFireConfigException.  In this case, we are dealing with an intermittent failure to lookup an IP address by hostname, so we should sleep and retry.\r\n\r\n2) ServerConnectivityException conceptually makes more sense.  GemFireConfigException is intended for issues involving configuration i.e. cache.xml.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Bill Burcham <bburcham@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Ryan McMahon <rmcmahon@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR was previously reviewed and committed as #2778. I reverted it to fix a bug in Log4jAgent#configure which was unconditionally updating the log level which resulted in commands such as validate-disk-store logging info level log statements. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n* GEODE-2644: Provide ability to configure Geode appenders in log4j2.xml\r\n* GEODE-5789: gfsh command \"change loglevel\" only updates the cache.getLogger\r\n* GEODE-5637: Flaky: SingleHopClientExecutorWithLoggingIntegrationTest fails intermittently\r\n\r\nHigh level description of these changes:\r\n\r\n1. Follow log4j2 best practices\r\nMake the Geode appenders configurable from log4j2.xml and pausable so that we can delete the majority of manipulating log4j2 core code. Geode used to dynamically add/remove appenders, now we pause/resume appenders that remain registered. Also, use log4j2 core testing JUnit Rule for integration tests involving a log4j2.xml config file.\r\n2. Make log4j2 core dependency optional\r\nReplace direct manipulation of singletons from Geode code with a simple internal LoggingSession API that makes log4j2 core optional and makes Geode logging/alerting pluggable for other logging engines such as Logback.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n```\r\nNew Appenders\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                Mode  Cnt        Score   Error

following changes were required to implement the configuration updates for a command that does not allow specifying a `--group` option.\r\n- Rename `SingleGfshCommand.updateClusterConfig` to `updateGroupConfig`, and change signature to return `boolean` instead of `void`.\r\n- Add method `SingleGfshCommand.updateAllConfigs` to support configuration updates by commands that don't recognize groups.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the proposed changes from https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2825, with the exception of adding a `ResultModel` argument to `updateClusterConfig`, which was found to not be needed.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been

UniquePortSupplier\r\ncreated by the test.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n- Convert Cargo-based tests from DUnit base class to rule-based\r\n- Start a new locator for each test\r\n- Add cargo version to

Peter Tran <ptran@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nWanted to introduce Lombok (https://projectlombok.org/) as proof-of-concept of how it can reduce the size of some classes.\r\n\r\nWe see the following advantages of using Lombok:\r\n-> Less boilerplate code.\r\n-> Can use builder pattern implicitly, which allows for much better composeability of an object.\r\n-> Increased readability\r\n\r\nMore details:
