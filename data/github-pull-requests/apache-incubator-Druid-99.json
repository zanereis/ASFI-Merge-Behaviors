this PR, I newly added two methods to ```Sequence``` for lazy evaluation of initial value of accumulation. \r\n\r\nAfter this patch, the buffer acquisition order for nested group-by query execution is changed from outer -> inner to inner -> outer. In addition, once the intermediate result of inner queries aren't needed anymore, the buffer holding it is released immediately. As a result, nested group-by queries always need at most 2 buffers.\r\n\r\n#3693 will cause some conflicts, and I believe that some changes of #3693 should also be applied to this patch.

#3799, part of #3798\r\n\r\n * Add `DimensionSelector.idLookup()` and `nameLookupPossibleInAdvance()` to allow better inspection of features `DimensionSelector`s supports, it enables safer/more correct code working with `DimensionSelector`s in `BaseTopNAlgorithm`, `BaseFilteredDimensionSpec`, `DimensionSelectorUtils`.\r\n * Add `PredicateFilteringDimensionSelector`, to make `BaseFilteredDimensionSpec` to be able to decorate `DimensionSelector`s with unknown cardinality.\r\n * Add `DimensionSelector.makeValueMatcher()` (two kinds) for `DimensionSelector`-side specifics-aware optimizations of `ValueMatcher`s. Somewhere optimization goes beyond the level we had prior to #3797.\r\n * Optimize `getRow()` in `BaseFilteredDimensionSpec`'s `DimensionSelector` (which is refactored as

for https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/3821\r\n\r\nMost major changes are done to LookupCoordinatorManager and LookupReferencesManager. This will not be backward compatible in that users will now have to specify version explicitly in addition to lookup specs when making requests for lookup adds/updates to coordinator.\r\n\r\nwhat changed?\r\n- LookupExtractorFactory.replaces(LookupExtractorFactory other) is deprecated and kept only to allow smooth transition from 0.9.x to 0.10.x\r\n- Versioning of the lookups is managed via wrapping LookupExtractorFactory and is managed by druid core. LookupReferencesManager now stores LookupExtractorFactoryContainer which is just a wrapper on LookupExtractorFactory with a version. Also Coordinator would accept LookupExtractorFactoryContainer in user requests, so user would explicitly provide a version.\r\n- Improvements to LookupCoordinatorManager loop that manages lookups\r\n- New Lookup Listener endpoint to accept request for batch add and drop of lookups\r\n- LookupReferencesManager now manages add/delete requests asynchronously in single thread\r\n- provide backward compatibility with older lookup specs stored in db, this code would read them from \"lookups\" key in config table, convert them and store them in new \"lookupsConfig\" key in the config table\r\n\r\nAlso Fixes #3975\r\n\r\nRelease Notes -\r\nAll coordinators should be stopped and then started with newer druid version. There should never be a situation where one coordinator is running 0.10.0 while other coordinator is running 0.10.1\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-17T17:01:58Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:57Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T13:41:39Z","merged_at":"2017-04-28T13:41:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"5a5a2749cdc5abe35be87d94da11802c57ffdde1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

from CalciteConnection to Planner, bringing benefits:\r\n\r\n- CalciteConnection's JDBC interface no longer sits between the SQL server\r\n  (HTTP/Avatica) and Druid's query layer. Instead, the SQL servers can use\r\n  Druid Sequence objects directly, reducing overhead in the query return path.\r\n\r\n- Implemented our own Planner-based Avatica Meta, letting us control\r\n  connection timeouts and connection / statement limits. The previous\r\n  CalciteConnection-based implementation didn't have any limits or timeouts.\r\n\r\n- The Planner interface lets us override the operator table, opening up\r\n  SQL language extensions. This patch includes two: APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT\r\n  in core, and a QUANTILE aggregator in the druid-histogram extension.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n- Added INFORMATION_SCHEMA metadata schema.\r\n\r\n- Added tests for Unicode literals and

PR builds on the work of #3766. \r\n\r\nDruid currently has the following classes to manage granularity \r\n\r\n1. Granularity - enum. Used for segments and general granularity\r\n2. QueryGranularity\r\n3. BaseQueryGranularity\r\n4. PeriodGranularity\r\n5. DurationGranularity\r\n6. AllGranularity\r\n7. NoneGranularity\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to unify the concept and share the period based Query Granularity with Segment Granularity. \r\n\r\n1. Granularity - Base class. Not an enum\r\n2. ~~QueryGranularity~~\r\n3. ~~BaseQueryGranularity~~\r\n4. PeriodGranularity - Used for segments and querying \r\n5. DurationGranularity - Only for querying. \r\n6. AllGranularity - Only for querying\r\n7. NoneGranularity - Only for querying\r\n\r\nThis unifications implies that\r\n1. `segmentGranularity` field used for ingestion can also support THIRTY_MINUTE and QUARTER.\r\n2. `queryGranularity` can be a String or a Period or a Duration. Whereas `segmentGranularity` can only be a String or a Period. We can expand `segmentGranularity` to also be represented with duration if we need to.\r\n3. `queryGranularity` when represented as string was defaulting to use `DurationGranularity`. But that has now been defaulted to use `PeriodGranularity` instead. No impact with this change.\r\n\r\nThese changes are in production running on 2bfcc8a.\r\n\r\ncc: @fjy @leventov @himanshug

```AutoStrategy``` of search query uses a cost-based planner which needs to compute the exact selectivity of the filter specified in the query. According to the result of JMC profiling, I figured out the bottleneck is calling the expensive ```union()``` operation of bitmaps. So, I propose an alternative way to estimate filter selectivity. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, I simply assumed dimension values are independent to calculate approximate selectivity. As a result, the calculated selectivity may not be exact.\r\nHowever, I think it's worthwhile because the planning cost of ```AutoStrategy``` will be reduced, thereby that strategy can be used in more cases which will be helpful for users. In addition, we can improve the selectivity estimation algorithm if it is needed.\r\n\r\nHere are some numbers.\r\n\r\n*master*\r\n```\r\nconcise bitmap\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                  (limit)  (numSegments)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt       Score      Error  Units\r\nSearchBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex    750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  463864.923 Â± 5935.667  us/op\r\nSearchBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndex   750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  471846.438 Â± 5391.567  us/op\r\n\r\nroaring bitmap\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                  (limit)  (numSegments)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt       Score       Error  Units\r\nSearchBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex    750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  803411.999 Â± 10526.744  us/op\r\nSearchBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndex   750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  807268.072 Â± 10779.393  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n*patch*\r\n```\r\nconcise bitmap\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                  (limit)  (numSegments)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt       Score      Error  Units\r\nSearchBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex    750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  301427.773 Â± 4794.298  us/op\r\nSearchBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndex   750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  285926.630 Â± 2592.590  us/op\r\n\r\nroaring bitmap\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                  (limit)  (numSegments)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt       Score      Error  Units\r\nSearchBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex    750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  464101.372 Â± 5595.434  us/op\r\nSearchBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndex   750000              1            750000           basic.B  avgt   25  466196.807 Â± 3428.533  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, you can see the overhead of selectivity estimation in the following graphs.\r\nThese graphs show the results of ```SearchBenchmark``` with the ```basic.C``` query.\r\n*- Concise bitmap*\r\n![concise](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322288/21928982/5b42d288-d9d1-11e6-95d6-6f2b8b88f80e.png)\r\n\r\n*- Roaring bitmap*\r\n![roaring](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322288/21928994/713c54d8-d9d1-11e6-9064-0a067bcae464.png)\r\n\r\nI think the overhead of selectivity estimation is acceptable.

PR adds long and float implementations of the query processing ColumnSelectorStrategy interface introduced in https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3570.\r\n\r\nThis allows users to include non-String columns as dimensions within queries by specifying a `typeHints` map in the query context. This is described in more detail in the doc changes within the PR.\r\n\r\nFor benchmarking, the patch also adds a set of \"simple\" schemas to the benchmark schemas, which has a single dimension \"dimSequential\" and a row count aggregator, where \"dimSequential\" contains an ascending sequence of integer values, encoded as String/Long/Float. Results for the benchmarks are located at:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/jon-wei/44a2b8ab97678710a9ef5b24aa107dec\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\n- When applying extraction functions to a float/long, the resulting DimensionSelector (exFns can only output Strings currently) constructs an on-the-fly dictionary without limits on memory usage, this may be problematic if an extraction function's set of output values has high cardinality. This is needed since query engines rely on the existence of a dictionary when handling Strings, I haven't thought of a better way to handle this yet.\r\n---\r\nNOTE: \r\n- Based on GroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark, there is some virtual method overhead seen in GroupBy V2, like the concern discussed in this thread: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3797#discussion_r93735214.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                                 (defaultStrategy)  (initialBuckets)  (numProcessingThreads)  (numSegments)  (queryGranularity)  (rowsPerSegment)  Mode  Cnt      Score     Error  Units\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexFloatOnly                         v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  17895.755 Â± 136.289  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexFloatThenLong                     v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  35926.555 Â± 110.157  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexFloatThenString                   v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  44480.465 Â± 398.283  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexFloatTwice                        v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  35673.128 Â±  40.837  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexLongOnly                          v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  17920.575 Â±  46.517  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexLongThenString                    v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  46077.899 Â± 470.782  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexLongThenFloat                     v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  35986.157 Â±  69.486  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexLongTwice                         v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  35938.898 Â±  70.856  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexNumericOnly                       v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  20979.666 Â±  51.640  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexNumericThenString                 v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  52961.866 Â± 438.055  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexStringOnly                        v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  22801.356 Â± 238.549  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexStringThenLong                    v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  44720.358 Â± 454.617  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexStringThenNumeric                 v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  51805.316 Â± 408.565  us/op\r\nGroupByTypeInterfaceBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndexStringTwice                       v2                -1                       4              4                 all            250000  avgt   50  46402.020 Â± 657.067  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis set of benchmarks attempts determine the running time for a group by query against single string/long/float columns (monomorphic base case), and running times for sequences of queries that use more than one type implementation.\r\n\r\nFor example, StringThenLong runs the string query followed by the long query within the same benchmark.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be some overhead when multiple type implementations are called, e.g.:\r\n\r\nLongOnly = 17920.575us\r\nStringOnly = 22801.356us\r\n\r\nwhich should sum to ~40000us for both.\r\n\r\nStringThenLong however has a running time of 444720.358us, about 10% higher than expected.\r\n\r\nThe difference bigger for NumericOnly (query on both a long and float) and NumericThenString:\r\n\r\nNumericOnly = 20979.666\r\nStringOnly = 22801.356\r\n\r\nSum should be ~44000, but NumericThenString and StringThenNumeric are 52961.866 and 51805.316 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe difference between StringOnly and StringTwice is smaller, suggesting the overhead may be related to the polymorphism. However, the behavior is not seen for long/float only, e.g. LongTwice is very close to LongThenFloat and (LongOnly + FloatOnly)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSimilar benchmarks for TopN don't show the same

(ish) to #3758 but less aggressive. This PR does _not_ change the aggregator api (they still support expressions). It also does not VCs to any new query types. It also doesn't remove makeMathExpressionSelector, but that was already done in #3815.\r\n\r\n@navis I know you commented on #3758 that you thought some of these were good ideas, and that you also had some of your own PRs you wanted to submit that would conflict. I added you as a reviewer for this, please help me out by letting me know if the stuff here is aligned with what you're doing.\r\n\r\nVirtual columns:\r\n- add long, float, dimension selectors\r\n- put cache IDs in VirtualColumnCacheHelper\r\n- adjust serde so VirtualColumns can be the holder object for Jackson\r\n- safety feature: add fail-fast validation for cycle detection and duplicates\r\n- add expression virtual column in core\r\n\r\nStorage adapters:\r\n- safety feature: move virtual column hooks before checking base columns, to prevent\r\n  surprises when a new base column is added that happens to have the same name as a\r\n  virtual column.\r\n\r\nfuture work (whoever does it) would likely involve adding virtual columns to all query types, allowing filtering on virtual columns, and allowing grouping on virtual

is part 1 of the proposal in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/druid-development/_Sd78s7yU5U/RJ8qLOJ5DwAJ. There is a net reduction in code size, I think that's a good sign!\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n- Remove ValueMatcherFactory completely.\r\n- Change `Filter.makeMatcher(ValueMatcherFactory)` to `Filter.makeMatcher(ColumnSelectorFactory)`.\r\n- Add some helper methods to Filters.java: `Filters.makeValueMatcher(ColumnSelectorFactory, String columnName, DruidPredicateFactory)` and `Filters.makeValueMatcher(ColumnSelectorFactory, String columnName, String value)`.\r\n- Did not add DimensionSelector.makeValueMatcher(value) or DimensionSelector.makeValueMatcher(predicateFactory) because benchmarks looked fine without them.\r\n\r\nAlso contained:\r\n\r\n- a bug fix in the BoundFilter; it should have treated null numbers as before all other numbers numerically, but it didn't. This was needed to help one of the tests pass.\r\n- an optimization in makeValueMatcher for columns consisting entirely of nulls.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks below. I chose FilteredAggregatorBenchmark because filtered aggregators use `Filter.makeMatcher` on both incremental and queryable indexes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster\r\n\r\nBenchmark

leadership blink causes shutting down `RemoteTaskRunner` and creating a new `RemoteTaskRunner`. But the second `RemoteTaskRunner` couldn't start, because they share global `ResourceManagementStrategy`, which shuts down it's executor when the first `RemoteTaskRunner` calls `resourceManagementStrategy.stopManagement()`.\r\n\r\n**How it is fixed**\r\n`ResourceManagementStrategy` is now an immutable object, it creates mutable stateful `ProvisioningService` objects upon request for each individual `RemoteTaskRunner`. Each `ProvisioningService` has it's own executor, which is shut down from `RemoteTaskRunner.stop()`.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nAdded `OverlordBlinkLeadershipTest`, demonstrating this issue.\r\n\r\n**What else is changed**\r\n`ResourceManagementStrategy` is refactored, first of all it is renamed to `ProvisioningStrategy` (and all related classes are renamed as well), because `Provisioning` is a little more distinctive keyword within Druid codebase than plain `ResourceManagement`.\r\n\r\nAlso `AbstractWorkerProvisioningStrategy` (former `AbstractWorkerResourceManagementStrategy`) is refactored towards composition from inheritance, `Provisioner` interface is extracted.\r\n\r\n**Size of this PR**\r\nConceptual size of this PR is smaller than you might think looking at +710 -528, e. g. in `PendingTaskBasedWorkerProvisioningStrategy` and `SimpleWorkerProvisioningStrategy.java` mostly just code indentation has changed, that generated many \"changed lines\".","created_at":"2016-12-10T02:51:11Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:52Z","closed_at":"2017-07-14T00:11:39Z","merged_at":"2017-07-14T00:11:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7203510b86d1ad512d02e49a2a82dd15e5d0db0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":632421159,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MzI0MjExNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20ZooKeeper/Curator","name":"Area

goal of this PR is to remove the `Granularity` enum which was used earlier and replace it with something more sophisticated that takes timezones into account.  Hence the new `SegmentGranularity`. The new class is modeled after `QueryGranularity`.\r\n\r\nThe earlier timezone support I created had some caveats https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3528 Timezone wasn't respected for real time and also for batch ingestion without intervals. With this change, timezone can now be enforced with segment granularity for both batch ingestion and real time ingestion. Only batch ingestion has been tested.\r\n\r\n`Granularity` had plenty of unused methods. Those have been thrown away and all its tests have been ported for `SegmentGranularity`. \r\n\r\nCore files that were added/modified:\r\n1. SegmentGranularity\r\n2. PeriodSegmentGranularity\r\n3.

this patch, virtual columns work well for aggregating, but not for grouping\r\n(because the topN and groupBy engines don't deal well with DimensionSelectors that have\r\nno dictionaries) or filtering (because the CursorFactories don't do anything useful\r\nwith them).\r\n\r\nVirtual columns:\r\n- Move VirtualColumn and related classes to their own package.\r\n- Add additional methods to VirtualColumn to support more kinds of selectors and\r\n  to support cycle detection.\r\n- Add ExpressionVirtualColumn in core, offering math expressions as a virtual column.\r\n- Put cache IDs in VirtualColumnCacheHelper.\r\n\r\nQueries:\r\n- Add VirtualColumns to timeseries, topN, and groupBy.\r\n\r\nAggregators:\r\n- Remove the \"expression\" parameter (replaced by \"expression\" virtual columns).\r\n\r\nColumnSelectorFactory:\r\n- Change getColumnCapabilities to getNativeType, since that's all anyone was using\r\n  it for, and it's simpler.\r\n- Remove \"makeMathExpressionSelector\" (replaced by \"expression\" virtual columns).\r\n\r\nStorage adapters:\r\n- Add virtual column hooks before checking base columns. I think this ordering makes\r\n  more sense than checking base columns first, since it prevents surprises when a\r\n  new base column is added that happens to have the same name as a virtual column.","created_at":"2016-12-07T15:51:44Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:52Z","closed_at":"2016-12-14T19:00:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48b37a26a7e464f5cab61c33f853b0cbe5ab7c1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null},{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/c0d6472c42bbddd5537831f912356d908b55b9d0","head":{"label":"gianm:vc-nonsense","ref":"vc-nonsense","sha":"c0d6472c42bbddd5537831f912356d908b55b9d0","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28350072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM1MDA3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"gianm/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gianm/druid","description":"RealÂ²time

inspected the graph of bitmap manipulations which are done before processing the query on Druid historical nodes and seen something like this:\r\n```\r\nunion {\r\n  intersection {\r\n    union {dimValue=14, empty=1}=1,\r\n    union {dimValue=3, empty=1}=1\r\n  }=1,\r\n  union {dimValue=7, empty=1}=1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(BTW if you want such intronspection capabilities to be commited to Druid sooner please review this: #3693)\r\n\r\nIt means that we often make unions of something + empty bitmap.\r\n\r\n**How it is fixed**\r\nOptimized `Iterator<ImmutableBitmap>` implementation inside `Filters.matchPredicate()` so that it doesn't emit empty bitmap in the end of the iteration, and make it to follow `Iterator` contract, that is throw `NoSuchElementException` from `next()` if there are no more bitmaps.\r\n\r\nBTW disadvantage of Druid's \"anonymous class style\" is that it's impossible to add tests to such anonymous interface

improvement on query benchmarks that include serde time (queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde).\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n- Remove timestamp from RowBasedKey when not needed.\r\n- Set timestamp to null in MapBasedRows that are not part of the final merge.\r\n- Added two new benchmarks, queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde (simulates serde between historical and broker) and queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSpilling (includes spilling to disk) that show the improvement here, which is mostly from having less serde work to do.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngroupby-improvements\r\n\r\nBenchmark

The error refers to a `InterfaceAudience$Public` class, which is an annotation. We probably could fix this by including hadoop-annotations jar. But, I don't want to do a patch that includes new jars so close to a release, so instead I suggest this patch which just disables javadoc generation for that class. This is against the 0.9.2 branch so we could potentially do a different approach in master.\r\n\r\nThis was not caught in the RC phase because we run \"mvn javadoc:aggregate\" there rather than \"mvn

I've seen about 200 dandling `PathChildrenCache-xx` threads in Druid thread dumps, if it doesn't take much memory and resources itself (though it could lead to memory leaks through the stacks of the worker treads), it makes long to make and harder to analyze thread dumps.\r\n\r\n**Why there was a leak**\r\nIn `SimplePathChildrenCacheFactory`, which was always used to create `PathChildrenCache` objects, `PathChildrenCache` was created using the constructor which wraps executorService with `CloseableExecutorService(executorService, shutdownOnClose=false)`. So the executorService was not shutdown, and the worker thread stay alive. BTW It means that using `ShutdownNowIgnoringExecutorService` in `Announcer` and `CuratorInventoryManager` was pointless, because nobody was trying to shutdown that executorService anyway.\r\n\r\n**What is changed**\r\n - Executors are still not shutdown from inside `PathChildrenCache`s, but they are now shutdown explicitly in `Announcer.stop()`, `CuratorInventoryManager.stop()` and `RemoteTaskRunner.stop()`.\r\n - In `RemoteTaskRunner`, moved from using separate executor (thread) for each workerStatusPath to a single executor for all of them (`workerStatusPathChildrenCacheExecutor`), because apparently what is done from them is some scheduling (no long-running tasks).\r\n - `SimplePathChildrenCacheFactory` is merged with it's interface `PathChildrenCacheFactory`, as the only used implementation (and it doesn't seem that any other implementations are needed).\r\n - Removed `ShutdownNowIgnoringExecutorService` as unused.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nI'm going to add a test which verifies that executor leak is gone in a subsequent PR on a little different
