Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\nThis is a re-PR of un-merged PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/989\r\n- (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-765)\r\n- (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-776)\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Manually tested so far. Will write unit tests once the method is reviewed.\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-18T08:43:23Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:21:32Z","closed_at":"2017-01-21T08:05:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc3b1eab617fdd9e9a61b78641813fe6a3f0a616","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/37ee9562cee3301aa7a1150c0a6676ae4524efaa","head":{"label":"aminghadersohi:master","ref":"master","sha":"37ee9562cee3301aa7a1150c0a6676ae4524efaa","user":{"login":"aminghadersohi","id":5183956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODM5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5183956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi","html_url":"https://github.com/aminghadersohi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48812161,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODgxMjE2MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"aminghadersohi/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aminghadersohi","id":5183956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODM5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5183956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi","html_url":"https://github.com/aminghadersohi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aminghadersohi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aminghadersohi/airflow","description":"Airflow

is an update to #1906 , so that it applies to current master.

delete insert sequence within one transaction can lead\r\nto a deadlocked transaction with Mariadb / MySQL.\r\n\r\nThe deletes, in case they affected no rows, all get a shared lock\r\n(mode IX) on the end-of-table gap. Once the insert is executed,\r\nthe shared lock is still held by all threads,\r\nand the insert intention waits for the release of this shared lock.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to not do the following in parallel:\r\n\r\n1. Delete the rows you want to insert, when the rows aren't there.\r\n2. Insert the rows\r\n\r\nIn this case the risk of not executing the delete and insert\r\nis relatively low, as it was the users intention to run the\r\ntask.

If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-31T18:56:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T03:06:41Z","closed_at":"2017-01-03T03:06:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b480431800aa9c5fc7df2e91b1d8e3963c23360c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1f1732a429448806b9c0dbfed83b4dfd91693e44","head":{"label":"vnomics:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f1732a429448806b9c0dbfed83b4dfd91693e44","user":{"login":"vnomics","id":16256953,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2MjU2OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16256953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics","html_url":"https://github.com/vnomics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77714615,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzcxNDYxNQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"vnomics/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vnomics","id":16256953,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2MjU2OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16256953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics","html_url":"https://github.com/vnomics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnomics/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vnomics/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- AIRFLOW-712\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-22T16:45:26Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T21:34:50Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T21:34:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8fc9ea976274e83bfdc5ba732818a9f7c3446218","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/596680cef7bd25c83e2bfe287d329b8f776e3a13","head":{"label":"criccomini:AIRFLOW-712","ref":"AIRFLOW-712","sha":"596680cef7bd25c83e2bfe287d329b8f776e3a13","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"062354de031c65f1efc0a28164d675e05e5ee02c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-703\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\nExpanded on a test case which was checking only a subset of this bug\r\n \r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs.

Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6.

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-678\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @bolkedebruin @artwr @plypaul \r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no lock/synchronization around the loop where the scheduler puts tasks in the SCHEDULED state. This means that if somehow the task starts running or gets SCHEDULED somewhere else somehow (e.g. manually running a task via the webserver) the task can have it's state changed from RUNNING/QUEUED to SCHEDULED which can cause a single task instance to be run twice at the same time.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Tested this branch on the Airbnb Airflow staging cluster\r\n- Airbnb has been running very similar logic in our production for many months (not 1-1 since we are still running off of the last release branch)\r\n- In the future we ideally need an integration test to catch double triggers but this is not trivial to do

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- *(replace with a link to AIRFLOW-X)*\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n\r\nloglevel  is required\r\n\r\n[2016-12-01 16:35:07,414: CRITICAL/MainProcess] Unrecoverable error: TypeError('unorderable types: NoneType() <=
