Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13596](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13596) Renames the `DistributedMapCacheServer` and `DistributedSetCacheServer` services along with the associated client services.\r\n\r\n- Renamed DistributedMapCacheServer to MapCacheServer\r\n- Renamed DistributedSetCacheServer to SetCacheServer\r\n- Renamed DistributedMapCacheClientService to MapCacheClientService\r\n- Renamed DistributedSetCacheClientService to SetCacheClientService\r\n\r\nThe naming has been a source of confusion as the implementations are not distributed, but store entries in memory or on the file system of the NiFi node on which the server is running.\r\n\r\nThe renaming removes the word `Distributed` from the implementation services, which is a breaking change for existing flow definitions. Additional renaming includes removing the word `Distributed` from non-user-facing classes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13874](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13874) Refactors `KeyStore` and `SSLContext` creation for unit and integration tests. The changes replace the `TemporaryKeyStoreBuilder` for more granular approaches based on the introduced `EphemeralKeyStoreBuilder` and the existing Certificate Builder from `nifi-security-cert-builder`.\r\n\r\nThese changes obviate the remaining use of `nifi-security-utils`, enabling clearer dependency tracing for modules that need certificate generation for TLS testing. The `nifi-security-ssl` module, containing `EphemeralKeyStoreBuilder`, does not have any additional dependencies, reducing the potential footprint for both runtime and test use cases.\r\n\r\nMoving away from `TemporaryKeyStoreBuilder` avoids creating unnecessary temporary files, allowing many tests to run with memory-based certificates and keys.\r\n\r\nRuntime changes include changing the `StandardSSLContextService` and `LdapProvider` components to use the `Builder` classes from `nifi-security-ssl`, enabling the removal of `SslContextFactory` as part of `nifi-security-utils`.\r\n\r\n#

The command works the same way as deleting a process group via UI. If there are messages in PG queue, deletion will fail. I ported this change from [Anetac's Nifi fork](https://github.com/Eng-Anetac/nifi) where I made it a while ago. We have been using this feature in production at Anetac for months now.\r\n\r\nThe code change to `main` branch is smaller than the one to support/nifi-1.x branch, because @markap14 has already added some of the functionality under NIFI-12898\r\n\r\nRelated PR for support/nifi-1.x branch: https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9387\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

The command works the same way as deleting a process group via UI. If there are messages in PG queue, deletion will fail. I ported this change from [Anetac's Nifi fork](https://github.com/Eng-Anetac/nifi) where I made it a while ago. We have been using this feature in production at Anetac for months now.\r\n\r\nPR with the same feature for `main` branch: https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9388\r\nThe change for support/nifi-1.x branch is larger than for main, because the support branch does not have changes for NIFI-12898\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Original behavior where the provider lists all secrets and matches them to `Secret Name Pattern` is preserved by leaving `Secret Name` parameter undefined. The new behavior will skip listing secrets and ignore `Secret Name Pattern` only if `Secret Name` is provided.  I made this change in [Anetac's Nifi fork](https://github.com/Eng-Anetac/nifi) months ago and we are using it in production.\r\n\r\nRelated PR to main branch:

The solution is to re-instantiate `S3Object` when I/O streams are requested before returning references to the streams. In order to do that, this change also removes the reference to `S3Object` as a class member and adds `bucketName` and `objectKey` class members. \r\n\r\nI made this change in [Anetac's Nifi fork](https://github.com/Eng-Anetac/nifi) months ago and we are using it in production.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13744) Corrects Excel Reader type inferencing with Record Data Type detection based on spreadsheet cell properties.\r\n\r\nThe `CellType` provides the general shape of the value, but requires additional evaluation of `NUMERIC` and `STRING` types to determine whether the field could representation a timestamp, based on Cell Style.\r\n\r\nThe new `CellFieldTypeReader` replaces existing use of the `SchemaInferenceUtil`, which is limited to `String` input values, requiring value formatting. The standard implementation avoids cell value formatting in most cases, instead relying type detection. The POI library can return timestamp values in several forms, including `java.util.Date` and `java.time.LocalDateTime`, but it does not differentiate between values that contain only dates or only times. For these scenarios, using a defined schema for the Excel Reader provides better resolution.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13579](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13579) Improves timestamp formatting and parsing for Record Readers and Record Writers as it relates to zone offset handling.\r\n\r\nFollowing significant changes to move from `java.util.Date` to `java.time` classes for earlier 2.0.0 milestone releases, zone offset handling no longer worked in ways similar to earlier versions. When reading a timestamp string with a zone offset, `LocalDateTime.parse()` would ignore the zone offset and only consider the local date and time components. When writing a timestamp as a string, the converter would throw an exception due to the `LocalDateTime` object not having a value for offset seconds.\r\n\r\nThe current set of changes adjusts Field Converter behavior to address these issues. When converting from a string to a timestamp, the parsing makes use of the [DateTimeFormatter.parseBest()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#parseBest(java.lang.CharSequence,java.time.temporal.TemporalQuery...)) method to first try parsing with `ZonedDateTime` to handle zone offsets, and then parsing with `LocalDateTime`.\r\n\r\nWhen converting from a Timestamp or `LocalDateTime` to a string, the conversion creates a `ZonedDateTime` from a `LocalDateTime` using the system default zone offset, avoiding unexpected zone offset conversion.\r\n\r\nChanges include new unit tests for these scenarios, as well as a new test for the `ValidateRecord` Processor with CSV Reader and Writer, exercising both sides of the conversion. These test methods get the current zone offset value from the JVM to ensure that tests work as expected regardless of the system timezone.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13790](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13790) This PR reports a SEND event for each FlowFile successfully published and transferred to success. I was hesitant to add a `getTransitUri()` method to the KafkaConnectionService API but I certainly can in order to give a more informative URI, and could add other methods if need be to generate an informative description for the provenance event. I could also wrap the new code in a `try-catch` catching and logging an error versus rolling back / failing because the FlowFiles will have already been transferred.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13843](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13843)\r\n\r\nConsider the following use case:\r\n\r\n- GFF Processor, generating a JSON with 3 fields: `a`, `b`, and `c`\r\n- ConvertRecord with JSON Reader / JSON Writer\r\n  - Both reader and writer are configured with a schema only specifying fields `a` and `b`\r\n\r\nThe expected result is a JSON that only contains fields `a` and `b`.\r\n\r\nWe're following the below path in the code:\r\n\r\n- `AbstractRecordProcessor` (L131)\r\n````java\r\nRecord firstRecord = reader.nextRecord(); \r\n````\r\n\r\nIn this case, the default method for `nextRecord()` is defined in `RecordReader` (L50)\r\n\r\n````java\r\ndefault Record nextRecord() throws IOException, MalformedRecordException {\r\n    return nextRecord(true, false);\r\n} \r\n````\r\n\r\nwhere we are NOT dropping the unknown fields (Java doc needs some fixing here as it is saying the opposite)\r\n\r\nWe get to \r\n\r\n````java\r\nwriter.write(firstRecord); \r\n````\r\n\r\nwhich gets us to\r\n\r\n- `WriteJsonResult` (L206)\r\n\r\nHere, we do a check\r\n\r\n````java\r\nisUseSerializeForm(record, writeSchema) \r\n````\r\n\r\nwhich currently returns true when it should not. Because of this we write the serialised form which ignores the writer schema.\r\n\r\nIn this method `isUseSerializeForm()`, we do check\r\n\r\n````java\r\nrecord.getSchema().equals(writeSchema) \r\n````\r\n\r\nBut at this point `record.getSchema()` returns the schema defined in the reader which is equal to the one defined in the writer - even though the record has additional fields compared to the defined schema.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix is to also add a check on\r\n\r\n````java\r\nrecord.isDropUnknownFields() \r\n````\r\n\r\nIf `dropUnknownFields` is `false`, then we do not use the serialised form.\r\n\r\n**While this approach does solve the problem, I suspect that it may have a performance impact given the default on nextRecord() which currently keeps the unknown fields.**\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13813](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13813) Refactors NiFi Runtime property loading and initialization handling to remove the unclear coupling to the bootstrap Class Loader.\r\n\r\nThe `org.apache.nifi.NiFi` main class uses reflection to call `NiFiPropertiesLoader` from the `nifi-properties-loader` library, which is included in Framework NAR. Instead of creating a Class Loader from the bootstrap library directory, the updated approach loads the initial application properties, initializes NAR Class Loaders, and then uses the Framework NAR Class Loader to load application properties using `NiFiPropertiesLoader`.\r\n\r\nThe loading methods in `NiFiPropertiesLoader` include normalization and generating a random sensitive properties key when necessary. These steps are necessary before initializing the NiFi Server, but they are not required for loading NAR Class Loaders.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include refactoring `org.apache.nifi.NiFi` to a minimal `main()` method with logging initialization and uncaught exception handling. Moving startup into a new `org.apache.nifi.runtime.Application` class encapsulates the remaining startup process.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13810](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13810) Updates the `StandardHttpUriBuilder` in `nifi-web-client` to handle the need for a path segment separator when adding both an encoded path and path segments.\r\n\r\nThe `encodedPath()` method serves as base path for the URI and may or may not include a trailing forward slash character. When `encodedPath()` is called together with one or more `addPathSegment()` calls, the builder checks for the presence of a trailing forward slash and adds one if needed between the encoded path and the path segments. This update aligns with behavior previously encapsulated in the OkHttp library.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

It will send the local flow to the coordinator in the connect request, and only when receiving the connected response will it take the flow from the response and sync it into the controller. In addition, if the initial connect request does not succeed, it will not long call initialize on the flow controller, it will just wait until it has been tried again and receives a successful response.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13799) Improves replicated HTTP response handling for requests to cluster nodes, avoiding potential heap exhaustion when downloading large FlowFiles.\r\n\r\nInstead of buffering the entire response body, the updated approach buffers responses with known content length values that are less than 1 MB. For streamed responses with an unknown content length, or large responses, the replication client returns the HTTP response stream. The changes also include a close callback to ensure that the replicated response stream is closed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

missing registry clients are removed at the end instead of the beginning of the synchronization logic. This allows those registry clients to still be referenced while performing synchronization. Also found that if a Processor is missing from cluster's flow but is running in local flow, on startup we get an error indicating that the processor does not belong to the associated process group so fixed that in tandem. Finally, noticed while verifying the fix that we check if the proposed flow is empty with a null check instead of using the isFlowEmpty() method - this could result in inheriting an empty flow from cluster even when a flow is loaded locally.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.
