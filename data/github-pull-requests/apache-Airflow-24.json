We technically do not need it directly as this is a dependency of Flask-WTF, but we need to specify it here to add the limitation The issue to track it is https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-wtf/issues/608 Note. 3.2.0 has been broken because of imports https://github.com/pallets-eco/wtforms/issues/861 which was fixed in 3.2.1, but after import was fixed, the tests started to work with 3.2.1 when the issue 863 is fixed, we should likely leave the line below and specify !=3.2.0,!=3.2.1\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the Edgeworker with metrics output to get live date of the state of the worker on a Dashboard. The PR also enables the EdgeExecutor to check if the Worker is still connected. If not then the state is reseted to UNKNOWN. \r\n\r\n# Details about changes \r\n\r\n* Exports the following metrics:\r\n  * edge_executor.sync.duration: measures the duration of the  sync call of the edge executor\r\n  * edge_worker.heartbeat_count: Heartbeat counter whihc is increased every time the heatbeat was received\r\n  * edge_worker.state: 0 -> shows worker is disconnected, 1 shows worker is connected. tag shows details nameing of the state.\r\n  * edge_worker.jobs_active: shows number of active jobs on this worker\r\n  * edge_worker.concurrency: shows the current concurrency value of the worker\r\n  * edge_worker.num_queues: shows the number of queues and tags contains queue names\r\n* If 5 times the heatbeat was not received the heatbeat the state is set to UNKNOW.\r\n* If worker disconnected the gauge metrics are reseted.\r\n\r\n# Background information about metrics\r\n\r\nAs the tags are ignored in the statsd exporting and open telemetry is not enabled by default I orientated me on the implementation of dag_processing.last_duration like (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/dag_processing/manager.py#L1173) So currently double export.

following a discussion at board@a.o I realized that not all GitHub activity of ours is archived - we use the commits@a.a.o to archive all the commits automatically, and this list is not supposed to be subscribed to in general as it is already far too busy for that, however we can also forward all issues, prs and discussions there, which will make us follow the requirement of the ASF that all the activity in the project should be archived in foundation-managed archives.\r\n\r\nIt also has the nice benefit that there is single place (ponymail commits@a.a.o list) that has great search capabilities and is really nice as a single place where we will be able to find all the activity - regardles if they were in commits, prs, issues or discussions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache

scripts to update pip and uv version were not complete - they did not replace a few of our scripts and documentation. This was especially troublesome for doc replacement, because updating versions manually led to misalignments of tables in markdown.\r\n\r\nLack of completeness of the upgrade caused #43197 and #43135 manual PRs to bump all references.\r\n\r\nAlso an earlier upgrade caused the markdown table to be broken - with UV row table offset by 1.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it:\r\n\r\n* all the scripts and docs are updated now\r\n* when markdown is updated, the table structure is not broken\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

API calls were not made on changing filters, sort and pagination since only changes to search and paused were declared as dependency to the API call. This PR adds all other parameters.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I think changing from last dag run state from running to success and then changing it back to running should trigger another API call to filter by running so that users always see fresh data. There is no refresh button in the UI like legacy UI so either a refresh button should be added or each change should trigger an API call. This seems to be due to staleTime parameter added to the API call options.","created_at":"2024-10-19T07:29:33Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T18:19:43Z","closed_at":"2024-10-22T18:19:43Z","merged_at":"2024-10-22T18:19:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"cccf0d1aa44f666f4be371758d9a9926e6815e7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

the `__init__.py` file from \"providers\" directory, it is not needed there, because \"providers\" is just a folder where we keep provider files, it's not a Python package.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR fixes a few other teething problems with setup of tests that were introcuded in #42505 and #43802 \"masked\" by having `__init__.py` added in providers package:\r\n\r\n* common.sql interface pre-commit used wrong path to generated files\r\n* openlineage extractor test that should not expect \"providers.tests.*\" but \"tests.*\" package\r\n* common_sql_api_stubs wrongly calculating generated path for stub-generated files\r\n* pytest_plugin expecting .asf.yml in \"airflow\" sources - even during compatibility tests with older version of airflow (where the .asf.yml is not present)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n

some of our tests, handlers for loggers were set to the \"logging.Handler()\" and that created a side effect where when they were not cleaned by another test, they produced `NotImplementedError: emit must be implemented by Handler subclasses` message - because indeed `logging.Handler()` emit message raised NotImplementedError.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that those tests (and some others) cleaned-up the handlers only BEFORE the tests but not AFTER - so if it happened that the same \"test worker\" run another test afterwards, that cleaned the handlers but did not set the handlers back, the side effect was gone. But when xdist arranged the tests to different pytest workers, the Handlers could remain registered in loggers so other tests could attempt to emit some logs in case they logged something to a parent logger.\r\n\r\nThe fix applied is to create a fixture that cleans all loggers BEFORE and AFTER a test - and add the fixture to tests that modify handlers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

airflow and providers `__init__.py` files in order to get providers import work again.\r\n\r\nThis is done by excluding the two `__init__.py` files from automated ruff isort rules adding `from __future__ import annotations`.\r\n\r\nAlso removed the `__init__.py` file from \"providers\" directory, it is not needed there, because \"providers\" is just a folder where we keep provider files, it's not a Python package.\r\n\r\nThat should finally get rid of the Intellij teething import problem that has been introduced in #42505.\r\n\r\nThere were earlier - unsuccesful - attempts to fix it in the #43116 and #43081 that followed #42951 - but the key is that Pycharm requires the namespace's extend_path to be first \"real\" line of code in the `__init__.py` to understand that the package is an \"explicit\" namespace package - and it conflicts with the requirement of \"from __future__ import annotations\" to be the first line of Python code.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR fixes a few other teething problems with setup of tests that were introcuded in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42505 and #43802 \"masked\" by having `__init__.py` added in providers package:\r\n\r\n* common.sql interface pre-commit used wrong path to generated files\r\n* openlineage extractor test that should not expect \"providers.tests.*\"\r\n  but \"tests.*\" package\r\n* common_sql_api_stubs wrongly calculating generated path for\r\n  stub-generated files\r\n* pytest_plugin expecting .asf.yml in \"airflow\" sources - even during\r\n  compatibility tests with older version of airflow (where the\r\n  .asf.yml is not present)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#38365, it was mentioned the label really should use logical date, not data interval end. This comment was however not addressed at all before the PR was merged.\r\n\r\nWhile using `dataIntervalEnd` fixes _some_ of the runs, it actually makes the display wrong for others. The run ID is generated from logical date, which _may_ be data interval start or end, or another value altogether depending on how the DAG is configured (specifically which timetable is used) and how the run is triggered. Using either `dataIntervalStart` or `dataIntervalEnd` is wrong.","created_at":"2024-10-18T08:06:18Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T21:29:25Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T13:20:11Z","merged_at":"2024-10-18T13:20:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb49aa323bd5bad4cdd9e3027d6ae918fff9f768","assignee":{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"htt

far `pip` and `uv` version change caused clean reinstallation of the CI image `pip` dependencies - including the cached layer from main - which pre-installed airlfow to speed up reinstallation of \"final\" airflow package.\r\n\r\nHowever since we started to update `uv` more frequently - those frequent rebuilds are ... to costly (about 3 minutes extra when uv version changed.\r\n\r\nThis change implements optimization of this workflow - the main cache installation is done using LATEST uv or pip and only after that UV and PIP get reinstalled to the fixed version specified in Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nRelated: #42999\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
