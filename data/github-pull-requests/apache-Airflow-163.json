and ready for review.\r\n\r\nTLDR: add support for k8s hook in KPO; use it always (even when no conn id); continue to consider the core k8s settings that KPO already takes into account but emit deprecation warning about them.\r\n\r\nThis one was pretty tricky.\r\n\r\nHere are some notes:\r\n\r\nKPO takes into account a few settings from core airflow cfg (e.g. verify ssl, tcp keepalive, context, config file, and in_cluster).  So if we're using the hook to generate the client, somehow the hook has to take these settings into account. But we don't want the hook to consider these settings in general.  \r\n\r\nSo we need to read the settings in KPO and somehow pass them to the hook.  We can't do it through init params, because that would interfere with migration to an airflow connection.  So what I did was establish some \"private\" attribtues that could be patched from KPO when the setting is something other than the default.  Then the hook will consider these patched params only when it's not using an airflow connection or hook params.\r\n\r\nThe other tricky part was we want to minimize the warnings.  So we need to try and warn only when the configuration taken from core settings actually ends up being used.  E.g. `[kubernetes] > in_cluster=True` is the default value so we only want to warn when it's been set to False, and only when it is actually considered (so that when the user adds an airflow connection, the warning will go away).\r\n\r\nLastly one thing to note (smaller thing), with two settings, when adding them to the hook, I changed the wording.  Core airflow setting `verify_ssl` is True by default.  When adding this to the hook, I add it as `disable_verify_ssl`.  And the reason for this is, `False` seems like a safer default value.  So the default would be `disable_verify_ssl=False`.  E.g. if you did `if extra.get('disable_verify_ssl'): disable` that is safe when the key is not there.  But if you do `if not extra.get('verify_ssl'): disable` well this will disable SSL when the value is not there.  To make this work you'd have to do `if extra.get('verify_ssl') is False`.  The other thing\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-30T04:51:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T18:37:44Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T18:37:43Z","merged_at":"2022-05-31T18:37:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"60eb9e106f5915398eafd6aa339ec710c102dc09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

The code/steps follow a structure similar to that of [Google Sheets integration](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/suite/hooks/sheets.py).\r\n\r\nFurther steps to close #8471 involve creating operators to write to GCS, corresponding unit tests and system tests.

#19409\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior within the `WasbHook` is to always attempt to create a container when uploading files to Azure Blob Storage. This allows users to not necessarily have to use an existing container to upload files but one can be created as part of the upload process. ~Unfortunately, if users authenticate via a Signed Access Signature (SAS) only certain signatures allow for container creation.~ Unfortunately not every configured connection will have permissions to create containers. In these scenarios, uploads to Azure Blob Storage can fail.\r\n\r\n~This PR adds a check if a configured SAS permits container creation. If this operation is not permitted, then the container creation is not attempted. The default container-creation behavior is still intact.~\r\nThis PR adds the target container creation to be configurable if needed. (I also converted the unit tests I touched to `pytest` as well as a \"bonus\").\r\n\r\n>Note: The PR does set the default behavior now to _not_ attempt container creation. I do not think a majority of users take advantage of this functionality now but it is configurable to turn it on if needed. If anyone feels that the default should be to attempt container creation for any backwards compat fears, I'm happy to update the default. Kind of a gray area here I suppose whether this should have been the approach in the first place + impact to users.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

If a region is not specified, the Snowflake instance will take US-West-2 as the default instance, however, the URI is malformed and results in an erroneous connection. This fix forms the URI depending on whether the user specifies the region name or not.\r\n\r\nFor example, when a region is specified, the URI looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'snowflake://{user}:{password}@{account}.{region}/{database}/{schema}'\r\n'?warehouse={warehouse}&role={role}&authenticator={authenticator}'\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf a region is not

`num` parameter, the following code is executed:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f62e690efeb80863855282d33d3e047d01af2db0/airflow/models/dag.py#L564-L573\r\n\r\nUtil function `utils_date_range` (which is actually named `date_range`, but is renamed during import) takes these arguments:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f62e690efeb80863855282d33d3e047d01af2db0/airflow/utils/dates.py#L38-L43\r\n\r\n`delta` argument is theoretically optional, but the first two lines make the function useless without this argument.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f62e690efeb80863855282d33d3e047d01af2db0/airflow/utils/dates.py#L82-L83\r\n\r\nTherefore, the current implementation of `date_range` in DAG class always returns an empty list when using `num` argument. This fix provides `delta` of  `self.normalized_schedule_interval` to make it properly work, which is a way that this function worked before changes (so more or less I'm only reverting a change made in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/5034414208f85a8be61fe51d6a3091936fe402ba)). I also added a unit test that makes sure this doesn't happen again in the future.\r\n\r\nI know this function is deprecated, but it's still a small bug that IMO should be fixed.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-26T20:43:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-20T06:51:16Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T00:35:14Z","merged_at":"2022-02-28T00:35:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"768d851ca995bbe46cfdaeed7c46a51201b723e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19891\r\n\r\nFixes number of issues reported by MyPy:\r\n- Provide explicit type for `dates` variable\r\n- `states_by_task_id` is not Optional as functions upstream and downstream are not that passes the same variable\r\n- `render_dag_dependencies` function's only parameter is not optional as it does not handle that case nor anywhere in the codebase it is accessed as empty\r\n- `self.filename_template` and `self.filename_jinja_template` are Optional and hence need to be handled accordingly inside `_render_filename` function\r\n- Handling case when regex does not match anything\r\n- Providing possible types for \"template_env\" variable explicitly\r\n- Removed Overloading for the functions. I don't see any reason why they are necessary. @ashb Please comment otherwise as they were added in #20000\r\n- Better handling for dynamic field access for `localize` and `convert` methods\r\n- `relativedelta` does not define type for `seconds` and accepts float (I tested empirically) as well which MyPy complains that is not allowed. So, ignoring\r\n- MyPy dont understand that `v` in `pendulum.instance(v ` can not be None as previous check and hence failing\r\n- Added one more test case for correct_maybe_zipped to check for an empty input\r\n\r\nThis is Part 1 for (airflow/utils) and will do Part 2 in a separate PR to keep scope small for review and focus.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the

recently upgraded from Airflow 1.9 to 2.2.2 (to be more precise, we are still in the process of upgrading, dealing with various issues related to the upgrade).  I like the change that the newly refactored SSHHook initializes most of the parameters in `__init__`, making customization easier.  However, there is one \"heavy\" operation related to SSH proxy which I wonder might be better off moving back to where it will be used.\r\n\r\nI noticed that for every 30+ seconds (`min_file_process_interval=30`), during the run of DAGFileProcessor, a bunch of SSH processes would be launched.  This is because a `paramiko.ProxyCommand` is ran for any connection used in tasks, as long as that connection has a \"ProxyCommand\" in the `.ssh/config` file.  This seems too much (also heavy) to me.\r\n\r\nI wonder if a change in the spirit of the attached pull request is acceptable or not?","created_at":"2021-12-22T21:57:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T17:09:14Z","closed_at":"2022-01-09T21:37:52Z","merged_at":"2022-01-09T21:37:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"129b4d2ac2ce09d42fb487f8a9aaac7eb7901a05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

the return value from `SSHOperator.execute()` depends on whether `enable_xcom_pickling` is True or False.\r\n* If `enable_xcom_pickling=True`, a `bytes` object is returned.\r\n* otherwise, an `str` object with uuencode is returned.\r\n\r\nLater the return value may be stored in XCom and retrieved by other tasks.\r\n\r\nThis confuses the \"consumer\" of its XCom messages.  They have to also check `enable_xcom_pickling` to know if the result should first be uudecoded.  Even worse, they have to know it is generated by an \"SSHOperator\" because other operators do not do that.\r\n\r\nShould we change the behavior to always returning a `str`, without uuencode, as the attached pull request suggests?  Is that a sensible thing to do?\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2021-12-22T21:29:54Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T00:33:24Z","closed_at":"2021-12-29T00:20:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efef7993529b595d923d98218a31b4e7d7877d11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/20473/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/20473/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/20473/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a71cbf52fc4833e0a4125db6335bf8b597c74fa1","head":{"label":"derkuci:ssh-return-str-for-xcom","ref":"ssh-return-str-for-xcom","sha":"a71cbf52fc4833e0a4125db6335bf8b597c74fa1","user":{"login":"derkuci","id":525207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/525207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci","html_url":"https://github.com/derkuci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440985537,"node_id":"R_kgDOGkjnwQ","name":"airflow","full_name":"derkuci/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"derkuci","id":525207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/525207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","ur

If we want to combine the kubernetesexecutor (airflow helm chart) and istio as a means of DNS, we run into issues where each task does not terminate but rather stays in a \"Completed\" state while the istio-proxy continues listening. This creates a bottleneck for the dags to run.\r\n\r\nThere is a k8s annotation that we can apply where the sidecar injection does not happen: `sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"false\"`\r\nOriginally, I tried applying this annotation to airflowPodAnnotations in the values.yaml, but this also disabled the injection for the webserver, which was the only service I needed to inject for my use case. I experimented with setting airflowPodAnnotations to disable injection and specifically webserver annotations to `sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"true\"` but that left the webserver with two annotations - one true and one false.\r\n\r\nInstead, this change addresses client facing ui's that would benefit from istio injection, and disabling the istio sidecar injection on all other services.\r\n\r\nAssuming this change is deemed appropriate, further applications of this could be adding functionality to configuring istio gateways/virtualservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the
