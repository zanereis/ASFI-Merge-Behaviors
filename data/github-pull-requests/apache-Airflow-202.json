a dag file is executed via Dag File Processors and multiple callbacks are\r\ncreated either via zombies or executor events, the dag file is added to\r\nthe _file_path_queue and the manager will launch a new process to\r\nprocess it, which it should not since the dag file is currently under\r\nprocessing. This will bypass the _parallelism eventually especially when\r\nit takes a long time to process some dag files and since `self._processors`\r\nis just a dict with file path as the key. So multiple processors with the same key\r\ncount as one and hence parallelism is bypassed.\r\n\r\nThis address the same issue as https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11875\r\nbut instead does not exclude file paths that are recently processed and that\r\nrun at the limit (which is only used in tests) when Callbacks are sent by the\r\nAgent. This is by design as the execution of Callbacks is critical. This is done\r\nwith a caveat to avoid duplicate processor -- i.e. if a processor exists,\r\n the file path is removed from the queue. This means that the processor with\r\nthe file path to run callback will be still run when the filepath is added again in the \r\nnext loop\r\n\r\nTests are added to check the same.\r\n\r\ncloses https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13047, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11875/\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

a docker-compose file that contains a simple sample configuration that allows you to quickly run Airflow in a Docker environment. This is a part of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8605#issuecomment-759469443, but much simpler because .... novice users don't care at all about their environment, but need to get all components up and running quickly. In the next steps, we can work on adding wizards that will allow you to generate your own docker-compose file, but I think it will require some dependent documentation and this is not needed in this section of the documentation yet.\r\n\r\nPart of: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8605\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/13163 - I attempted to only run\r\nCallback requests when they are defined on DAG. But I just found out\r\nthat while we were storing the task-level callbacks as string in Serialized\r\nJSON, we were not storing DAG level callbacks and hence it default to None\r\nwhen the Serialized DAG was deserialized which meant that the DAG callbacks\r\nwere not run.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it, we don't need to store DAG level callbacks as string, as\r\nwe don't display them in the Webserver and the actual contents are not used anywhere\r\nin the Scheduler itself. Scheduler just checks if the callbacks are defined and sends\r\nit to DagFileProcessorProcess to run with the actual DAG file. So instead of storing\r\nthe actual callback as string which would have resulted in larger JSON blob, I have\r\nadded properties to determine whether a callback is defined or not.\r\n\r\n(`dag.has_on_success_callback` and `dag.has_on_failure_callback`)\r\n\r\nNote: SLA callbacks don't have issue, as we currently check that SLAs are defined on\r\nany tasks are not, if yes, we send it to DagFileProcessorProcess which then executes\r\nthe SLA callback defined on DAG.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

adding a test for this is bit hard, but I am opened to suggestion.\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\n\r\nWhen using the KubernetesPodOperator with\r\nlog_events_on_failure=True, and the pod exits,\r\nthe executor needs to access the events in the namespace.\r\n\r\nBefore this resulted in an exception when using the chart\r\nas this it was not permitted by the pod-launcher

custom providers with custom connections can define\r\nextra widgets and fields, however there were problems with\r\nthose custom fields in Aiflow 2.0.0:\r\n\r\n* When connection type was a subset of another connection\r\n  type (for example jdbc and jdbcx) widgets from the\r\n  'subset' connection type appeared also in the 'superset'\r\n  one due to prefix matching in javascript.\r\n\r\n* Each connection when saved received 'full set' of extra\r\n  fields from other connection types (with empty values).\r\n  This problem is likely present in Airflow 1.10 but due\r\n  to limited number of connections supported it had no\r\n  real implications besides slightly bigger dictionary\r\n  stored in 'extra' field.\r\n\r\n* The extra field values were not saved for custom connections.\r\n  Only the predefined connection types could save extras in\r\n  extras field.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by:\r\n\r\n* adding __ matching for javascript to match only full connection\r\n  types not prefixes\r\n* saving only the fields matching extra__<conn_type> when the\r\n  connection is saved\r\n* removing filtering on 'known' connection types (the above\r\n  filtering on `extra__` results in empty extra for\r\n  connections that do not have any extra field defined.\r\n\r\nFixes #13597\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the newly improved REST API from an independent web application is currently prohibited by browsers due to the lack of [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

via `AIRFLOW__API__ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_HEADERS`\r\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` via `AIRFLOW__API__ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS`\r\n- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` via `AIRFLOW__API__ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN`\r\n\r\nThis only covers a minimum of all potential headers that could be utilized, but the added `set_cors_headers_on_response` function establishes an obvious place for it to be further extended in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nWe did look into utilizing [Flask-CORS](https://github.com/corydolphin/flask-cors) to add this functionality, but ultimately found it to be overkill given we only want to add this to the API endpoint and not the entire Webserver application.\r\n\r\nI've added documentation of this feature to Security/API and also cross-linked to that documentation from within the API documentation as

backends fetch credentials from environment variables, but other\r\ncredentials are typically stored in connections. This patch deprecates\r\nemail credentials from environment variables and checks connections\r\nfirst. We can drop the environment variable fallback in a future\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nBased on conversation in #13463. I would like to standardize credential handling in email backends, then add an SES backend separately. I'm marking this as a draft for feedback, and I'll write tests once we agree on an approach. cc @mik-laj

change slightly optimizes waiting for prod images. Waiting\r\nfor images necessarily takes one slot from jobs queue, even if\r\nthose jobs do nothing at all. This is unfortunate, but seems\r\nthere is no easy way to do it differently because GitHub\r\nActions does not support yet cross-workflow dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes waiting for images in the way that PROD images\r\nand CI images waiting happen sequentially rather than in parallell.\r\n\r\nPROD images are, as of #13557 prepared sequentially which\r\nmeans that there is no point to wait for PROD images in parallel\r\nto CI images.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

approach gives us the ability to keep track of the actions we use, doesn't fall foul of the \"no third party actions\" org-wide setting, and still gives us \"audit-by-default\" -- any change to the commit of a submodule would need a PR and GitHub handles this quite nicely on the PR review.\r\n\r\nNote: I an still generally against submodules as they are difficult to use, but since this is only for CI and everyone* else can checkout the repo and not have to care that the submodules exist I think it the right tool for this use case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
