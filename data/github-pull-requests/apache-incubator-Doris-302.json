Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen build a doris release, the release manager need do a lot of works and sometimes he or she may forget something. And sometimes the release maybe not fully tested because the release is build manually by the release manager and the env maybe wrong. In this PR do follow things:\r\n\r\n1. add licenses and notices file to our binary folder as default so that the release manager do not need copy them manually.\r\n2. strip debug info from meta tool by default since debug info is useless for meta tool.\r\n\r\nAfter this we could get the binary from github pipeline in the future and the binary is fully tested and it is more stable.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n7.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe former logic in replace function didn't check whether the input old str is empty or not. The `string.find` function of cpp stl would return pos 0, which would result in an endless string replace logic loop, and end up with OOM.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed lots of issues when building from source on macOS with Apple M1 chip.\r\n\r\nValidation Environment:\r\n**OS:**\r\nmacOS Monterey\r\n\r\n**Compiler:**\r\nApple clang version 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.102)\r\nTarget: arm64-apple-darwin21.6.0\r\nThread model: posix\r\nInstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin\r\n\r\n## ATTENTION\r\n\r\nThe job for supporting macOS with Apple M1 chip is too big and there are lots of unresolved issues during runtime:\r\n1. Some errors with memory tracker occur when BE (RELEASE) starts.\r\n2. Some UT cases fail.\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis PR kicks off the job. Guys who are interested in this job can continue to fix these runtime issues.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n./build.sh -j 8 --be --clean\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Something else\r\n\r\nIt takes around _**10+**_ minutes to build BE (with prebuilt third-parties) on macOS with M1 chip. We will improve the  development experience on macOS greatly when we finish the adaptation job.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe former code in cases like `test_stream_load` didn't consider the data sync, which might cause the qt_sql right after the stream load turning out to fail.\r\nBy simply add the `sql \"sync\"` before the qt_sql, the problems might be resolved.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis pr is mainly to optimize statistical tasks. Includes the following:\r\n1. No longer generate statistics tasks for empty tables, and move the logic of skipping empty partitions to the process of task generation.\r\n2. Adjusted the default configuration related to statistics to improve the efficiency of statistics collection, parameters include `cbo_concurrency_statistics_task_num`,`statistic_job_scheduler_execution_interval_ms`  and `statistic_task_scheduler_execution_interval_ms`.\r\n3. Optimize the display of statistical tasks.\r\n4. In addition, some `org.apache.parquet.Strings` packages are changed to `com.google.common.base.Strings` to avoid the exception that Strings cannot be found in local debug.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Init of bloom filter takes some time in allocate and memset. If we run p1 tests with -parallel=20 -suiteParallel=20 -actionParallel=20, then we get error message like 'send fragment timeout 5s'.\r\n\r\nThe patch fixes the problem in the following 2 ways:\r\n1. Replace one mutex block with 128s.\r\n2. If a plan fragment does not have a runtime filter, it does not need to take the locks.\r\n\r\n# Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.
