we have no updated sphinx-autoapi to a more recent version it supports showing type hints in the documentation, so we don't need to have the type hints _and_ the `:type` lines -- which is good, as the ones in the doc strings are easy to get out of date!\r\n\r\nThe following settings have been set:\r\n\r\n- `autodoc_typehints = 'description'` -- show types in description (where previous `:type` used to show up)\r\n\r\n- `autodoc_typehints_description_target = 'documented'` -- only link to types that are documented. (Without this we have some missing return types that aren't documented, and aren't linked to in our current python API docs, so this caused a build failure)\r\n\r\n- `autodoc_typehints_format = 'short'` -- Shorten type hints where possible, i.e. `StringIO` instead of `io.StringIO`\r\n\r\nBefore (https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/_api/airflow/models/baseoperator/index.html#airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/150141676-6c6c5ab0-d595-4018-87a5-61794bd2dcab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/150141626-ea21a80d-b89d-42b0-bc24-f687f704d193.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

upstream dependencies when an XComArg is used in a MappedOperator, and (de)serialize them correctly.\r\n\r\nWe can only re-create XComArg at the DAG level as we need to get hold of the Operator (not just a task_id) so we need a two phase approach here: when deserializing operators we create them as a place-holder class (`_XcomRef`) and then \"up a level\" when deserializing the DAG we turn these back in to XComArg objects.\r\n\r\n(And in so doing we needed to fix a bug or two in serializing MappedOperator that have a DAG -- it caused a recursion error.)\r\n\r\nThis PR could possibly be split in to two (one to set deps, a second to serialize them.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new Airflow operators that make use of the new [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker)'s [Start/Stop API](https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration/api-reference/v4.0/derived-table#start_a_pdt_materialization) for  Persistent Derived Tables ([PDTs](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/derived-tables)). These operators allow to manage PDT materialization via [Looker API](https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration/api-reference/v4.0).\r\n\r\nCurrently supported operations are:\r\n- Start PDT build\r\n- Check PDT build status\r\n- Stop PDT build\r\n\r\nUnder the hood these new operators use [Looker SDK](https://pypi.org/project/looker-sdk/) - a python client for Looker API.\r\n\r\n_Note_: Looker PDT operators are being released as a part of [Google Cloud operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/1.0.0/operators/cloud/index.html). While Looker is a part of GCP now, it's still in the process of migrating to the GCP infrastructure. That's why for now we can't use [Google Cloud connection](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/connections/gcp.html), and a custom _Looker-specific_ Airflow connection needs to be created.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new Looker operator, sensor, hook, example DAGs, tests, docs, and logo. \r\nIt also updates provider and setup files.\r\n\r\nNew classes:\r\n- `LookerStartPdtBuildOperator`\r\n  - submits a job to start a PDT build in a synchronous/asynchronous way\r\n  - checks the state of the PDT build submitted in a _synchronous_ way\r\n- `LookerCheckPdtBuildSensor`\r\n  - checks the state of the PDT build submitted in a _asynchronous_ way\r\n- `LookerHook`\r\n  - configures a connection to Looker SDK using Airflow connection settings\r\n  - handles communication b/w the operator/sensor and Looker SDK\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n- `TestLookerStartPdtBuildOperator`\r\n  - tests synchronous/asynchronous execution of `LookerStartPdtBuildOperator`\r\n  - tests `cancel_on_kill` flag that specifies whether to cancel the PDT build or not, when a task is manually killed\r\n- `TestLookerCheckPdtBuildSensor`\r\n  - tests possible build states: `done`, `error`, `wait`, `cancelled`\r\n- `TestLookerHook`\r\n  - tests `wait_for_job` used by `LookerStartPdtBuildOperator` in _synchronous_ mode\r\n  - tests `check_pdt_build` used to get a build status from Looker SDK\r\n  - tests `start_pdt_build` used to start a build via Looker SDK\r\n  - tests `stop_pdt_build` used to stop a build via Looker SDK\r\n\r\n_Note_: There are no system tests since Looker doesn't have an automated process to create a test environment.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe main documentation is in `looker.rst` file as well as in docstrings.\r\n\r\n`looker.rst` contains:\r\n- High level information about Looker and Looker API\r\n- Prerequisite tasks with examples\r\n- How to start a PDT materialization job\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nExample of using Looker PDT operator in _synchronous_ mode (start and status are combined in one task) \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11273622/151217636-dbb46ad8-877f-4838-9f0a-aa6e716a56ec.png)\r\n\r\nExample of using Looker PDT operator in _asynchronous_ mode (start and status

more and more things being put into the `@task` decorator, it becomes more difficult to see what names are being used, since the mixin-inheritance structure requires looking at the mixin declarations to know what names each mixin provides. This troubles me while reviewing #20860.\r\n\r\nBy using a composition-based approach, these names become immediately visible in the same file, making it easier to design and review new name additions.\r\n\r\nI also added some more type annotations to make the return type easier to check.

folks, this issue was brought up in [this Slack thread](https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CCRR5EBA7/p1641501716009300), where base_aws.py spams scheduler logs with logging regarding how the boto session is being constructed. \r\n\r\n  base_aws.py was annotated with logging starting in ~2.0, but this\r\n  logging was added at info level. Meaning every time a boto session\r\n  is created many log lines are added regarding how the session was\r\n  constructed. Most of this logging is better suited at the debug\r\n  level to avoid spamming the Airflow logs every time a boto session\r\n  is created, which can be very frequent.\r\n\r\nI've gone through and moved some of the heavy hitters to debug level (including messages that are logged unconditionally), but I tried to leave some of the less common logging to be at info level since I suspected push back. Let me know what folks think!\r\n\r\nHere is an example snippet from cloudwatch showing the kind of log spam we're talking about:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-01-11 11-18-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65743084/149399425-aca4c653-9c08-4802-a4f6-385cf85707cd.png)\r\n \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR aims to remove an unnecessary logic in `AwsAthenaOperator` (and in certain use cases, it may cause confusion)\r\n\r\n## What this PR does\r\nFor `AwsAthenaOperator`, if `client_request_token` is not provided, we should do nothing here, rather than generating a UUID explicitly for it.\r\n\r\n## Why do we need this change\r\n- According to AWS doc (link provided below), boto3 will autopopulate `ClientRequestToken` if it's not provided. So it's not necessary to generate it explicitly here\r\n- The current logic means a UUID will be generated when the DAG is being parsed into a DAG object. When we check this DAG object, we will see a \"random\" `client_request_token`. This may not be desired (for example in the product my team is running, this is causing issue).\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\nRelevant AWS Doc link:

appears that CLI docs are mostly automated and the command is pretty intuitive.\r\n\r\nOne thing that's maybe a bit non-obvious (though very sensible) that I'll highlight here is that for DagRuns the last scheduled dag run is always retained.  This is to ensure continuity with with scheduled dag runs.  \r\n\r\nThe other thing that's maybe nonobvious is that we have foreign key relationships and they have `on delete cascade` built in to the model so this means if your cleanup run deletes a dag run it will also delete all of its associated TIs, even if you didn't ask to cleanup the TI table.\r\n\r\nI have toyed with the idea of moving this to the airflow db subcommand for now since it's very much db-specific and we don't have any other maintenance commands at the moment. I we add a lot of maintenancey stuff later we can always move the commands. I welcome opinions on this.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I should point out is, the verbose mode doesn't do anything right now.  Initially I thought we might print out the rows that were deleted (similar to how they are printed to logs in the \"maintenance dags\" that inspired this effort).  But I don't think it's actually that helpful to do and it could be a lot of data which could actually be harmful since it would crowd out other output.  So I've left the verbose option but it doesn't do anything.  We could leave it, remove it, or add some kind of verbose output.    Similarly, I thought we might want to print all the to-be-deleted rows in the dry run, but for the same reason I decided not to do that.  Though I've left some print rows logic in there in case we want to enable that.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-12T23:11:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T18:13:18Z","closed_at":"2022-02-26T05:55:22Z","merged_at":"2022-02-26T05:55:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"c75774d3a31efe749f55ba16e782737df9f53af4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

investigating another issue, I found what appears to be a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20178 in the `_executable_task_instances_to_queued` function of the scheduler job. \r\n\r\nHere is the affected piece of code:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c9023fad4287213e4d3d77f4c66799c762bff7ba/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L335-L351\r\n\r\nSo we're iterating through a list of `(pool_name: string, task_instances: List[TaskInstance])` pairs, but then checking the value of `task_instance.pool_slots`, which is not explicitly set anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis means that we actually end up using the value set implicitly by this loop earlier in the function:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c9023fad4287213e4d3d77f4c66799c762bff7ba/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L318-L319\r\n\r\nThis also means that we're comparing the pool capacity to the required slots from a task which may not even be assigned to that pool, which could have other affects. \r\n\r\nAnd because of the `continue`, if this task happens to require more slots than the specified pool can provide, then all of the scheduled tasks in all pools will be skipped over and none will be advanced to the `QUEUED` state. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I've refactored this check such that it checks every TI in `task_instances` individually and simply removes any non-executable TIs from the list of candidates tasks to be queued. I've updated the test accordingly.

users installing Airflow for the first time may be unaware that Airflow currently supports only recent versions of Python 3. Also, successful installation requires Python 3. The mention of pip has been a clue to those who know it comes with Python 3, but others have been in the dark. Users unaware of what version of Python is in their path might be prompted to check -- and they may even be surprised to learn that their recent installation of Python defaulted to Python 2.\r\n\r\nThe Start guide for local installation does not currently mention this requirement, and users prompted to check their version of Python or upgrade to Python 3 will have a much better experience attempting to install Airflow locally.\r\n\r\nThis small change to the Start>Local doc adds the Python 3 requirement information in the note.","created_at":"2022-01-09T22:40:57Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T14:21:20Z","closed_at":"2022-01-10T19:55:34Z","merged_at":"2022-01-10T19:55:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb5bd64948596f284dd70929010724946cbfa414","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes
