was a  teething problem after #45259 - when running tests for all providers rather than selectively the \"new structure\" providers (currently airbyte) tests were not running when \"all\" provider tests were run. There were two problems:\r\n\r\n* typo in \"tests\" (was \"test\") folder name for providers\r\n* full local paths were passed from Host (rather than relative paths from airlfow root) for found providers\r\n\r\nAlso the \"new\" providers are moved to be first in the list of pytest folders to see that it is actually working.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

are a few improvements just merged in the latest version of the \"stash\" suite of actions that we contributed.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes were result of making the #45289 works with stash action and since the changes were added we found that we need to do things differently (for example rather than storing .cache directly we need to tar the directories because we need to preserve permissions and symbolic links). There is however one useful feature that remained - namely protecting against accidentally downloading stash from the main branch, when the PR needs only \"its own\" artifact (helpful in case of typos in the workflow where wrong image artifact name is specified).\r\n\r\nThis PR switches to latest version of the action and enables the protection in \"prepare images\" composite actions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

optional, alternative way of triggering a job - both options will work:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# regular job run by id\r\ntrigger_job_run1 = DbtCloudRunJobOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"trigger_job_run1\",\r\n    job_id=48617,\r\n    check_interval=10,\r\n    timeout=300,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# equivalent job run by name\r\ntrigger_job_run3 = DbtCloudRunJobOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"trigger_job_run3\",\r\n    project_name=\"my_dbt_project\",\r\n    environment_name=\"prod\",\r\n    job_name=\"my_dbt_job\",\r\n    check_interval=10,\r\n    timeout=300,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is beneficial in dynamically configured environments (e.g. managed by Infrastructure as Code) when ``job_id`` is not known upfront (or may change over time) and therefore hardcoding it is not convenient.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

PR restructures the Mapped Operator and Mapped Task Group code to live in\r\nthe Task SDK at definition time.\r\n\r\nThe big thing this change _does not do_ is make it possible to execute mapped\r\ntasks via the Task Execution API server etc -- that is up next (https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44360).\r\n\r\nThere were some un-avoidable changes to the scheduler/expansion part of mapped\r\ntasks here. Of note:\r\n\r\n`BaseOperator.get_mapped_ti_count` has moved from an instance method on\r\nBaseOperator to be a class method. The reason for this was that with the move\r\nof more and more of the \"definition time\" code into the TaskSDK BaseOperator\r\nand AbstractOperator it is no longer possible to add DB-accessing code to a\r\nbase class and have it apply to the subclasses. (i.e.\r\n`airflow.models.abstractoperator.AbstractOperator` is now _not always_ in the\r\nMRO for tasks. Eventually that class will be deleted, but not yet)\r\n\r\nOn a similar vein XComArg's `get_task_map_length` is also moved to a single\r\ndispatch class method on the TaskMap model since now the definition time\r\nobjects live in the TaskSDK, and there is no realistic way to get a per-type\r\nsubclass with DB logic (i.e. it's very complex to end up with a\r\nPlainDBXComArg, a MapDBXComArg, etc. that we can attach the method too)\r\n\r\nFor those who aren't aware, singledispatch (and singledispatchmethod) are a\r\npart of the standard library when the type of the first argument is used to\r\ndetermine which implementation to call. If you are familiar with C++ or Java\r\nthis is very similar to method overloading, the one caveat is that it _only_\r\nexamines the type of the first argument, not the full signature.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal here is to have a clean separation between \"runtime/definition time\" behaviour (i.e. creating mapped tasks, or running a mapped task) and expanding a mapped task (which is a scheduling-time operation only)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

small Flask application is embedded in fastapi application using `WSGIMiddleware`. This flask application can throw some exceptions. These exceptions are then propagated to the fastapi application. Since these exceptions are specific to Flask and not handled on the fastapi side, it results as a 500.\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n- On Flask side, it convert these exceptions to JSON so that fastapi can parse them and understand them\r\n- On fastapi side, through a middleware, if I receive an exception as JSON, I convert it to a fastapi exception\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

using a deferrable BatchOperator, it is possible to specify the `max_retries` and `poll_interval`, but this does not appear to terminate the job once the task times out.\r\n\r\nHaving the ability to specify the timeout and letting the job be terminated will allow us to enforce strict timeouts on critical pipelines running on Fargate via AWS Batch.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to allow specifying `timeout` in the BatchOperator constructor:\\\r\nhttps://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/batch/client/submit_job.html\r\n\r\n> timeout (dict) –\r\n>\r\n> The timeout configuration for this SubmitJob operation. You can specify a timeout duration after which Batch terminates your jobs if they haven’t finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn’t retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. This configuration overrides any timeout configuration specified in the job definition. For array jobs, child jobs have the same timeout configuration as the parent job. For more information, see [Job Timeouts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/job_timeouts.html) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.\r\n>\r\n> - attemptDurationSeconds (integer) –\r\n>\r\n>    The job timeout time (in seconds) that’s measured from the job attempt’s startedAt timestamp. After this time passes, Batch terminates your jobs if they aren’t finished. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.\r\n>\r\n>    For array jobs, the timeout applies to the child jobs, not to the parent array job.\r\n>\r\n>    For multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs, the timeout applies to the whole job, not to the individual nodes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45512\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the case when schema `autodetect` is used in `BigQueryCreateExternalTableOperator`. Currently, the table created in BigQuery can't be queried when empty `schema.fields` are passed to GCP. Simply omitting empty `schema.fields` to be passed in request body to GCP allows schema auto-detection flow to prosper.\r\n\r\nThis part of API is marked as deprecated, hence [unit tests](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/ffe09d62ed15bbc09aeba19ebd5d1b2a2cc8e0ed) I was able to come up with fail:\r\n```\r\nE   airflow.exceptions.AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning: Passing table parameters via keywords arguments will be deprecated.

is a follow-up after #45564 - it fixes the `--from-pr` and `--from-run` to work (it was failing with file does not exist).\r\n\r\nAlso found out that gettempdir might return different directory depending on which is your designated tmp directory (for example in MacOS this is is a longer path in /var/.....) - so we have to force the default during help generation to always return \"/tmp\" so that the --help images do not change depending on which system you are and what your tmp directory is.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more

I added the DagFileProcessorProcess I did some naughty things with\nsubclassing and lying to the type checker, and this is now stopping us easily\nadding DAG bundles (because as it is structured right now we would have to\nchange both parsing and execution at the same time, or make the type checker\n_even more unhappy_.)\n\nThis more correctly separates the two classes -- essentially anything that\nused `self.client` couldn't have been called from a DagFileProcessorProcess\n(as client was always None for those instances).\n\nThis PR fixes it by adding a new `ActivitySubprocess` which is the type used\nat Execution time (the one that always has the client) and the base behaviour\nkept in WatchedSubprocess.\n\nCloses #45537 as it is an alternative implementation of addressing the same problem\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

the GCSToBigQueryOperator fails with a schema compatibility error when a column defined in the BigQuery schema is missing from the source file. Even if the missing column in BigQuery is configured to allow NULL values, the operator does not handle the missing column gracefully. Instead, it interrupts the pipeline, requiring additional preprocessing steps, such as manually editing the source file to include the missing column, which increases processing overhead and reduces pipeline efficiency.\r\n\r\nUse Case:\r\nFor example, when loading data from an Avro file into BigQuery, if a column present in BigQuery is absent from the Avro file, BigQuery itself can handle this scenario by inserting NULL values. However, the operator does not pass this flexibility to BigQuery, resulting in a schema mismatch error and pipeline failure.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThis Pull Request introduces a new parameter, insert_null_for_missing_columns, to the GCSToBigQueryOperator. When this parameter is set to True, the operator includes the allowMissingFields configuration in the BigQuery load job. This allows BigQuery to insert NULL values for any missing columns in the source file, avoiding schema compatibility errors and ensuring smoother pipeline execution.\r\n\r\nThis change is backward-compatible, as the default behavior (raising a schema compatibility error) is maintained unless the new parameter is explicitly set to True.","created_at":"2025-01-10T14:49:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T16:31:34Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T16:31:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"592cb9e95934be0cd7f7d3f296c8b88f395407dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

SageMaker 64 character length constraint\r\n\r\nSageMakerProcessingJobs have a hard limit of 64 characters for the ProcessingJobName.\r\nIn the SageMakerBaseOperator there is a check for uniqueness for the name. \r\nIn the case that a name is not unique it adds a timestamp to prevent a potential collision, however there is no check to prevent the updated <jobname>-<timestamp> from exceeding 64 characters. This causes the creation of the SageMakerProcessingJob to fail. \r\n\r\nIn the SageMaker Pipelines SDK they truncate the base name before adding the timestamp, therefor we took a similar approach for consistency purposes. \r\n\r\nCloses: #45550 \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Apache Airflow version\r\nmain (development)\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\nPOST request with `content-type` as `application/json; charset=utf-8`\r\n```\r\ncurl -X 'PATCH' \\\r\n  'https://you_host_com/api/v1/dags/dag_id/dagRuns/run_id' \\\r\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\r\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \\\r\n  -d '{\r\n  \"state\": \"success\"\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Problem Description\r\nWhen an API call is made, if the API has the `@action_logging` annotation, the event will be recorded in the db `log` table as follows\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f82db26-96e4-4085-a4e7-3b0f75f880c1)\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\nCurrently, whether the current request contains json_body is determined by judging whether `request.headers.get(\"content-type\")` is equal to `application/json`. The relevant code is as follows\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f67c9a58-44b7-4582-be66-f4b7ace23fbc)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in many cases, the `content-type` contains other information besides `application/json`, such as `application/json; charset=utf-8`.

is #45371, which had to be reverted.\r\n\r\nLet's start parsing DAG bundles! This moves us away from parsing a\r\nsingle local directory to being able to parse many different bundles,\r\nincluding optional support for versioning.\r\n\r\nThis is just the basics - it keeps the parsing loop largely untouched.\r\nWe still have a single list of \"dag files\" to parse, and queue of them.\r\nHowever, instead of just a path, this list and queue now contain\r\n`DagFilePath`s, which hold both a local path and the bundle its from.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things that are not fully functional at this\r\nstage, like versioned callbacks. These will be refactored later. There\r\nis enough churn with the basics (particularly with the number of test\r\nchanges).","created_at":"2025-01-09T23:35:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-13T11:50:21Z","closed_at":"2025-01-13T11:50:19Z","merged_at":"2025-01-13T11:50:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"96645b1680d9bb1c82cbb3943a2e51631585a138","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mobuchowski","id":6503007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDMwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6503007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mobuchowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.

to Slack topic: https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CCR6P6JRL/p1736440079894049\r\n\r\nWe noticed that if a DAG run is set to failed, all tasks are either set to failed or skipped. But if Teardown Tasks are used in a DAG, they are not executed. This could lead to infrastructure or external dependencies not properly cleaned-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior and does NOT fail/skip teardown tasks if a DAG is set to failed.\r\nA side effect as consequence might be that the DAG is after the call NOT failed, else if it would set it to failed, then any teardown task (even if not skipped/failed) will not scheduled anymore.","created_at":"2025-01-09T22:27:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T20:20:18Z","closed_at":"2025-01-11T17:51:21Z","merged_at":"2025-01-11T17:51:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e8977a2ea24e989c6c57ee3cb8e7b6bc4cf6c56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's

is a bulk change that synchronizes dev/ci scripts for v2-10-test branch with main #45266 - including follow-ups.\r\n\r\nRather than cherry-picking relevant PRs, this one gets the latest version of the scripts from main and updates the branch with some changes to adapt them to v2-10-test (such as bringing back python 3.8 support, removing some providers checks after the bulk move of providers and making sure all tests are passing.\r\n\r\nThis is far easier than cherry-picking the changes, because for the v2-10-test we stopped cherry-picking CI changes which was deemed unnecessary (we used to do it for all previous branches) but this made it far more difficult (if not impossible) to cherry-pick individual changes.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the CI scripts are maintained in the way that their latest version **should** in principle work for a v2-* branch and hopefully after just a few adjustments we should be able to synchronize the changes from main by updating all relevant CI/DEV scripts, dockerfile images, workflows, pre-commits etc.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
