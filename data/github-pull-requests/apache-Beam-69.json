href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed.

(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed.

investigating the performance of TPCDS query 83, I noticed that the query plan contains fairly heavy weight tasks. These trigger a Spark warning when the tasks get broadcasted because their serialized size (using Java serialization) is above 1MB. \r\n\r\nThis is both a cleanup of the ParDo translation, but also reduces the serialized size of tasks that include many ParDos.\r\n\r\n- Use subtypes of `DoFnMapPartitionsFactory` to handle the single output and multi-output case, rather than relying on a closure that has to be serialized.\r\n- Use Java default collections rather than immutable Guava collections (Why does this matter for serialization???).\r\n- Use `Collections.emptyList` and similar where applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

for https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23636\r\n\r\nWriting extreme  ( <1677-09-21, >2262-04-12) timestamp values to BigQuery via Storage Write API now fails due to `long overflow` exception, because conversion of timestamp to `micros` is done in `nanos`, overflowing `long` (see detailed analysis in https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23636), although BigQuery supports such dates ([TIMESTAMP range](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#timestamp_type)).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24415\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nCherry pick #24489 into release-2.44.0 branch.\r\n\r\nJustification: #23969 introduced a regression in 2.44.0. It introduces SqlType.TIMESTAMP (micros_instant) logical type when converting from avro logical type TimestampMicros, but this Beam portable logical type is not yet supported in Beam SQL. Similar regression may occur other than Beam SQL where micros_instant is not supported.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
