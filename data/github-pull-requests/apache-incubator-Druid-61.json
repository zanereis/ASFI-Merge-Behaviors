flaky tests in DruidCoordinatorTest\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe following tests in DruidCoordinatorTest are flaky:\r\n- testComputeUnderReplicationCountsPerDataSourcePerTierForSegmentsWithBroadcastRule\r\n- testCoordinatorTieredRun\r\n\r\nThis is because of incorrect logic when using the countDownLatch to check if all the segments from curator events is added. We should only countdown the countDownLatch if the received curator event isChildAdded AND we are able to find the segment related to the curator event from the expected list of segments. \r\n\r\nI have ran the job with the above flaky tests 44 times and all of them pass. See: https://travis-ci.com/github/maytasm/druid/builds/174877686\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes #10127 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDruid(including ZooKeeper launched by Druid's script) outputs logs to log files through redirection of standard console output, in which way after a long time running, the log files can be very large, up to tens or hundreds of GB in size.  This introduces extra work for users to clean or roll those log files to save disk space.\r\n\r\nSince log4j2 is used by Druid to record logs, it's better to take advantage of log4j2's file appender to save log in files directly and roll log files as a default way. \r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n1.  fixes the startup scripts to pass down two variables as system properties to Druid or ZooKeeper process so that log4j.xml knows where to save log files and how to name the log files\r\n2. replaces the console appender in the default log4j2.xml configuration files with `RollingRandomAccessFile` to roll log files and remove expired log files\r\n3. modify the supervisor script(indirectly called by start-xxx scripts) to stop redirect sub-processes' console log to file since there're no console log by default\r\n\r\nWith the these changes , we also provide an easy way for user\r\n1.  to config (through environment variable `DRUID_LOG_DIR`) where to save the log files \r\n2.  to change how long they want to keep log files (in log4j2.xml)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nJUnit 4 is already outdated and should be replaced with JUnit 5. JUnit 5 is more flexible and allows you to implement tests more conveniently and extends the testing capabilities.\r\nDependencies were added for JUnit 5, which later made it possible to write tests in both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5. The corresponding versions of JUnit 5 and surefire plugin were configured, so there will be no problems with running tests\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] Dependencies were added to JUnit-vintage-engine - version 5.7.0-M and JUnit-platform-launcher - version 1.7.0-M1.\r\n- [x]  The surefire plugin versions were updated to 3.0.0-M5, except for the modules: druid.extensions-core.histogram and

Why did you decide to do it this way? -->\r\nIntroduced a new helper method in the `CountSqlAggregator` called `createCountAggregatorFactory`. This method returns a `FilteredAggregatorFactory` in the case where the column is nullable and a regular `CountAggregatorFactory` otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis new helper method is then used in `AvgSqlAggregator` to get the correct null respecting count in the denominator. In order to implement this i've replaced the parent class of `AvgSqlAggregator` from `SimpleSqlAggregator` to a regular `SqlAggregator` because `getAggregation` doesn't expose all the information we need.\r\n\r\n### What should reviewers focus on?\r\n<!--\r\nOutline anything you wish reviewers to pay extra attention to such as:\r\n- What aspects of this work are you particularly unsure about\r\n- How could these changes result in failures?\r\n- List open questions for discussion.\r\n-->\r\nSome areas I would like focus and feedback on:\r\n\r\n- I've switched the simple aggregation test to use the `druid.numfoo` table which has numeric null columns. I did this to have an explicit case of averaging a numeric dimension with nulls.\r\n\r\n- I've modified query plans in other tests because after this change the `avg` aggregate on a metric ended up using a `FilteredAggregatorFactory`. This makes sense to me because you'd have to assume the metric can be null but it also feels weird because the `cnt` metric can't technically be null. So i'm not sure if this is the expected behaviour or not.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

of the general problem of Increase reusability of retention rule configurations is here [Issue #10237 ](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10237)\r\nThis pull request implements a new rule type that imports rules from any other rule set, including rules from other data sources. \r\n\r\n\r\n![sizecheck](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8482587/86393561-3ed6ab80-bc6b-11ea-8521-663126be0475.gif)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis branch adds a new ImportRule type that specifies an imported rule set. Whenever rules are used, they are expanded to include the default rules for the cluster. This changes the getRulesWithDefault to also expand any import rules found at the time they are retrieved. This is functionally equivalent to the original list as the rules are replaced before evaluation. Rules are also used in CoordinatorRuleManager in the router, where getRulesWithDefault was implemented again. Here, that implementation is left at one place, in SQLRuleManager and a new method is added to RulesResource to allow CoordinatorRuleManager to retrieve the expanded list of rules without knowing how it was generated. \r\n\r\nIn the implementation, the function of getRulesWithDefault has diverged a little bit from the name, maybe a name like getExpandedRules would be better. Also, the implementation for ImportRule is specifically in SQLMetadataRuleManager maybe it should be interface methods or in a utility class for use by other implementations in the future. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`CachingClusteredClient.getQueryRunnerForSegments()` can be called when `RetryQueryRunner` retries the query for missing segments. Since it is possible to query only a subset of core partition set per time chunk, `CachingClusteredClient` should use `TimelineLookup.lookupWithIncompletePartitions()` instead. The query can return incomplete result otherwise. Maybe later, it is possible to refactor `CachingClusteredClient.getQueryRunnerForSegments()` to use the given segments as they are instead of creating a timeline with them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Stack overflow with infinite loop in ReduceExpressionsRule of HepProgram\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fix https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9906\r\n\r\nDue to Calcite bug (CALCITE-3845), ReduceExpressionsRule can considered expression which is the same as the previous input expression as reduced. Basically, the expression is actually not reduced but is still considered as reduced. Hence, this resulted in an infinite loop of Calcite trying to reducing the same expression over and over in ReduceExpressionsRule. Calcite 1.23.0 fixes this issue by not consider expression as reduced if this case happens. However, while we are still using Calcite 1.21.0, a workaround is to limit the number of pattern matches to avoid infinite loop in ReduceExpressionsRule of the HepProgram. One example of this case is the query `SELECT ARRAY ['Hello', NULL]`\r\n\r\nThe matchLimit value of 1200 is chosen with suggestion by a Calcite committer, Chunwei Lei. (See: https://lists.apache.org/x/thread.html/rea7691aec3947a49faaa29cdfba4ef5d0a5e1da2c3b7546ae8dea3c8@%3Cdev.calcite.apache.org%3E). Note: Chunwei recommendation is based on MaxCompute (https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/maxcompute),  a big data computing and\r\nstorage platform. MaxCompute uses Calcite for cost-based query optimization. MaxCompute has similar usage of the HepProgram as Druid which is to reduce the search space (do some optimizations, such as column pruning, predicate pushdown, and so on), before entering VolcanoPlanner.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with/modifies the behavior of closing a `Yielder` created from a `ParallelMergeCombiningSequence` to trigger a cancellation to immediately halt any additional processing on the broker's merging `ForkJoinPool`. I'm unsure if this causes any issues in practice, but could be an issue if closing a yielder early. Closing the yielder and stopping processing would potentially cause running pool tasks associated with the query to managed block until the offer/poll timeouts on the blocking queue, at which point they would fully die.\r\n\r\nAmusingly, prior to the change in this PR, you could continue to use the \"closed\" yielder to get the complete set of results assuming no exceptions occur inside of the parallel merge processing itself, however the sequence 'baggage' that reports the parallel merge pool metrics would have been triggered early, reporting incorrect metric values.\r\n\r\nThe added test ensures that cancellation happens upon close of the `Yielder`, which is valid behavior within the contract of the `Yielder` interface which allows for close to put the entire chain into an undefined state.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue flagged by LGTM. It prevents `..` and `/` characters from being used in the authorizer name so that the authorizer APIs can not be abused to access files on the overlord. Only a Druid admin can access these APIs, so it is assumed that this admin already has access to the same files on the server that Druid has access to.\r\n\r\nWhen an admin provides an authorizer name via system properties, no validation is done at this point, but it might be worth considering in the future.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR Fixes a bug with groupBy query cache key. The current cache key for groupby queries does not contain limitSpec info. So when a user queries with a given limit lets say 10 and then increase the limit to 100, he would still get the cached results with older limit. \r\n\r\nNote: This only shows up if you have enabled caching for groupby queries, which is enabled by default from 0.13 release. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [*] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [*] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [*] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nIn 0.19, Brokers gained the ability to serve segments. To support this change,\r\na `BROKER` ServerType was added to `druid.server.coordination`.\r\n\r\nDruid nodes prior to this change do not know of this new server type and so\r\nthey would fail to deserialize this node's announcement.\r\n\r\nThis change makes it so that the broker only announces itself if the segment\r\ncache is configured on the broker. It is expected that a Druid admin will only\r\nconfigure the segment cache on the broker once the cluster has been upgraded\r\nto a version that supports a broker using the segment cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#10057.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNative batch range partitioning was only considering the partition dimension value when grouping rows instead of using all of the row's partition values. Thus, for schemas with multiple dimensions, the rollup was overestimated, which would cause too many dimension values to be packed into the same range partition. The resulting segments would then be overly large (and not honor the target or max partition sizes).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `PartialDimensionDistributionTask`: Consider all dimension values when grouping row\r\n* `RangePartitionMultiPhaseParallelIndexingTest`: Regression test by having input with rows that should roll up and rows that should not roll

Description\r\n\r\n`RetryQueryRunner` is responsible for retrying the query when some segments are missing during the query (it's possible since the coordinator can move segments anytime). However, it currently doesn't work as expected since it checks the missing segments in the response context _before_ issuing the query to the query nodes. This PR fixes this bug and adds a sanity check that makes checking missing segments failed if the broker hasn't gotten all responses from the query nodes yet.\r\n\r\nSome integration tests will be added as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

return type consistent for HyperUniquesAggregator and HyperUniquesVectorAggregator when no value found\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis bug was discovered by turning on vectorization. In HyperUniquesAggregator, when a column is empty, `collector` will be null and the get() method will returns null. In HyperUniquesVectorAggregator, when a column is empty, get() method will still returns a HyperLogLogCollector (from the call to `HyperUniquesBufferAggregator.doGet(buf, position);`). In HyperUniquesAggregatorFactory#estimateCardinality (called by HyperUniquesAggregatorFactory#finalizeComputation) we return integer 0 if input is null, while we return long/double value. otherwise. Hence, for the above mentioned case, the non-vectorize returns integer 0 while the vectorize returns long/double 0. The test failed since we are expecting integer 0. \r\nThis PR, make sure that for the case when the input to HyperUniquesAggregatorFactory#estimateCardinality is null, we still return 0 with the same value type as when it is not null.  \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes part of https://support.imply.io/hc/en-us/requests/5701\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe ran into an issue whereby a 500 when getting records from kinesis would cause the thread to stop until the end of `taskDuration`. This would cause our ingestion to fall behind. We filed a support ticket with AWS regarding the 500s and were basically told that those should be retried by the client and they should be expected in the normal operation of Kinesis. The same advice is echoed at https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/kinesis-data-stream-500-error/\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThe only change here is errors with status codes 500 and 503 are now considered retryable.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

PR is a follow-on to #10015, which adds a new `toOptimizedFilter()` method to `DimFilter` and adjusts how filter optimization is applied (with changes to the query toolchests and the `Filters` utility class).\r\n\r\nGeneral filter optimization for queries is now applied in the `Filters.toFilter` method instead of in each query toolchest's preMergeDecoration.\r\n\r\nThis change is made for two reasons:\r\n- The `toOptimizedFilter` method requires that the returned value be cached, and a new `AbstractOptimizableDimFilter` base class has been added to provide this functionality to all of the existing DimFilters. This caching behavior helps performance for cases like the sanity check here (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/join/HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter.java#L227) by avoiding deep comparisons.\r\n- The filter optimization should happen before join filter pre-analysis for join queries, this PR adjusts the join filter pre-analysis to call `toOptimizedFilter()` on the DimFilter it's given from the query. This means that the per-segment processing threads will be able to access a cached Filter object from the DimFilter.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x]

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with TopN algorithm selection to make sure that string columns with dictionaries also have sorted and unique dictionaries. The off-heap pooled algorithm assumes this to be true, so we must use the heap based algorithm in cases where the column has a dictionary, but it is not unique or sorted.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the added test produces the following incorrect results before this patch:\r\n```\r\n2020-06-18T18:52:21,520 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.BaseCalciteQueryTest - row #0: [a, 3]\r\n2020-06-18T18:52:21,520 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.BaseCalciteQueryTest - row #1: [a, 3]\r\n2020-06-18T18:52:21,520 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.BaseCalciteQueryTest - row #2: [a, 3]\r\n2020-06-18T18:52:21,520 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.BaseCalciteQueryTest - row #3: [b, 3]\r\n```\r\nThis test covers a ton more surface than just this condition since it tests it via a join to a broadcast `GlobalTableDataSource`. `CalciteQueryTest` may now test against an `IndexedTable` joinable version of the `numfoo` test datasource (without the metrics columns), which is wired up into the segment walker to mimic a broadcast segment that is present on the broker, so that in the `DruidSchema` it will be translated into a `GlobalTableDataSource` instead of a `TableDataSource`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

#9467 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNative single dim indexing throws a file not found exception from\r\nInputEntityIteratingReader.java:81.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the temporary directory creation step into `TaskTookBox.getIndexingTmpDir` so that the directory will be automatically created.  It also removes directory creation code from other callers `TaskTookBox.getIndexingTmpDir` since they no longer need to create the directory themselves.\r\n\r\nThe change was tested on a Druid cluster.  After installing the change native single_dim indexing\r\ncompletes successfully.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in

Description\r\n\r\nThis function is similar to `regexp_replace` functions offered by other databases like\r\npostgres and oracle.\r\n\r\nThis function unlocks a few use-cases\r\n\r\n* Name rearrangement\r\n\r\nIf a column stores the name as first last, but you would prefer the report\r\nto be displayed as last, first\r\n\r\n`SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE('John Doe','(.*) (.*)','$2, $1');`\r\n\r\n* String removal\r\n\r\nIf you'd prefer to replace a string that matches a pattern - for example\r\nemail addresses that might be in a text column, you can replace the pattern\r\nwith generic text so that queries don't accidentally leak data.\r\n\r\n`SELECT DISTINCT REGEXP_REPLACE(diffUrl, 'diff=\\d*', 'diff=****'`) from wikipedia`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\nThis PR extends #10020 to more correctly only convert a `TableDataSource` to a `GlobalTableDataSource` if it is also joinable. In service to this, the `JoinableFactory` interface has been modified to add a new method:\r\n```\r\nboolean isDirectlyJoinable(DataSource dataSource);\r\n```\r\nwhich should return `true` if for a `JoinableFactory` and a `DataSource` may possibly produce a `Joinable` for at least some `JoinAnalysis`, directly, that is without a subquery join. This is useful, because `DataSource.isGlobal` is used to determine whether or not a subquery is necessary to complete the join. I left some notes in javadocs and comments on how we should consider using this new method in query planning and processing so that we might decouple the idea that a datasource is globally distributed among the cluster and whether or not a joinable can be directly built for it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it adds automatic conversion of `TableDataSource` to `GlobalTableDataSource` for native druid queries whenever eligible, to make `GlobalTableDataSource` an internal construct.\r\n\r\nTo make these changes visible, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES table now has two additional columns: `IS_JOINABLE` and `IS_BROADCAST`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"984\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-17 at 11 34 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/84986270-25722300-b0f3-11ea-9166-75efbcb839e3.png\">\r\n\r\n* `IS_JOINABLE` means that a `Joinable` can possibly be built for that table during query execution, allowing the right hand side of a join to be performed without issuing a subquery.\r\n* `IS_BROADCAST` means that the table is distributed to all query processing servers (historicals, brokers, indexers/realtime tasks). Note that this value will be incorrect for broadcast datasources in clusters where the broker is not configured to serve broadcast segments, due to inferring if a datasource is broadcast by checking the brokers local segment cache. A future improvement might be to swap this out for something that examines the load rules instead of guessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9352. First PR of https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10045.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is implemented on top of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10025 (you can see only the changes for this PR here: https://github.com/jihoonson/druid/compare/hash-partition-core-set...jihoonson:append-dynamic).\r\n\r\nThis PR allows appending to existing datasources if the appended segments are partitioned using the `dynamic` partitionsSpec. The main change is found in `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator`, which used to return null in `createNewSegment()` if the partitionsSpec is not compatible. It now allows segments to have mixed types of shardSpecs and finds the proper partitionId using a new method `ShardSpec.sharePartitionSpace()`.\r\n\r\nA note for downgrade is that, as `SingleDimensionShardSpec` is changed to use `NumberedPartitionChunk` 1) to decouple partitionId and bucketId and 2) to allow append, the operators should be aware of that the appended segments to a range-partitioned datasource will be not recognized by Druid after downgrade. To avoid this, they should compact the segments in the core partitions and appended segments in each time chunk before downgrade.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are new unit tests to verify the behavior. The added tests include\r\n\r\n- tuningConfig test: allow only dynamic if appendToExisting = true\r\n- Append test\r\n- With time chunk lock\r\n  - Append dynamically partitioned segments to a dynamically partitioned datasource\r\n  - Append dynamically partitioned segments to a hash-partitioned datasource\r\n  - Append dynamically partitioned segments to a range-partitioned datasource\r\n  - Compact segments of mixed shardSpecs\r\n- With segment lock\r\n  - Append dynamically partitioned segments to a dynamically partitioned datasource\r\n  - Overwrite a datasource with segment lock and append dynamically partitioned segments\r\n  - Compact a subset of segments of mixed shardSpecs in each time chunk\r\n\r\nIntegration tests are still missing, I will add them in a follow-up pr.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Presently, [UnionDataSource](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/datasource.html#union) is the only datasource within druid under this category. For more details on the usecase, please refer to the proposal.\r\n`UnionDataSource` has been refactored to be an implementation of `MultiTableDataSource`. As a result, union datasource queries no longer execute sequentially per datasource and this improves the query performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

guava[version=16.0.1] to  the latest guava[version=29.0]. it's the same result. \r\n\r\nAccords to source code in guava[version=16.0.1], when someone future occurs error, it will set the state of

aggregators should check if column can be vectorize\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAll aggregators should check if column can be vectorize. The bug is caused by the fact that the canVecotrize method of the aggregators only look at the aggregator class. This is incomplete as whether we can or cannot vectorize also depends on the column type. For example, vector object selector isn’t implemented for strings. (String columns have dimension vector selectors just not implemented to use them as aggregator inputs since they have different interfaces).\r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR is to make canVectorize method of aggregators take an argument that have access to the column capabilities so they can check all fields of the aggregator. Each aggregator will then use the argument (argument to canVecotrize mentioned above) to get column capabilities for the field and make the necessary check to make sure that the column type can be vectorized for that particular aggregator. (For example, DoubleSumAggregatorFactory must be Numeric ValueType)  \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe bug with hash/range partitioning schemes is a bit different from #10012. With hash/range partitioning, the task sets some size of the core partitions, but it could be wrong. More precisely, there can be some empty partitions in the core partitions. If that's the case, those segments will never become online on brokers. This can happen because the batch ingestion task allocates all partitionIds upfront before it starts ingestion. However, if your data is highly skewed, some hash/range buckets can be empty even after the task consumed all inputs. Since Druid doesn't create empty partitions, those empty buckets will be missing in the core partitions which make the other segments to never become online.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by postponing the partitionId allocation until all empty buckets are identified. To do so, the partitionId and bucketId are now decoupled. The shardSpec for hash partitioning is:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @JsonCreator\r\n  public HashBasedNumberedShardSpec(\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"partitionNum\") int partitionNum,    // partitionId\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"partitions\") int partitions,        // core partition set size\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"bucketId\") @Nullable Integer bucketId, // nullable for backward compatibility\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"numBuckets\") @Nullable Integer numBuckets, // nullable for backward compatibility\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"partitionDimensions\") @Nullable List<String> partitionDimensions,\r\n      @JacksonInject ObjectMapper jsonMapper\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    super(partitionNum, partitions);\r\n    // Use partitionId as bucketId if it's missing.\r\n    this.bucketId = bucketId == null ? partitionNum : bucketId;\r\n    // If numBuckets is missing, assume that any hash bucket is not empty.\r\n    // Use the core partition set size as the number of buckets.\r\n    this.numBuckets = numBuckets == null ? partitions : numBuckets;\r\n    this.jsonMapper = jsonMapper;\r\n    this.partitionDimensions = partitionDimensions == null ? DEFAULT_PARTITION_DIMENSIONS : partitionDimensions;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bucketId is allocated upfront when all buckets are created, but the partitionId is dynamically allocated when a bucket is actually in use. To implement this, a new interface (`BucketNumberedShardSpec`) and its implementations were added. \r\n\r\n`BuildingHashBasedNumberedShardSpec` was also added to address the same issue in #10012 for hash partitioning. Finally, two fields of `bucketId` and `numBuckets` were added in `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` to decouple the core partitions and the hash buckets.\r\n\r\nThe same technique was implemented for the range partitioning as well. This is because 1) the range partitioning has the same issue and 2) it's harder to fix only hash partitioning part. As a result, a new field `numCorePartitions` was added in `SingleDimensionShardSpec` which is initialized to -1 if it's missing. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @JsonCreator\r\n  public SingleDimensionShardSpec(\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"dimension\") String dimension,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"start\") @Nullable String start,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"end\") @Nullable String end,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"partitionNum\") int partitionNum,\r\n      @JsonProperty(\"numCorePartitions\") @Nullable Integer numCorePartitions // nullable for backward compatibility\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    Preconditions.checkArgument(partitionNum >= 0, \"partitionNum >= 0\");\r\n    this.dimension = Preconditions.checkNotNull(dimension, \"dimension\");\r\n    this.start = start;\r\n    this.end = end;\r\n    this.partitionNum = partitionNum;\r\n    this.numCorePartitions = numCorePartitions == null ? UNKNOWN_NUM_CORE_PARTITIONS : numCorePartitions;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, now `SingleDimensionShardSpec` uses the same mechanism with `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` to check the completeness of the core partition set, it creates `NumberedPartitionChunk` in `createChunk()`.\r\n\r\nThe changes in `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` and `SingleDimensionShardSpec` should be compatible with older versions; Druid still can read segments created in older versions. The segments created with the new field is still readable in older versions of druid. However, those segments might not become online after downgrade if there are empty buckets in the core partitions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nAvoid unnecessary coupling of test classes. Having independent classes\r\nmakes it easier to understand and modify them.\r\n\r\nThe two classes that extended CompressionStrategyTest didn't have a lot\r\nin common with it. All of them are parameterized tests where the\r\nparameter is a CompressionStrategy. Therefore they used the parent class\r\nto store the value of the strategy.
