Instead, a placeholder is shown\r\n- When new chart is created, the default title is empty instead of \"- untitled\", which means that we display the placeholder\r\n- Editing the name of existing chart gets recorded in \"Altered\" table\r\n- if user doesn't have edit permissions, instead of an input element display span element that looks and behaves the same except for editing capabilities\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n- move timer, rows retrieved and cached labels to chart container (implemented in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19458)\r\n- move save button to the right of chart header \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/161726241-ffdf4019-4904-4ef0-8efd-b0fa749fdd36.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a chart that you have permissions to edit\r\n2. Click the title, verify that cursor appears\r\n3. When there's no text a placeholder should appear\r\n4. When you start typing, the input's width should adjust to its content\r\n5. When input is wider than the header container, it should move to the position of cursor if in edit mode, or be truncated if not in edit mode\r\n6. If not editing and title is truncated, display tooltip with full title on hover \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe are doing a longer survey of the older api endpoints and migrating them to api/v1\r\n\r\nDuring this we noticed that this particular endpoint is no longer being used in superset, nor is it publicly listed or in the swagger, therefore I think that it is ready to be depreciated, and potentially gotten rid of in the next major release. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe Alert/Report list doesn't have a creator column, yet there's a \"created by\" filter for it.\r\nThis creates an inconsistency for the user, that has a filter that is not visually represented in the table.\r\nFurthermore, the table has some inconsistencies in the display with other tables in the system around these fields, like the dashboard ones.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves both, by adding the created by field to the table & allow the user to sort by both created by and owners.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/161585875-cfb61ba4-a7be-4026-8875-377dd23674b6.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/161585174-13b47f16-4bfb-4b21-862d-49b828389bee.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to the reports view\r\n2. Add one report with user A (current user) as owner\r\n3. Add one report with user A & user B as owners\r\n\r\nEnsure that the owner & created by fields display correctly.\r\nEnsure that the owner & created by filters work by filtering by their respective fields accordingly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR #18936 that deprecated time range endpoints (breaking change for 2.0) included a migration that had to be changed into a NOOP for 1.5.0 (https://github.com/apache/superset/commit/2001fb5037e10a06e878dbfbcdaa1fd204a8f16a), as there were critical migrations after that PR that needed to go into the LTS v1 branch. This changes the original migration to a NOOP and adds a new migration that performs the same operation. This will ensure that both users that are running master branch, and orgs that run official releases, will have had the same migration logic applied to their metadata.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently the CI logs output a lot of useless information.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe dashboard edit view get's cut off (hidden behind) when the dashboard header is bigger than usual.\r\nThis can happen if the dashboard title occupies more than one line, making the header bigger, or when editing the title.\r\n\r\nThe reason is because the edit view is sticky, and the top is hardcoded.\r\nThis PR calculates the top offset of the edit view based on the dashboard header view, so that it looks correctly regardless of size.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/161122189-d8bc089e-c9b3-4d51-9f01-bdbd3ec1a4f3.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/161121941-3be7dfe7-c6be-4102-9601-b5cc88269916.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard\r\n2. In edit mode, edit the dashboard title to be more than one line long\r\n\r\nEnsure the edit view tabs are still visible.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic,

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR #19223 caused a regression due to trying to query for `saved_query` objects by their owners, despite the model only having a creator (there is no `saved_query_user`, like there is for `dashboard_user` for `dashboards` and `slice_user` for `slices`). This renames the `getUserOwnedObjects` to `getUserObjects` and adds a parameter `filterBy` which makes it possible to define whether or not to query by `owners` or `created_by`.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter the change, the welcome page loads without errors:\r\n<img width=\"1660\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/161073736-38973eaf-5fa7-45ae-874a-17fa82042986.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously there was an error toast caused by a 400:\r\n<img width=\"1667\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/161073889-44bf0d17-9b21-4890-87f9-f18bec634c3c.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently samples are requested with the original row limit, which tends to be 10k. However, samples should by default return 1k rows. This changes the frontend logic to remove `row_limit` and `row_offset` from the requested query object so the backend can use the appropriate defaults. The reason this is done in the frontend is to ensure that it's still possible to paginate samples requests if needed. Also clean up some incorrect types + add `__future__` annotations for cleaner python sig types.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter the change the samples tab only displays 1k rows\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/161026082-611b5f20-d6a2-4ca5-84b6-6b6b1cb646ab.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously it would request 10k rows if the row limit control was set to 10k:\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/161026257-762076f3-f39a-469f-b4a1-b2d73a2ca396.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nImprove the `validate_adhoc_subquery` function.\r\n\r\nI changed the logic of `insert_rls`. As originally written we'd pass (1) the adhoc SQL, (2) the dataset name and (3) the associated RLS predicate. In order to use it here I modified it to receive (1) the adhoc SQL with the (2) database and (3) schema where it will run. We then parse the adhoc SQL, and for each table found we check if there's an associated RLS rule; if so, we modify the SQL to include the RLS predicate(s).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

`Cannot convert object to primitive value` error appears in the developer console when trying to format the data coming from Presto. This issue causes the SQL Lab to crash. This can be sorted by stringifying the row data.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe SQL Lab crashes when data coming from Presto contains non primitive values. This fix basically catches the exception that occurs and recovers by formatting the row data using `JSON.stringify`. It does the trick in our case.\r\nWe also had a look at fixing this on the [presto db engine spec](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py) but couldn't really fix it over there.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"845\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 12 56 53\"

a Presto datasource that returns nested data that blows up the SQL Lab when it's getting formatted in a tabulated way.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:

SUMMARY\r\nNon certified dashboards appear on dashboard list when filtering by certified\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBEFORE:\r\nIn case of certified filter is

Certify some dashboards (This can be done from the dashboard CRUD view > edit > certified fields at the bottom of the modal)\r\n2. Go to the dashboard list\r\n3. Should show only certificated Dashboards when the filter option of certified is Yes.\r\n\r\nGenerally, You will not reproduce this issue anymore with dashboard CRUD. This issue is happened when the certified_by field value is empty string, not null value.(like following image). and so I had a test after changing this forcely into empty string in some dashboards value and then could catch this issue and fix it.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47900232/160802645-9b6f455f-a935-4f94-b728-96584a345710.png)\r\n\r\nOr you can see this issue on

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is another take on #19406 and #19416. The goal is to rewrite the bulk of loading + rewriting operations from Python to native SQL statements by utilizing `INSERT SELECT FROM`.\r\n\r\nThe whole migration happens in 3 steps:\r\n\r\n1. Copy `tables`, `table_columns`, `sql_metrics` to the new `sl_xxx` tables using INSERT SELECT FROM.\r\n2. Copy model associations to relationship tables.\r\n3. Run post processing on `sl_datastes` and `sl_columns` to\r\n   - Tuck additional metadata columns (`verbose_name`, `d3format`, etc) in the original tables under `extra_json`\r\n   - Add conditional quotes to physical table and column expressions\r\n   - Apply dataset level `is_managed_externally` and `external_url` to columns\r\n\r\nComparing to #19406, this PR was able to cut down the migration time for our Superset instance from 7 hours to 1 hour while retaining the full functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile working on the migration, I also noticed a couple of shortcomings in the original implementation, including problems in the shadow-writing logic. Most notably:\r\n\r\n1. Some long text columns should use `MediumText` for MySQL\r\n2. Columns are not automatically deleted when they are unlinked from a table or dataset (e.g. when you modify or remove a column from a dataset)\r\n3. Letting physical table and dataset point to the same columns could be problematic as we wouldn't want users who updated column properties in a dataset to automatically propagate that change to the related table. Tables and datasets may have different ownerships and different users may create different physical datasets for different tables. One of the original goal of SIP-68 was to change the mapping between physical datasets and database table/views to an n:1 relationship. It only makes sense if column definitions in each dataset are independent as well.\r\n4. Dataset does not know which database it belongs to unless being joined with a table. However, a dataset does not always have an associated table---for example, we can have virtual queries like \"SELECT 1;\" that does not populate data from any tables. Or, the table name extraction for a complex SQL statement could fail (especially when it has Jinja syntax).\r\n\r\nInstead of creating multiple db migrations to address these issues, it'd be much easier for end users if we just skip the original migration (drop data for who already migrated) and bundle everything in another migration:\r\n\r\n1. Datasets and columns now reuse uuids from the old tables. This makes filling up the association tables easier. It also makes it possible to import a Superset export from an old Superset instance that hasn't upgrade to the new models, even after the old models have been removed.\r\n2. `created_on`, `change_on`, `created_by` and `changed_by` are also copied over when appropriate.\r\n3. In MySQL, some text columns (`expression`, `description`, etc) are now `MediumText`. This is consistent with current column types in the old tables.\r\n4. Since old and new entities can now be linked via `uuid`, `sqlatable_id` on `NewDataset` is removed. However, there is no 1:1 mapping of `NewTable` in the old models so they acquires uuids. In order to link `NewTable` with associated columns, `sqlatable_id` is added to `NewTable` during the db migration, but dropped once migration is complete.\r\n5. Refactored shadow-writing hooks to reduce duplicate code and more appropriately handle column deletion.\r\n6. Removed column fetching for tables. We used to fetch table metadata (column types, etc) from datasources during db migration, as well as in shadowing writing, but this has a major risk---external datasources can be unreliably slow. Users could fail the migration or saving edits to a datasource if the datasource is temporarily down. We should not let this unreliable process block the critical path of basic functionalities. I added a `Table.sync_columns` method, but in the future this should be consolidated with `get_virtual_table_metadata` and `get_physical_table_metadata`.\r\n7. `dataset.owners` are also added (copying PR #19487).\r\n\r\n#### Known issues and next steps\r\n\r\n1. The table columns for `NewTable` will only be copied from the dataset when its being created. We'd need another mechanism to sync table columns. Either during re-populating after `fetch_metadata` or in an async script. Since the Table model is not used anywhere yet, I think it's okay to leave this in another followup PR.\r\n2. I added a [`sync_columns`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/03295342428faff6958f7a4a1181ac69bb88c6fd/superset/tables/models.py#L122) method for tables. It's not currently in use and does more or less the same as `SqlaTable.fetch_metadata`. I think it's okay to keep this somewhat-duplicate not-in-active-use method as `SqlaTable` will be remove eventually.\r\n3. In this PR, `NewTable.columns` will be updated only when a **physical** `SqlaTable` is first synced to the new models and a `NewTable` is created. Updating columns in a `SqlaTable` dataset will NOT update `SqlaTable.columns` as we consider table columns and dataset columns to be separate and the metadata syncing should only happen in one direction---that is from tables to datasets, not the other way around.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"image\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performance on the SIP-68 migration script by using `sqloxide` (https://pypi.org/project/sqloxide/) to parse the SQL when extracting dependencies. In case the parsing fails it falls back to using `sqlparse`.\r\n\r\nIt also addresses a few bugs:\r\n\r\n- Tables were assigned incorrectly to datasets because of the lack of the database id in the predicate (also fixed in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19406).\r\n- Datasets where incorrectly flagged as virtual when their `sql` was an empty string.\r\n- Datasets incorrectly flagged as virtual would have all tables associated with them, since the predicate was empty.\r\n- Tables referenced in virtual datasets but not present as physical datasets were not being created.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ superset db downgrade 5afbb1a5849b\r\n$ superset db upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nMigration still works and relationships are populated correctly. We can see all the datasets and the associated tables with this query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  sl_datasets.name AS dataset_name,\r\n  sl_datasets.is_physical,\r\n  sl_datasets.expression,\r\n  ARRAY_AGG(sl_tables.name) AS table_names\r\nFROM sl_datasets\r\nJOIN sl_dataset_tables\r\n  ON sl_datasets.id = sl_dataset_tables.dataset_id\r\nJOIN sl_tables\r\n  ON sl_dataset_tables.table_id = sl_tables.id\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2, 3\r\nORDER BY 2 DESC;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       dataset_name        | is_physical |

SUMMARY\r\nA previous commit removed the `FaveStar` component and the `id` column with it from the dashboards list view for anonymous users. This broke the `CERTIFIED` filter because it also depends on the `id` column.\r\nThis PR re-adds the id column, but removes the favorite star and hides the column if the user is not logged in. Also removing the stars from the `DashboardCard` component if not applicable.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Before ####\r\nAnonymous user, list/card view:\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160627257-1486fe28-63d5-4b43-93d7-7e925d16cbb2.png\">\r\n\r\nLogged in user, dashboard (*for reference, not supposed to change*):\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160627067-9e791ee9-ec05-43ba-9fcd-6c8ad43212de.png\">\r\n\r\nLogged in user, list view (*for reference, not supposed to change*):\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160627128-0f1e0547-d5b6-4cf8-9250-78dc4e351141.png\">\r\n\r\nLogged in user, card view (*for reference, not supposed to change*):\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160627181-d33b4712-9445-44a6-a0e9-fe819f1e1279.png\">\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\nAnonymous user, list view:\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160624102-95c050ae-b702-43b7-8981-c9250ef0786b.png\">\r\n\r\nAnonymous user, card view:\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160624177-51f2904e-57d8-462f-85b4-e432fdbd7e1a.png\">\r\n\r\nLogged in user, dashboard (*not supposed to change visually, but screenshot is included because some components are modified*):\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160624411-a1af82b0-cbb7-41ec-82e1-7a53ff85dcd2.png\">\r\n\r\nLogged in user, list view (*not supposed to change visually, but screenshot is included because some components are modified*):\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160624579-d6e3713e-d565-45c3-8cdf-2ee9441fb8b7.png\">\r\n\r\nLogged in user, card view (*not supposed to change visually, but screenshot is included because some components are modified*):\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893357/160624819-4b42afbc-5c24-4dea-8f84-24a7dd9acd6e.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAutomated tests added for both logged in/anonymous cases for table and card view.\r\n\r\nFor manual testing add \r\n```python\r\nPUBLIC_ROLE_LIKE = \"Gamma\"\r\n```\r\nto `docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py` and run `docker compose up`.\r\n\r\nLog in as admin and add the `all datasource access on all_datasource_access` and `all database access on all_database_access` permissions to the public role.\r\n\r\nAfter logging out, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/superset/dashboards/list](http://localhost:3000/superset/dashboards/list) and the dashboard list should open without an error and the CERTIFIED filter should work and the favorite star should not be present on the list view nor the table view.

SUMMARY\r\nAdd empty state to dashboard tabs (top level and normal ones) if they contain no components\r\n\r\n1. Top level tabs - if user has dashboard edit permissions, they see an additional description and a button that triggers edit mode. In edit mode, text changes and button redirects to \"add chart\" page\r\n2. Regular tabs - if user has dashboard edit permissions, they see an additional description. The description contains a link button that triggers edit mode. In edit mode, text changes and the link button redirects to \"add chart\" page.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I added \"Edit dashboard\" button to 1 of old empty states (whole dashboard is empty) for consistency.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/160612415-1aff4c5b-cdb6-4890-aeab-8fb556d50df8.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard\r\n2. Add top level tabs\r\n3. Verify that empty state appears and button redirects to add chart\r\n4. Save dashboard and verify that text changed and the button redirects to edit mode\r\n5. Add normal tabs\r\n6. Verify that \"top level\" empty state disappears, instead there's an empty state in newly added tabs. A link button in description should redirect to add chart page.\r\n7. Save chart, verify that text changed and link button redirects to edit mode.\r\n8. Change user to a one withtout dashboard edit permissions, verify that descriptions/buttons don't appear\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWe run into some scalability issues with the db migration script for [SIP-68](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14909) (PR #17543). For context, we have more than 165k datasets, 1.9 million columns and 345k metrics. Loading all of them in memory and convert them to the new tables in one giant commit, like current implementation does, is impractical. It'd kill the Python process if not the db connection.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to optimize this migration script by:\r\n1. **Adding pagination:** instead of migrate all datasets & columns in one commit, I added a manual pagination to fetch datasets 100 at a time.  SQLA streaming with [yield_per](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Query.yield_per) may also be an option but it's more complicated when read and write are interlaced with each other---SQLA will complain `iter_next` is impossible because entities have changed.\r\n2. **Committing changes in small batches:** use [autocommit_block()](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/api/runtime.html#alembic.runtime.migration.MigrationContext.autocommit_block) to move write operations for each dataset out of the [per-migration transaction](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b3db6140c88106fedebe91db0ca817eca4234dc8/superset/migrations/env.py#L117) so new entities are written to the database faster. This avoids keeping all loaded and created entities in memory, either on the Python side or in db buffer. I'm placing the autocommit block around each dataset instead of each page---i.e., writing the dataset and all related columns for each SqlTable in one transaction instead of writing all datasets and all columns from one page of SqlTables in one transaction, as this is tested to be the fastest configuration. Also tested different page sizes and 20 seemed to be working the best. 2,000 datasets can be converted in under 3 minutes. The average memory usage is less than 350MB while writing is in progress.\r\n3. **Use eager loading:** added `lazy=\"selectin\"` to enable [`SELECT IN`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/orm_related_objects.html?highlight=selectin#selectin-load) eager loading that pulls related data in one SQL statement instead of three.\r\n\r\nAfter this optimization, the migration for our 165k datasets took about **7 hours** to finish. Still slow, but better than not able to finish at all. Ideally, in the future, for large full-table migrations like this, the script should be written with raw SQL as much as possible for each dialect we support. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n- Tested locally with our large internal database.\r\n- Added following filters [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b8e1999b943b121259f56f53e3906e59721159ea/superset/migrations/versions/b8d3a24d9131_new_dataset_models.py#L513) to test db records generated for specific data tables:\r\n  ```python\r\n            .filter(\r\n                or_(\r\n                    SqlaTable.table_name == \"my_table_name\",\r\n                    SqlaTable.sql.like(\"%my_table_name%\"),\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n  ```\r\n- Verified values of created entities in MySQL shell via selected SELECT queries:\r\n   ```SQL\r\n    SELECT `schema`, `name`, `is_physical` from sl_datasets limit 10;\r\n    SELECT count(*) from sl_columns;\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

this over from superset-ui (some discussion was on the old PR)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1423\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAdd the ability for the end user to drag and drop columns for a table visualization\r\n\r\nTable designer can enable column rearrangement in the config options when building the table. Then, user can drag columns around\r\n\r\nThese are **volatile changes**, so when the browser is refreshed, the column order goes back to default. Demo is in the chart edit page, which is just for simple demonstration purposes. This is intended for the end user to be allowed to rearrange the columns.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThe current output column in the Query History table in the SQL Lab currently displays the schema if the query failed.\r\nThe resulting UI is a column with \"View results\" button for successful queries and some seemingly random text if the query failed that lacks the appropriate context.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes some cosmetic changes that include:\r\n* Removing the schema for failed queries and leaving the field blank\r\n* Renaming the column from \"output\" to \"results\"\r\n* Renaming the button for successful queries from \"View results\" to \"View\"\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the virtual table is unable to sync `is temporal` flag. This is due to the `SupersetResultSet` response `is_date` instead of `is_dttm`. We should keep the physical table and virtual table have the same interface. \r\n\r\nIn this PR also introduce a new type `superset.superset_typing.ResultSetColumnType` to guarantee type checking.\r\n\r\nI will address a separate PR to finish `PhysicalColumnType`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/160112782-20110704-6a84-4004-b8d2-3c889871b2a1.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
