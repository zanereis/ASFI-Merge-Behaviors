current `docker-compose.yml` file is not compatible with the docker-compose version packaged by some widely used Linux distributions. For instance, Debian bullseye (current stable) [packages docker-compose 1.25.0](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/docker-compose).\r\n\r\ndocker-compose 1.25.0 [supports up to compose file format 3.7](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.25.0) and requires the version to be explicitly set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.\r\n\r\nBy setting the version of the `docker-compose.yml` file to 3.7 we support docker-compose 1.22.0+ and the only required change is adding the \"version\" field. Also, [version 3 has not been deprecated](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/).\r\n\r\nFinally, `run.sh` accepts a gremlin-server version as argument, however it is not used when running tests. This PR also fixes this.\r\n\r\nI have tested this PR both with docker-compose 1.25.0 and 2.6.0 (latest docker-ce version).

response from the server. The change in this PR handles that case and responds to the client with a `transactionNotSupported()` exception.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would want the client to fail at `tx.begin()` but this would involve a much bigger change on the server and across the GLVs.

Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/compare/v4.10.0...4.10.1\">https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/compare/v4.10.0...4.10.1</a></p>\n<h2>4.10 Major feature, code clean up, and bug fix release</h2>\n<h1>ANTLR version 4.10</h1>\n<p>This is a very major release with a number of important changes. There have been many valuable contributions, but I welcome <a href=\"https://github.com/KvanTTT\"><code>@​KvanTTT</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jcking\"><code>@​jcking</code></a> as recent &quot;official&quot; major ANTLR contributors. :)</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>:  <em>Generated 4.10 lexers and parsers are incompatible with code generated by previous versions of ANTLR. You must regenerate all of your code from grammars to use the new runtime. This is true of all targets (except probably javascript).</em></p>\n<h2>Repo branching structure</h2>\n<p>We have changed the branching structure of the repository. The default branch for this repo remains <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master\"><code>master</code></a> and it is the latest stable release with tags for the various releases; e.g., see release tag <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/4.9.3\">4.9.3</a>.  We now do development work in branch <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/dev\"><code>dev</code></a> between releases and all pull requests should be derived from that branch. The <code>dev</code> branch is merged back into <code>master</code> to cut a release and the release state is tagged (e.g., with <code>4.10-rc.1</code> or <code>4.10</code>.) Visually our process looks roughly like this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Targets such as Go that pull directly from the repository can use the default <code>master</code> branch but can also pull from the active <code>dev</code> branch:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr@dev\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Developers certificate of origin</h2>\n<p>In order to bring ANTLR more in line with current standard standards for contribution processes, as of 4.10, ANTLR uses the <a href=\"https://developercertificate.org/\">Linux Foundation's Developer Certificate of Origin, DCO, version 1.1</a>. See file <a href=\"developer-cert-of-origin.txt\">https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/developer-cert-of-origin.txt </a>. It is simpler than the original contributors license agreement, which required programmers to sign the <code>contributors.txt</code> file, which has now moved to file <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/historical-contributors-agreement.txt\">historical-contributors-agreement.txt </a>.</p>\n<p>Each commit in pull requests must have a &quot;signature&quot;, which is simple as using <code>-s</code> (not <code>-S</code>) on the git commit command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Github's pull request process enforces the sig and gives instructions on how to fix any commits that lack the sig. See <a href=\"https://github.com/apps/dco\">https://github.com/apps/dco</a> for more info.</p>\n<h2>4.10-generated parsers incompatible with previous runtimes</h2>\n<p>ANTLR not only generates recursive-descent parsers; it generates a state machine called an augmented transition network (ATN) in serialized form as a bunch of integers stored in the generated parser and lexer files. This serialization format was changed for 4.10 to remove a size limit on the supported ATNs.

There have been many valuable contributions, but I welcome <a href=\"https://github.com/KvanTTT\"><code>@​KvanTTT</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jcking\"><code>@​jcking</code></a> as recent &quot;official&quot; major ANTLR contributors. :)</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>:  <em>Generated 4.10 lexers and parsers are incompatible with code generated by previous versions of ANTLR. You must regenerate all of your code from grammars to use the new runtime. This is true of all targets (except probably javascript).</em></p>\n<h2>Repo branching structure</h2>\n<p>We have changed the branching structure of the repository. The default branch for this repo remains <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/master\"><code>master</code></a> and it is the latest stable release with tags for the various releases; e.g., see release tag <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/4.9.3\">4.9.3</a>.  We now do development work in branch <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/tree/dev\"><code>dev</code></a> between releases and all pull requests should be derived from that branch. The <code>dev</code> branch is merged back into <code>master</code> to cut a release and the release state is tagged (e.g., with <code>4.10-rc.1</code> or <code>4.10</code>.) Visually our process looks roughly like this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Targets such as Go that pull directly from the repository can use the default <code>master</code> branch but can also pull from the active <code>dev</code> branch:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr@dev\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Developers certificate of origin</h2>\n<p>In order to bring ANTLR more in line with current standard standards for contribution processes, as of 4.10, ANTLR uses the <a href=\"https://developercertificate.org/\">Linux Foundation's Developer Certificate of Origin, DCO, version 1.1</a>. See file <a href=\"developer-cert-of-origin.txt\">https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/developer-cert-of-origin.txt </a>. It is simpler than the original contributors license agreement, which required programmers to sign the <code>contributors.txt</code> file, which has now moved to file <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/historical-contributors-agreement.txt\">historical-contributors-agreement.txt </a>.</p>\n<p>Each commit in pull requests must have a &quot;signature&quot;, which is simple as using <code>-s</code> (not <code>-S</code>) on the git commit command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Github's pull request process enforces the sig and gives instructions on how to fix any commits that lack the sig. See <a href=\"https://github.com/apps/dco\">https://github.com/apps/dco</a> for more info.</p>\n<h2>4.10-generated parsers incompatible with previous runtimes</h2>\n<p>ANTLR not only generates recursive-descent parsers; it generates a state machine called an augmented transition network (ATN) in serialized form as a bunch of integers stored in the generated parser and lexer files. This serialization format was changed for 4.10 to remove a size limit on the supported ATNs. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/3591\">antlr/antlr4#3591</a>.</p>\n<p>The key point here is that we changed the version number stored inside the serialization format and so, in order to use this new version of ANTLR, you must regenerate all of your lexers and parsers using the 4.10 tool and then use the new runtime. Parsers generated with 4.10 or not compatible with previous versions of the runtime.</p>\n<h2>Increasing minimum java version</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

issue that triggered this change is that per-request options were not working with gremlin-go. For instance setting a per-request timeout this way:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tresult, err := g.With(\"evaluationTimeout\", 5000).V().Count().Next()\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t// Handle error.\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA very similar problem was described some time ago for the Python GLV in the JIRA issue [TINKERPOP-2296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2296) and solved in the pull-request [apache/tinkerpop#1329](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1329).\r\n\r\nStephen Mallette explains the root cause of the issue in a comment in JIRA:\r\n\r\n> There is no real strategy application in GLVs - the strategies are simply shipped to the server as bytecode configurations. By that point, it's already bypassed the point where the server will care about the timeout (or other request setting) overrides.\r\n\r\nThe Python GLV fixes this issue by:\r\n\r\n1. Converting the \"with\" options into an OptionsStrategy.\r\n2. Extracting a whitelisted set of options from the OptionsStrategy.\r\n3. Sending the extracted options as part of the bytecode request.\r\n\r\nHowever, this means that the generated bytecode will not always match the code written by the users. E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\twith(k, v) -> withStrategies(OptionsStrategy({k: v}))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, this PR takes a slightly different approach. It extracts the whitelisted set of per-request options in makeBytecodeRequests() and adds them to the bytecode request without modifying the generated bytecode.","created_at":"2022-06-13T20:52:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T21:48:36Z","closed_at":"2022-06-24T18:56:38Z","merged_at":"2022-06-24T18:56:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"71f3ee0ab2fec3322b3a896222ad0ccbd6c0919c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4030743651,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAdCfSc7wQERj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/labels/go","name":"go","color":"2626B7","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/30f9702b189bfd7f3fb49c8cf36b62b1ea25f7e1","head":{"label":"jroimartin:extract-req-args","ref":"extract-req-args","sha":"30f9702b189bfd7f3fb49c8cf36b62b1ea25f7e1","user":{"login":"jroimartin","id":1223476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM0NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin","html_url":"https://github.com/jroimartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":502992183,"node_id":"R_kgDOHfsNNw","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"jroimartin/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jroimartin","id":1223476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM0NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin","html_url":"https://github.com/jroimartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroimartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jroimartin/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

PR fixed:\r\n`traversal.getGraph()` is empty in `StepStrategy.apply()` method `VertexStepStrategy.apply(Traversal.Admin traversal)` for the following Gremlin:\r\n```java\r\ng.V(3).repeat(inE('child').outV().simplePath())\r\n .until(or(inE().count().is(0),loops().is(eq(2))))\r\n .path()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Initial data:\r\n```\r\ng.addV('node').property(id, 1).as('1')\r\n .addV('node').property(id, 2).as('2')\r\n .addV('node').property(id, 3).as('3')\r\n .addV('node').property(id, 4).as('4')\r\n .addE('child').from('1').to('2')\r\n .addE('child').from('2').to('3')\r\n .addE('child').from('4').to('3')\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cause analysis:\r\nIn the case of a non `count().is(0)` statement, the graph context is passed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/f8af06198ee5d112599fb938f97ff9707a83c81c/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/util/DefaultTraversal.java#L138\r\n\r\nSo we can get the graph context when Strategy.apply() is called:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/f8af06198ee5d112599fb938f97ff9707a83c81c/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/util/DefaultTraversal.java#L152\r\n\r\nBut when using the `count().is(0)` statement, the graph context is missing because the original traversal is replaced with a new traversal by `__.start()`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/7f7d3a485c7f100f98047b71672a0c2c9ab855b4/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/strategy/optimization/CountStrategy.java#L154\r\n\r\nThe

to Issue: [TINKERPOP-2749](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2749)\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses Errors that cause the Windows build of Gremlin Dotnet to fail.\r\n\r\nIssues Addressed:\r\n1. Fixed an issue where groovy script defined in `gremlin-dotnet/src/pom.xml` receives an incorrectly formatted path for Windows. Single `\\` characters are invalid in groovy and using `${project.basedir}` returns a string with non-escaped `\\` characters in Windows.\r\n\r\n_Note: The .NET windows build workflow has not yet been activated as there were inconsistent failures popping up on GitHub actions. Around 1-2 out of 10 workflow runs would fail due to inconsistent test failures. This issue needs to be more thoroughly investigated. Locally, however, the build has no issues on Windows with these changes._\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under

suggested in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2708, deprecated and removed the functionality of the connection option `connectOnStartup`. Since it is generally not good to return promises in constructors, removing the call to `open()` in the `Connection` constructor seemed to be the way to resolve unhandledRejection and any potential race conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight API behaviour change as a result. Setting `connectOnStartup` true now will log a deprecated warning to the user. The `Connection` constructor will no longer initiate connection in the background by default, so users will need to call `open()` explicitly after creating a connection object. However, `open()` is called anyways when connection submits traversals, removing this from the constructor shouldn't affect any normal traversal functionality. \r\n\r\nAs this may be considered a breaking change, I added a change-log entry, are there additional docs I should edit? \r\n\r\nAs a side note, this is related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2381. I believe removing connectOnStartup functionality resolves the issues listed. I'm not sure if there is a need to refactor how Client invokes `connection.open()`, since inside `connection.open()`, it does check if it has been called previously.

Tinkerpop does not build on Windows. Running `mvn clean install` causes errors in `gremlin-javascript` and other modules.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the errors caused by `gremlin-javascript`. It also adds a Windows build check to the GitHub Actions workflows.\r\n\r\nIssues addressed:\r\n1. Fixed an issue where groovy script defined in `gremlin-javascript/pom.xml` receives an incorrectly formatted path for Windows. Single `\\` characters are invalid in groovy and using `${project.basedir}` returns a string with non-escaped `\\` characters.\r\n2. Fixed an issue where lint/line-break checks would fail with message: `Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF'`\r\n3. Fixed an issue where relative addressing is used, which was causing `'.' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` errors.\r\n4. Fixed an issue where incorrectly formatted paths taken from `pom.xml` properties would lead to `test-server-start.groovy` initializing integration test server incorrectly on Windows.\r\n\r\nLink to

test `shouldSerializeToTreeJson()`, which is found in various test classes, is non deterministic. It is non-deterministic because it relies on a specific order in which the iterator will iterate on `firstTree`, which is a `HashMap` containing 3 elements - `\"vadas\", \"lop\", and \"josh\"`. The iteration order on a `HashMap` is not guaranteed by Java to be the same each time we iterate on it. This can cause the tests to non-deterministically fail sometimes.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the test more robust by relaxing the ordering requirement on the elements within `firstTree`. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-15T06:46:16Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T10:33:42Z","closed_at":"2022-06-15T10:33:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e3ab8d1293aaad1cb2af5949c54a9b26932db3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/cb6b6f61a483c732ced9ee3a0194c4fa576b5f7e","head":{"label":"chessvivek:fix-flaky","ref":"fix-flaky","sha":"cb6b6f61a483c732ced9ee3a0194c4fa576b5f7e","user":{"login":"chessvivek","id":42974953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTc0OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42974953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek","html_url":"https://github.com/chessvivek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":492138174,"node_id":"R_kgDOHVVuvg","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"chessvivek/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chessvivek","id":42974953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTc0OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42974953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek","html_url":"https://github.com/chessvivek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chessvivek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chessvivek/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

Graph::getCardinality only takes a vertex property key as the parameter,\r\nwhich sometimes is limited for the graph provider to make a proper choice\r\nabout the cardinality of the vertex property. This commit overloads this method\r\nwhich takes both the property key and values as parameters so that the graph\r\nprovider can hopefully make a better choice. For example, a graph provider can\r\nuse list/set cardinality when it sees multiple values and uses single\r\ncardinality when it only sees one value. This is particularly useful when loading\r\na graph using the IO step without a pre-defined schema.","created_at":"2022-05-14T22:20:56Z","updated_at":"2022-06-20T18:24:12Z","closed_at":"2022-06-20T18:24:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08d1b202e1046440eadf158348d319609dc5bf76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/dc69004ab02dc755097c970ce6f9480d6c683e9e","head":{"label":"li-boxuan:tinkerpop-2742","ref":"tinkerpop-2742","sha":"dc69004ab02dc755097c970ce6f9480d6c683e9e","user":{"login":"li-boxuan","id":25746010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzQ2MDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan","html_url":"https://github.com/li-boxuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":389518957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODk1MTg5NTc=","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"li-boxuan/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"li-boxuan","id":25746010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzQ2MDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25746010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan","html_url":"https://github.com/li-boxuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-boxuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/li-boxuan/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

the <code>Throwables</code> methods <code>lazyStackTrace</code> and <code>lazyStackTraceIsLazy</code>. They are no longer useful on any current platform. (6ebd7d8648)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added a new method <code>ImmutableMap.Builder.buildKeepingLast()</code>, which keeps the last value for any given key rather than throwing an exception when a key appears more than once. (68500b2c09)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: As a side-effect of the <code>buildKeepingLast()</code> change, the idiom <code>ImmutableList.copyOf(Maps.transformValues(map, function))</code> may produce different results if <code>function</code> has side-effects. (This is not recommended.) (68500b2c09)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Added <code>Hashing.fingerprint2011()</code>. (13f703c25f)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteStreams.nullOutputStream()</code> to follow the contract of <code>OutputStream.write</code> by throwing an exception if the range of bytes is out of bounds. (1cd85d01c9)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>@CheckReturnValue</code> to the package (with a few exceptions). (a0e2577de6)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constant for <code>Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network</code>. (6dabbdf9c9)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added accumulate/update methods for <code>AtomicDouble</code> and <code>AtomicDoubleArray</code>. (2d875d327a)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>APIs promoted from <code>@Beta</code></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>base</code>: <code>Throwables</code> methods <code>getCausalChain</code> and <code>getCauseAs</code> (dd462afa6b)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: <code>Streams</code> methods <code>mapWithIndex</code> and <code>findLast</code> (8079a29463)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: the remaining methods in <code>Comparators</code>: <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>lexicographical</code>, <code>emptiesFirst</code>, <code>emptiesLast</code>, <code>isInOrder</code>, <code>isInStrictOrder</code> (a3e411c3a4)</li>\n<li><code>escape</code>: various APIs (468c68a6ac)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
