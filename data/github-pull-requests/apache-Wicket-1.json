PR attempts to address most of the deprecated call warnings shown during compilation time. There are a still couple of them left that are a bit more tricky to handle:\r\n* DebugSettings#isOutputMarkupContainerClassName usage in Page - the output strategy is not simple to implement given that Page currently only embeds the classname as a separate comment element, not sure what it should tie to otherwise\r\n* Cookie#setComment, #setVersion usages - don't think anything really needs to be done about these\r\n* CachingResourceStreamLocator#locate - there is a missing @Deprecated annotation. Without proper JavaDoc explanation I didn't want to go down a road for this one\r\n* AccessController usages in JavaSerializer - could just replace them with Runnable#run I suppose, but wasn't sure whether security manager support was there for something
