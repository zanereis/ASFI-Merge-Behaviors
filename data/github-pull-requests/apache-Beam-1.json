Description  \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we mainly replace `reflect.DeepEqual` with the `cmp` package for comparisons in Go test files (`*_test.go`). The `cmp` package provides a more powerful and safer alternative for value equality checks.  \r\n\r\nCloses #20154.  \r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context  \r\n\r\nAs stated in the upstream issue and the [cmp documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp):  \r\n\r\n> _Package cmp determines equality of values._  \r\n> _This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to reflect.DeepEqual for comparing whether two values are semantically equal._  \r\n\r\nThe upsteram issue specifically mentioned [`fullvalue_test.go`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/runtime/exec/fullvalue_test.go). However, I think this improvement can be extended to other test files as well.  \r\n\r\nTo facilitate review, this PR includes two commits:  \r\n1. The first commit updates `fullvalue_test.go`.  \r\n2. The second commit updates the remaining test files.  \r\n\r\nThis separation allows for easier discussion and review of changes in case we decide to extend it to other test files.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this dry run will just not execute because of permissions issues. Unfortunately, permissions issues are 403s, and quota issues are also 403s so its tough to differentiate.\r\n\r\nSince the dry run isn't necessary for the job to complete, but does block the job from starting, this reduces the total number of retries. Given the starting backoff of 1s, this should at most backoff: `1s+2s+4s+8s+16s = 31s`, which should be fine.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Effectively makes all aggregation transforms (AKA, GBKs) stateful.\r\n* Adds all non-processing time derived triggers.\r\n* Adds support for Accumulation mode.\r\n* Adds computation of panes for the triggered aggregation results.\r\n* Handles trigger edge case WRT Lifted combines and ElementCount triggers by disabling lifting when one is detected.\r\n* Added some of the Go trigger tests to the engine_test.go file, to maintain coverage.\r\n  * Note, the Go trigger tests are *not* canonical as the Go SDK has issues regarding panes, largely due to not having any runner that would support testing them. (see #31153)(until prism). \r\n\r\nImportant notes: Does not support processing time triggers, or triggered side inputs or triggers against merging windows at this PR. Those will be supported at a later PR. \r\n\r\nBlocks submission of Processing Time triggers at this time.\r\nTODO doesn't currently do the analysis for blocking Triggered Side Inputs, and triggers for merging windows.\r\n\r\nIncreases the number of Java Validates Runner tests that pass from 325 to 336.\r\n\r\nPart of #31438. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

implementing Triggers + Panes for Prism, I ran into inexplicable failing tests.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that portable encoding of panes in the protos *does not* match the implementations in the Python, and Java SDKs, or the internal Dataflow implementation, and never has in the 5 years since it was added to the protocol buffers.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the bits for first and last panes are swapped with first being the 7 indexed bit, and last being the 6 indexed bit.\r\n\r\nCompare Python and Java\r\n https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/windowed_value.py#L92\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/windowing/PaneInfo.java#L134\r\n\r\nTo Go's current implementation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.62.0/sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/graph/coder/panes.go#L32\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Go implemenation didn't have the swap some years ago when it was first added in https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/b0e9f2638cbaca822ee6a58bd8ec0e61db8e799e but it wasn't unit tested at the time.\r\n\r\nBut due to a different error in the implementation, the bit swap occurred in https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/657caa88c011cae818377f64f02afe9d18614da5 where it was made to match the spec in the protocol buffers on top of fixing the other error.\r\n\r\nThis error wasn't caught until now due to Triggers (and thus Panes) being among the last features implemented in the SDK, and the least tested due to no real portable implementations of TestStream necessary to exercise them. The Go SDK doesn't currently provide facilities to assert against specific pane properties, and it is unlikely for there to be user code for this since it seems like the Go SDK also doesn't propagate panes properly.

isn't a cure-all for everything. It won't remove tasks in a highly-duplicated graph, like the one we collect in the DaskRunner's visitor. The fix, however, is quite simple: We can get away with the dask distributed client only running the last value in the translated operation graph.\r\n\r\nEven with this small change, all tests pass. Further, it should lead to a significant performance improvement.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
