few extra checks and tests to verify that a blocking Connector or Task will not prevent Workers from properly stopping and cleaning up Tasks. Previously, tests existed to verify that Tasks were stopped, but not cleaned up.\r\n\r\nA new check and assertion is added to EmbeddedConnectClusterAssertions to enable these tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, an extra pause is added to the blocking `poll()` in these tests, because I observed `poll()` being called in a tight loop during some tests.\r\n\r\nExtra context:\r\n\r\nIn a previous PR (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10605) I was confused by `WorkerTask.stop()` vs `Task.stop()`. My reading of the code was that `Task.stop()` was called sequentially, but in fact `WorkerTask.stop()` merely triggers the asynchronous invocation of `Task.stop()`. During my investigation of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12726 I wrote tests to validate that the problem I observed in production was already fixed. This PR includes these extra tests.","created_at":"2021-05-03T19:07:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T03:42:32Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T03:42:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

laid out in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12605 kafka consumers decoding gzip'ed payloads currently do not re-use memory buffers because the JDK classes used have no support for it.\r\n\r\nthis PR adds buffer reuse support to gzip decoding.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, since the JDK classes involved are not properly extensible I've had to make copies of them. modification to these copies are kept minimal:\r\n\r\n1. buffers now come from, and are returned to, suppliers\r\n2. some use of Unsafe has been replaced with more portable code\r\n3. minor changes required to comply with kafka's checkstyle\r\n4. KafkaBufferedInputStream does not fully support the mark() operation as that may involve buffer re-allocation. I have not found any usage of mark() in kafka code though.\r\n\r\nso far only decompression is supported. compression may be added later.\r\n\r\na (randomized) test has been added that I have run on my machine for several hours with no issues.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build

patch adds `Admin` support for the `listTransactions` API, which was added by [KIP-664](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-664%3A+Provide+tooling+to+detect+and+abort+hanging+transactions). Similar to `listConsumerGroups`, the new `listTransactions` API is intended to be sent to all brokers. This did not fit very well with the new `AdminApiDriver` that was used for the other KIP-664 APIs, so I had to refactor a bit. The way I ultimately handled it is to treat the brokerId as the key that needs to be mapped. Unlike with the other cases, the set of brokerIds is not known ahead of time and has to be discovered through a `Metadata` lookup (just as with `listConsumerGroups`). Because the future associated with `ListTransactionsResult` is more complex, I ended up externalizing future completion in a new `AdminApiFuture` object which is passed to `AdminApiDriver` during construction.\r\n\r\nOne minor change that is also worth calling out is the removal of `AdminApiHandler.Keys`. This was previously used to indicate the sets of statically and dynamically mapped keys. Instead, I now handle this with a new `StaticBrokerStrategy`. The static scope is indicated by returning an `ApiRequestScope` object which has a specific destination broker set.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

Java 9 onwards, `LoginContext#logout()` throws an NPE if invoked multiple times due to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8173069. KerberosLogin currently attempts logout followed by login in a background refresh thread. If login fails we retry the same sequence. As a result, a single login failure prevents subsequent re-login. And clients will never be able to authenticate successfully after the first failure, until the process is restarted.\r\n\r\nThe PR checks if logout is necessary before invoking LoginContext#logout(). Also adds a test for this case.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

followup to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10342 that I noticed while working on the NamedTopology stuff. Cleans up a few things:\r\n\r\n1. We no longer need locking for the global state directory either, since it's contained within the top-level state directory lock. Definitely less critical than the task directory locking, since it's less vulnerable to IOExceptions given that it's just locked and unlocked once during the application lifetime, but nice to have nonetheless\r\n2. Clears out misc. usages of the LOCK_FILE_NAME that no longer apply.

misbehaving Task.stop() can prevent other Tasks from stopping, even when a graceful shutdown timeout is configured. We improve the situation as follows:\r\n\r\n- prior to task.shutdown.graceful.timeout.ms expiring, the existing behavior is retained, except that Task.stop() is called in a new Thread.\r\n- after task.shutdown.graceful.timeout.ms expires, the Worker runs any remaining Task.stop()s concurrently.\r\n\r\nThus, the behavior doesn't change appreciably when Tasks behave normally; however, if any Task.stop() get stuck (e.g. in a retry loop) we continue with a best-effort

Added default RLMM implementation based on internal topic storage.\r\n- This is the initial version of the default RLMM implementation. \r\n- This includes changes containing default RLMM configs, RLMM implementation, producer/consumer managers.\r\n- Introduced `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManagerHarness` which takes care of bringing up a Kafka cluster and create remote log metadata topic and initializes `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager`.\r\n- Refactored existing `RemoteLogMetadataCacheTest` to `RemoteLogSegmentLifecycleTest` to have parameterized tests to run both `RemoteLogMetadataCache` and also `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager`.\r\n- Refactored existing `InmemoryRemoteLogMetadataManagerTest`,  `RemoteLogMetadataManagerTest` to have parameterized tests to run both `InmemoryRemoteLogMetadataManager` and also `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager`.\r\n\r\nWe will have a followup PR adding file based cache for storing the remote log state for each partition to avoid consuming from the remote log metadata topic from the earliest whenever a broker is restarted.\r\n\r\nThis is part of tiered storage KIP-405 efforts.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

haven't yet found the time to implement spill-to-disk for the suppression buffer, so we should remove the  `SPILL_TO_DISK` enum to avoid confusion. Technically this enum is in an internal package, and a user would have to be invoking the `StrictBufferConfigImpl` constructor (which is also internal) to have reason to access this enum at all. But users don't always know/notice/care that APIs are internal, or they may just be browsing the source code, so we may as well remove this source of confusion. It's always kind of confusing to see this as a dev.\r\n\r\nAt the moment if a user does choose this strategy, an UnsupportedOperationException claiming that this is a bug will be thrown when the buffer is full, so it's not like anything too bad would happen...it's just

the `WorkerSinkTask`'s consumer rebalance listener (and related logic) is hardcoded to assume eager rebalancing, which means that all partitions are revoked any time a rebalance occurs and then the set of partitions included in `onPartitionsAssigned` is assumed to be the complete assignment for the task. Not only does this cause failures when the cooperative consumer protocol is used, it fails to take advantage of the benefits provided by that protocol.\r\n\r\nThese changes alter framework logic to not only not break when the cooperative consumer protocol is used for a sink connector, but to reap the benefits of it as well, by not revoking partitions unnecessarily from tasks just to reopen them immediately after the rebalance has completed.\r\n\r\nThis change will be necessary in order to support [KIP-726](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=177048248), which currently proposes that the default consumer partition assignor be changed to the `CooperativeStickyAssignor`.\r\n\r\nTwo integration tests are added to verify sink task behavior with both eager and

from the JIRA:\r\n\r\n> In Partition.scala, there is a race condition between the handling of an AlterIsrResponse and a LeaderAndIsrRequest. This is a pretty rare scenario and would involve the AlterIsrResponse being delayed for some time, but it is possible. This was observed in a test environment when lots of ISR and leadership changes were happening due to broker restarts.\r\n> \r\n> When the leader handles the LeaderAndIsr, it calls Partition#makeLeader which overrides the isrState variable and clears the pending ISR items via AlterIsrManager#clearPending(TopicPartition).\r\n> \r\n> The bug is that AlterIsrManager does not check its inflight state before clearing pending items. The way AlterIsrManager is designed, it retains inflight items in the pending items collection until the response is processed (to allow for retries). The result is that an inflight item is inadvertently removed from this collection.\r\n> \r\n> Since the inflight item is cleared from the collection, AlterIsrManager allows for new AlterIsrItem-s to be enqueued for this partition even though it has an inflight AlterIsrItem. By allowing an update to be enqueued, Partition will transition its isrState to one of the inflight states (PendingIsrExpand, PendingIsrShrink, etc). Once the inflight partition's response is handled, it will fail to update the isrState due to detecting changes since the request was sent (which is by design). However, after the response callback is run, AlterIsrManager will clear the partitions that it saw in the response from the unsent items collection. This includes the newly added (and unsent) update.\r\n> \r\n> The result is that Partition has a \"inflight\" isrState but AlterIsrManager does not have an unsent item for this partition. This prevents any further ISR updates on the partition until the next leader election (when isrState is reset).\r\n> \r\n> If this bug is encountered, the workaround is to force a leader election which will reset the partition's state.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the clearPending call from AlterIsrManager. As seen with this bug, this method is not safe to call any time there is an AlterIsrRequest in-flight. We could add more protections around this call, but it is simpler (and safer) to just remove it. Clearing unsent ISR updates is not really necessary after a leader election since the updates will fail due to a stale leader epoch.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-19T15:03:23Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T13:56:37Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T13:56:37Z","merged_at":"2021-05-18T13:56:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"aefe0e4d8cba8585f74fb7c50761951e663bd8ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/46c0324acf29afefda0bebb9618c7286fd3a61a2","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-12686-alter-isr-race","ref":"KAFKA-12686-alter-isr-race","sha":"46c0324acf29afefda0bebb9618c7286fd3a61a2","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch adds support for running the ZooKeeper-based `kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer` with KRaft clusters.  Set the `authorizer.class.name` config as well as the `zookeeper.connect` config while also setting the typical KRaft configs (`node.id`, `process.roles`, etc.), and the cluster will use KRaft for metadata and ZooKeeper for ACL storage.  A system test that exercises the authorizer is included.\r\n\r\nThis patch also changes \"Raft\" to \"KRaft\" in several system test files.  It also fixes a bug where system test admin clients were unable to connect to a cluster with broker credentials via the SSL security protocol when the broker was using that for inter-broker communication and SASL for client communication.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build
