are evaluated each time we parse a dag because it's done in a separate process, so the modules cache is not shared (and is lost when the process is destroyed after having parsed the dag).\r\nImporting user dependencies in a separate process is good because it provides isolation, but airflow dependencies are something we can pre-import to gain time.\r\nBy doing it before we fork, we only have to do it once, it's then in the cache of all child processes.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing this code where I read the python file, extract the imports that concern airflow modules, and I import the result using importlib in the processor, just before we span the process that's going to execute the dag file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nFor simple dags that just define a couple operators and plug them together, this showed a ~60% reduction on the time it takes to process a dag file, from around 300ms to around 100ms on my machine.\r\n\r\nRunning it on a bunch of the example dags we have, I get the following (more diverse) numbers:\r\n<img width=\"466\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114772123/231273210-f8dab94f-4293-4930-be94-d34caf61d84d.png\">\r\nmethod: ran airflow in breeze on my machine, the times from main are an average of 11 parsing passes, the times for this code are an average of 25 parsing passes. I used the number that is sent for the `dag_processing.last_duration.{file_name}` metric.\r\n`__init__` is the file that's in `tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/utils/__init__.py`, required for aws example dags to work properly. It doesn't contain dags, but still passes the heuristic (which is good in this case otherwise it'd hide some imports).\r\n\r\nWhy some files get more boost than others, I don't really know. It can be that they do a lot in top-level code, so the imports are relatively smaller in comparison (this is the case for example_s3 and example_sagemaker, which show a good absolute improvement, but not so much in %). It can be that the operators they import didn't pull that many dependencies, so they weren't putting too much drag (probably the case for example_http ?). Or maybe other reasons.\r\nThe good news is that this shows improvements all across the board

logs everything into Error stream, which is probably sufficient for most use-cases.\r\nIt might be more intuitive and more desired to have errors/criticals go to stderr, while low severity informations like info/warning go to stdout.\r\n\r\nI have tested this solution, which I propose here with worker producing various severity levels of logs and they are correctly split into out and error streams.\r\n\r\nI provided a solution which is backward compatible, so anyone that does not want to use it can just ignore it. \r\n\r\nDuring pre-commit I discovered that config.yml needs to be updated and I am not sure how to perform that correctly.\r\nWe need to adjust config.yml for this to be complete, I wasn't sure if this should be made by hand or via some

This feature is designed to provide a more efficient way to adjust the status of multiple tasks at once, especially for complex workflows with large numbers of tasks.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary use cases for this feature is when certain tasks in a task group have failed due to unexpected issues. Instead of manually setting the status of each failed task to \"failed\", users can mark the entire task group as \"failed\", and the system will automatically propagate this status to all tasks within the group. Similarly, in the case of a manual DAG run triggered through the UI or the API, where certain tasks or sensors may not matter for that run, users can easily mark the entire task group as \"success\" to avoid having to set each task individually.\r\n\r\nI have tested this feature. Please let me know if there are any further changes or improvements that you would like me to make before merging this pull request.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and

of the steps in our CI is to collect tests, which is to prevent parallel tests from even starting when we know test collection will fail (it is terrible waste of resources to start 20 test jobs and initialize databases etc. when we know it is not needed.\r\n\r\nThis however introduced a single point of delay in the CI process, which with the recent collection protection implemented in #30315 piled up to more than 5 minutes occassionally on the CI machines of ours, especially on public runners.\r\n\r\nThis PR utilises our existing test framework to be able to parallelise test collection (Pytest does not have paralllel collection mechanism) - also for localised PRs it will only run test collection for the test types that are going to be executed, which will speed it up quite a lot.\r\n\r\nThis might get further sped up if we split Provider tests into smaller groups to parallelise them even more.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

we had a number of flaky failures for cli connection add test. The problem is that those tests initialize providers manager which loads all available hooks and imports their dependencies.

#30400\r\n\r\n---\r\nAccording to kubernetes python client documentation:\r\n```\r\nNote that watching an API resource can expire. The method tries to\r\nresume automatically once from the last result, but if that last result\r\nis too old as well, an `ApiException` exception will be thrown with\r\n``code`` 410. In that case you have to recover yourself, probably\r\nby listing the API resource to obtain the latest state and then\r\nwatching from that state on by setting ``resource_version`` to\r\none returned

--test-type and --test-types parameters were very similar, but they have enough difference to differentiate them even more:\r\n\r\nThe --test-type is specifically to run single test and it might include not only the regular \"test-types\" but also allow for cross-selection of tests from different other types (for example --test-type Postgres will run tests for Postgres database and they might come from Providers, Others, CLI etc.\r\n\r\nWhere --test-types was generally foreseen to be able to split the tests into \"sepearated\" groups that could be run in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe parameters have different defaults and even different choice of test type that you could choose from (and --test-types is a space-separated one to make it easier to pass it around in CI, where rather than passing multiple (variable number) of parameters, it's easier to pass a single, even space-separated list of tests to run.\r\n\r\nThis change is good to show the difference between then parameters and to stress that they are really quite different, also it makes it easier to avoid confusion people might have especially that the name was easy to have typo in.\r\n\r\nIn a way (but different than in

agreed in https://lists.apache.org/thread/g8b3k028qhzgw6c3yz4jvmlc67kcr9hj we introduce mechanism to suspend providers from our suite of providers when they are holding us back to older version of dependencies.\r\n\r\nProvider's suspension is controlled from a single `suspend` flag in `provider.yaml` - this flag is used to generate\r\nproviders_dependencies.json in generated folders (provider is skipped if it has `suspended` flag set to `true`. This is enough to exclude provider from the extras of airflow and (automatically) from being used when CI image is build and constraints are being generated, as well as from provider documentation/generation.\r\n\r\nAlso several parts of the CI build use the flag to filter out such suspended provider from:\r\n\r\n* verification of provider.yaml files in pre-commit is skipped in terms of importing and checking if classes are defined and listed in the provider.yaml\r\n* the \"tests\" folders for providers are skipped automatically if the provider has \"suspend\" = true set\r\n* in case of PR that is aimed to modify suspended providers directory tree (when it is not a global provider refactor) selective checks will detect it and fail such PR with appropriate message suggesting to fix the reason for suspention first\r\n* documentation build is skipped for suspended providers\r\n* mypy static checks will skip suspended provider folders while we will still run ruff checks on them (unlike mypy ruff does not expect the libraries that it imports to be available and we are running ruff in a separate environment where no airflow dependencies are installed anyway\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

agreed in https://lists.apache.org/thread/g8b3k028qhzgw6c3yz4jvmlc67kcr9hj we introduce mechanism to suspend providers from our suite of providers when they are holding us back to older version of dependencies.\r\n\r\nProvider's suspension is controlled from a single `suspend` flag in `provider.yaml` - this flag is used to generate\r\nproviders_dependencies.json in generated folders (provider is skipped if it has `suspended` flag set to `true`. This is enough to exclude provider from the extras of airflow and (automatically) from being used when CI image is build and constraints are being generated, as well as from provider documentation/generation.\r\n\r\nAlso several parts of the CI build use the flag to filter out such suspended provider from:\r\n\r\n* verification of provider.yaml files in pre-commit is skipped in terms of importing and checking if classes are defined and listed in the provider.yaml\r\n* the \"tests\" folders for providers are skipped automatically if the provider has \"suspend\" = true set\r\n* in case of PR that is aimed to modify suspended providers directory tree (when it is not a global provider refactor) selective checks will detect it and fail such PR with appropriate message suggesting to fix the reason for suspention first\r\n* documentation build is skipped for suspended providers\r\n* mypy static checks will skip suspended provider folders while we will still run ruff checks on them (unlike mypy ruff does not expect the libraries that it imports to be available and we are running ruff in a separate environment where no airflow dependencies are installed anyway\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

action was disable in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20659 which resolved https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/20655. The issue only mentions that the edit is broken and should be disabled. So it seem like the disabling of the clear action was unintentional.\r\n\r\nAlso based on the discussion in the PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/20655 further reinforces this. That the author believed it still worked could be explain by that using a user with role `Admin` the action was still available and therefore one could easily make a mistake believing it still worked as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR reenables it action and modifies and existing test case to also verify that clearing is possible using a user with the role `User`.\r\n\r\nThis closes

a bug in the `TriggerDagRunOperator` when operating where `deferrable=True`. \r\n\r\nThe cause of the bug was a misunderstanding in which execution date was being brought through with the context + a bad mocked value in the original tests. \r\n\r\nThe suggested remedy (here) is to have the Trigger instance return a serialized version of itself and then use that to validate the exit status of the external dag. \r\n\r\nFunctional test below\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-31

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nWhile debugging an issue on why our DAGs were running without tasks (issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/18880), I found a possible \"race condition\" in `DagBag.get_dag`.\r\n\r\nSince DAGs are serialized and written to database in a different process than the scheduler, it's possible to end up in a situation where the serialized DAG `last_updated` field is before the DagBag `last_fetched` datetime, while the cached version in the DagBag is not the latest one. Once this situation is reached, the only was to refresh the DAG is either to modify it, or to restart the scheduler.\r\n\r\nThe diagram below should help to illustrate the problem:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    DagProcessor->>DagProcessor: Parse and collect DAGs\r\n    activate DagProcessor\r\n    Note left of DagProcessor: Begin Transaction\r\n    DagProcessor->>DagProcessor: Serialize DAG A (last_updated = 10:00:00)\r\n    DagProcessor->>DagProcessor: serialize DAG B (last_updated = 10:00:01)\r\n    DagProcessor->>DagProcessor: serialize DAG C (last_updated = 10:00:02)\r\n    par\r\n        DagProcessor->>DagProcessor: serialize DAG D (last_updated = 10:00:03)\r\n    and\r\n        Scheduler->>Scheduler: read DAG A (last_fetched = 10:00:03)\r\n        Note right of Scheduler: previous version of DAG A was fetched\r\n    end\r\n    DagProcessor->>DagProcessor: serialize DAG E (last_updated = 10:00:04)\r\n    Note left of DagProcessor: End Transaction\r\n    deactivate DagProcessor\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of complex DAGs in a single file, the serialization step can take a long time. If, during this time, the scheduler has to run a DAG currently being serialized, you can have a situation where the `last_fetched` value of the DagBag is after the `last_updated` value of the serialized DAG while still having the previous version of the DAG in memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by also checking the serialized DAG hash in addition to the last updated datetime. I'm wondering if maybe we can just use the hash here instead of the updated datetime, but I'm not sure of the possible side-effects.\r\n\r\nI've added a new unit tests replicating the issue. Without the patch, the test fails.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

is the final step of decoupling of the job runner from ORM\r\nbased BaseJob. After this change, finally we rich the state that\r\nthe BaseJob is just a state of the Job being run, but all\r\nthe logic is kept in separate \"JobRunner\" entity which just\r\nkeeps the reference to the job. Also it makes sure that\r\njob in each runner is defined as appropriate for each job type:\r\n\r\n* SchedulerJobRunner, BackfillJobRunner can only use BaseJob\r\n* DagProcessorJobRunner, TriggererJobRunner and especially the\r\n  LocalTaskJobRunner can keep both BaseJob and it's Pydantic\r\n  BaseJobPydantic representation - for AIP-44 usage.\r\n\r\nThe highlights of this change:\r\n\r\n* Job does not have job_runner reference any more\r\n* Job is a mandatory parameter when creating each JobRunner\r\n* run_job method takes as parameter the job (i.e. where the state\r\n  of the job is called) and executor_callable - i.e. the method\r\n  to run when the job gets executed\r\n* heartbeat callback is also passed a generic callable in order\r\n  to execute the post-heartbeat operation of each of the job\r\n  type\r\n* there is no more need to specify job_type when you create\r\n  BaseJob, the job gets its type by a simply creating a runner\r\n  with the job\r\n* DagFileProcessorManager is now merged into DagProcessorJobRunner.\r\n  The JobRuner was essentially calling the processormanager that\r\n  created processors. In order to make it consistent with other\r\n  Runners - all of it has been moved into runner, so that it\r\n  starts doing \"something\" - similar as other runners - rather than\r\n  creating processor manager and running it.\r\n\r\nThis is the final stage of refactoring that was split into\r\nreviewable stages: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30255 -> https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30302 -> https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30308 -> this PR.\r\n\r\nPlease check only the last commit.\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/30325\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

accidentally closed #30108, so this is basically reopening that PR. Some updates:\r\n\r\n* There's not really a mechanism to deprecate multiple configs into one. The nature of this change requires some unique deprecation logic which is implemented in `scheduler_job.py`.\r\n* This deprecates `celery.stalled_task_timeout`, `kubernetes.worker_pods_pending_timeout`, and `celery.task_adoption_timeout`\r\n\r\ncloses: #28120\r\ncloses: #21225\r\ncloses: #28943\r\n\r\nTasks occasionally get stuck in queued and aren't resolved by `stalled_task_timeout` (#28120). This PR moves the logic for handling stalled tasks to the scheduler and simplifies the logic by marking any task that has been queued for more than `scheduler.task_queued_timeout` as failed, allowing it to be retried if the task has available retries.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't require an additional scheduler nor allow for the possibility of tasks to get stuck in an infinite loop of scheduled -> queued

improvement contains two cases:\r\n\r\n- Update status for ready for scheduling tasks in batches to get rid of the stack depth limit exceeded error when mapped task instances > 4k\r\n- speed up the scheduling of mapped tasks:\r\n    Calling _revise_map_indexes_if_mapped for each task instance was significantly slowing down the scheduling, but it's enough to call the method only once per task id.

Overview\r\nThis PR aims to improve the time it takes to load/import the various executor modules we have in Airflow.\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe executors are imported in more places now that various compatibility checks are in core Airflow code (re: AIP-51). Also, decreasing import times is very important for the work of executors vending CLI commands (see #29055), since the CLI code in Airflow is particularly sensitive to slow imports (because all code is loaded fresh each time you run an individual Airflow CLI command).\r\n### The changes\r\nThis PR mostly includes changes to move some expensive imports that are only used for type checking under the `TYPE_CHECKING` flag so that they are not run at runtime. As well as moving a select few expensive imports closer to the code which uses them.\r\nThe most important changes are in the `BaseExecutor` module since all other executors load this module, and so benefits made here propagate outward.\r\n### Testing\r\nI benchmarked these changes by writing a script to import the various executor modules in a fresh python runtime and timing how long that takes (you can test this yourself quickly from a bash shell by doing something like `time python -c 'from airflow.executors.local_executor import LocalExecutor'`). Then doing that in a loop for several samples (with some randomness in the order for fairness) both on main and on my development branch. \r\n### Results\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-29 12-39-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65743084/228649458-06db2caf-38dd-411b-9760-63c0cff40e12.png)\r\n\r\nMost executors saw a ~50% speed increase. Kubernetes, and to a lesser extent Celery, are still quite slow and will need more changes specifically targeted to those modules (in a future PR).\r\nThe combined executors (e.g. LocalKubernetesExecutor) saw less gains since they import two executors each, so they're paying double the cost (so they saw half the gains, 25%)   \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR closes #26424\r\nProblem Statement: The POST Request to the endpoint  `/api/v1/dags/~/dagRuns/~/taskInstances/list` returns an unhelpful error -> \"detail\": \"None is not of type 'object'\", when the JSON Body is empty. Upon further inspection, it seems that this error is raised by vaildation.py and is not handled properly leading to a generic error message and a Python Exception inside the logs.\r\nFix: Allowing the request payload to be nullable and then checking if the data in the request is None before parsing it into JSON -> allows us to handle this error gracefully and even check for other unhandled cases.\r\n\r\nNew Response: \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"detail\": \"['POST Body must not be None']\",\r\n    \"status\": 400,\r\n    \"title\": \"Bad Request\",\r\n    \"type\":
