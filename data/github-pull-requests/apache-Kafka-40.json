drives the consumer closing via events, and rely on the still-alived network thread to complete these operations.\r\n\r\nThis ticket encompasses several different tickets:\r\n[KAFKA-15696](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15696)/[KAFKA-15548](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15548)\r\n\r\nWhen closing the consumer we need to perform a few tasks. **_And here is the top level overview:_**\r\nWe want to keep the network thread alive until we are ready to shutdown, i.e., no more requests need to be sent out.  To achieve so, I implemented a method, `signalClose()` to signal the managers to prepare for shutdown.  Once we signal the network thread to close, the manager will prepare for the request to be sent out on the next event loop.  The network thread can then be closed after issuing these events.  The application thread's task is pretty straightforward, 1. tell the background thread to perform n events and 2. block on certain events until succeed or the timer runs out.  Once all requests are sent out, we close the network thread and other components as usual.\r\n\r\n**Here I outline the changes in detail**\r\n- AsynckafkaConsumer: Shutdown procedures, and several utility functions to ensure proper exceptions are thrown during shutdown\r\n- AsyncKafkaConsumerTest: I examine each individual test and fix ones that are blocking for too long or logging errors\r\n- CommitRequestManager: signalClose()\r\n- FetchRequestManagerTest: changes due to change in pollOnClose()\r\n- ApplicationEventProcessor: handle commitOnClose and LeaveGroupOnClose.  Latter, it triggers leaveGroup() which should be completed on the next heartbeat (or we timeout on the application thread)","created_at":"2023-12-06T08:09:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-19T12:20:34Z","closed_at":"2023-12-19T12:20:34Z","merged_at":"2023-12-19T12:20:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e37ec80f840be78d12694ea967d409d943f9a03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

in the PR are to support excluding `client_id` label when sending telemetry metrics.\r\n\r\nSome of the labels/tags which are present in metric should be skipped while collecting telemetry as data might already be known to broker hence, we should minimize the data transfer. One of such labels is client_id which is already present in RequestContext hence broker can append that label prior emitting metrics to telemetry backend.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

patch adds two cases to EventHandlerExceptionInfo for exceptions thrown by the log layer. Prior to this change, the log could throw a CorruptRecordException and the QuorumController would not treat it as a fatal exception. E.g., \r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [ControllerServer id=9990] handleCommit[baseOffset=192554233]: event failed with CorruptRecordException in 234 microseconds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy treating these errors as non-fatal, the controller does not immediately crash itself which could lead to all kinds of problems with the metadata log since a batch of records was not processed.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T21:38:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T03:38:41Z","closed_at":"2025-01-03T03:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

Kafka consumer makes a variety of requests to brokers such as fetching committed offsets and updating metadata. In the `LegacyKafkaConsumer`, the approach is typically to prepare RPC requests and then poll the network to wait for responses. In the `AsyncKafkaConsumer`, the approach is to enqueue an `ApplicationEvent` for processing by one of the request managers on the background thread. However, it is still important to wait for responses rather than spinning enqueuing events for the request managers before they have had a chance to respond.\r\n\r\nIn general, the behaviour will not be changed by this code. The `PlaintextConsumerTest.testSeek` test was flaky because operations such as `KafkaConsumer.position` were not properly waiting for a response which meant that subsequent operations were being attempted in the wrong state. This test is no longer flaky.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

cleanup to make it easier to follow the restore listener logic. Currently, the KafkaStreams class tracks two restore listener  fields: there is a non-final, nullable \"globalRestoreListener\" that holds the restore listener specified by the user (if any), and then there is a final \"delegatingRestoreListener\" that's used to encapsulate the null checks for the user-specified restore listener. It's a bit confusing to follow along with what each of these restore listener fields is doing and the relationship between them when they're on equal footing like this, when in reality they're more hierarchical and the DelegatingRestoreListener is actually a wrapper over the user-specified globalRestoreListener. The term \"global\" is also a bit misleading as it can get mixed up with global state stores, when it's really meant to be \"global\" in the sense that it applies to all state stores in the application. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to just move the user listener completely inside the DelegatingRestoreListener class and then make that class static, as well as renaming the field to \"userRestoreListener\"","created_at":"2023-11-30T23:31:34Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T18:38:55Z","closed_at":"2023-12-06T18:38:54Z","merged_at":"2023-12-06T18:38:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ca6e3e359897f69fd8c44d71be0ab7bca644351","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cadonna","id":1042170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna","html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2ce948806971411cfa54cd4e5974a6013c86f24c","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:MINOR-move-user-restore-listener-into-delegate","ref":"MINOR-move-user-restore-listener-into-delegate","sha":"2ce948806971411cfa54cd4e5974a6013c86f24c","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":

following race can happen in the state updater code path\r\n\r\n - Task is restoring, owned by state updater\r\n - We fall out of the consumer group, lose all partitions\r\n - We therefore register a \"TaskManager.pendingUpdateAction\", to CLOSE_DIRTY\r\n - We also register a \"StateUpdater.taskAndAction\" to remove the task\r\n - We get the same task reassigned. Since it's still owned by the state updater, we don't do much\r\n - The task completes restoration\r\n - The \"StateUpdater.taskAndAction\" to remove will be ignored, since it's already restored\r\n - Inside \"handleRestoredTasksFromStateUpdater\", we close the task dirty because of the pending update action\r\n - We now have the task assigned, but it's closed.\r\n\r\nTo fix this particular race, we cancel the \"close\" pending update action. Furthermore, since we may have made progress in other threads during the missed rebalance, we need to add the task back to the state updater, to at least check if we are still at the end of the changelog. Finally, it seems we do not need to close dirty here, it's enough to close clean when we lose the task, related to [KAFKA-10532](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10532). \r\n\r\nThis should fix the flaky EOSIntegrationTest.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

patch adds the `reports.junitXml.mergeReruns` setting to gradle build. From the [doc](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#mergereruns):\r\n\r\n> When mergeReruns is enabled, if a test fails but is then retried and succeeds, its failures will be recorded as `<flakyFailure>` instead of `<failure>`, within one `<testcase>`. This is effectively the reporting produced by the [surefire plugin of Apache Maven™](https://maven.apache.org/components/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html) when enabling reruns. If your CI server understands this format, it will indicate that the test was flaky. If it does not, it will indicate that the test succeeded as it will ignore the `<flakyFailure>` information. If the test does not succeed (i.e. it fails for every retry), it will be indicated as having failed whether your tool understands this format or not.\r\n\r\nThe patch also increases the `maxTestRetryFailures` to `50`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

We cannot generate a snapshot at the high watermark after loading all batches because it may contain records that have not yet been committed. We also don't know where the high watermark will advance up to so we need to generate a snapshot for each offset the loader observes to be greater than the current high watermark. Then once we add the high watermark listener and update the high watermark we can delete all of the older snapshots. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify
