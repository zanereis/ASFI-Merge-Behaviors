code samples are fetched from Beam Github's master branch. So in order to make change in code and then write a document piece with code sample, it was necessary create 2 PRs - one with change in code and another with change in documentation. This PR solves this issue by using local code to build code samples for documentation instead of fetching it from Github.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is part of adding SnowflakeIO to Java SDK [BEAM-9893](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9893). Precisely this PR is adding write operation to SnowflakeIO [BEAM-9894](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9894).\r\n\r\nThe SnowflakeIO.Write works in the way that puts data on GCS as CSV files and then uses Snowflake's JDBC driver to run [COPY INTO TABLE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table.html) statement to move CSV files from GCS to Snowflake table.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous [PR](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11360),  next PR’s will contain integration tests, streaming and cross-language support.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

closed reader check,  in it's current position prevents the \"normal teardown\" that the reader expects. This means that readers for instructions that terminate early such as due to splitting stay resident in memory and never close.\r\n\r\nIn practice this is benign as the buffer would already be closed, but with streaming this memory leak would become noticable.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the check to after the sentinel check, and additionally check there for early termination to avoid closing the buffer twice.\r\n\r\nSince this largely affects the goroutine local cache, no test changes are possible.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this PR, you can find a fork of the latest version of all of the current Java Beam Katas that have been ported to use Kotlin with the associated conversions and dependencies made. \r\n\r\nA summary of the changes can be found below:\r\n\r\n- Added appropriate Kotlin-based dependencies for gradle (specific to the Kotlin Katas directory)\r\n- Converted all existing `*.java` tasks files over to Kotlin (e.g. `*.kt`) and updated all of the placeholders where applicable\r\n- Verified that all of the unit tests backing the tasks are passing as expected using the existing input.\r\n- Removed all of the original course metadata (e.g. `*-remote-info.yaml files) assuming that the creation of a new course will overwrite these.\r\n\r\nOnce the pull-request has been merged (pending any changes), any feedback or recommendations regarding publishing the course to Stepik would be helpful to get the content out to the larger, public audience.\r\n\r\nCC: @henryken

an issue where if the language setting in the docs is toggled to something like Python, all examples that were only in Java disappeared completely. R: @pabloem \r\n\r\nUsually, docs would look like this (in the Programming Guide) with Java on:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689183/82466592-a1466480-9a8e-11ea-9378-22805a9723c0.png)\r\n\r\nWith Python on, however, the docs look like this, which is confusing since it seems like the docs are incomplete:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689183/82466581-9ab7ed00-9a8e-11ea-92ff-4d861bd289ea.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the docs look like this on Python:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689183/82466646-af948080-9a8e-11ea-8473-e3ab69c9e78c.png)\r\n\r\nI used a script (https://gist.github.com/epicfaace/23e8dab04bd290659f2db1feccd57891) to update the docs on the Programming Guide. If we are good with this approach, we could do this for other doc files that require updating as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, although this helps in most cases, in some cases we actually don't want to show placeholder code for unavailable code snippets. For example, in this case the Java doc looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689183/82468012-54638d80-9a90-11ea-9621-be0d497431f9.png)\r\n\r\nCurrent Python docs look like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689183/82468059-63e2d680-9a90-11ea-9d78-eaaeaaa5e26b.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, with this PR, we have an empty code sample that isn't really relevant, because the sample is only relevant in Java:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689183/82468176-7f4de180-9a90-11ea-83e4-009036f45f9a.png)\r\n\r\nI was thinking we might have to manually go and remove the placeholder snippets for snippets that should only show conditionally. Would appreciate feedback / thoughts on this!\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

This assumption was not correct because more data can be available\r\nlater.

is the basic implementation of `ReadFromKafkaViaSDF`.\r\nSupports included in this implementation:\r\n- Initial restriction\r\n- Progress and size\r\n- Checkpoint\r\n\r\nFuture worker includes:\r\n- Add `CommitOffsetTransform` and expand `ReadFromKafkaViaSDF` with it when `commitOffset()` is enabled: [BEAM-10123](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10123)\r\n- Make it work with x-lang both for `KafkaIO.Read` when `useSDFTransform()` is enabled and using `ReadFromKafkaViaSDF` directly. \r\n- Provide a new API `withTopicPattern` for `KafkaIO.Read` . This can be done by adding another SDF which watches growth of topics.\r\n\r\nAny other proposal of future works are welcomed : )\r\n\r\nr: @aromanenko-dev(assuming you are interested in this : ) )\r\nr: @lukecwik \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

two Python katas about windowing fail because the timestamps for the elements are calculated based on the local timezone, and my timezone does not match the timezone hardcoded in the tests, and because parsing from strings using `fromisoformat` was failing.\r\n\r\nIn the first Kata, the timestamp was calculated from time objects, and converted to a timestamp in the local timezone. Thus, the results of the test depended on the configuration of the local timezone in the running system.\r\n\r\nThe tests were hardcoded with a timezone different to mine, and thus I always failed to pass this Kata. The changes in this commit change the type in `Event` to be a `datetime`, the timestamps are set in UTC, and the output in the tests is hardcoded in UTC too. This should ensure that the kata works regardless the timezone configured in the system running the kata.\r\n\r\nIn the second Kata, the code was failing with the following error:\r\n\r\n```AttributeError: type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'fromisoformat'```\r\n\r\nI changed the timestamps to be set using the `datetime` constructor, rather than parsing from strings using `fromisoformat`.\r\n\r\nBoth katas now pass with the examples hardcoded in the corresponding tests.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
