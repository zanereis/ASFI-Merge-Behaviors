Putting the expected exceptions on the AdminClient method is rather distant from where they're actually throw (the Future from the Map from the Results from the call), but it keeps the documentation about the method as a whole in one place.

so that they can be easily shared by different messages.","created_at":"2017-09-19T19:14:21Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T03:40:41Z","closed_at":"2024-11-15T03:40:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

don't let analyzing this PR take away from actual working time. I did this in my spare time, it's not intended to take away from your working hours. It may well be that this is a non-issue.\r\n\r\nAs the title states: I added equals() method to Stamped.java because a class that implements Comparable should always have this.\r\n\r\nThis was pointed out to me by Intellij's code analysis, which warned that classes implementing Comparable should always implement both compareTo() and equals(). This is because an end-user can at some point add objects of that class to java.util.SortedSet. If the compareTo() and equals() implementations are not consistent, that would violate the contract of java.util.Set, which is defined in terms of equals().\r\n\r\nfindBugs also complained about PunctuationScheduler, a subclass of Stamped, nothing having equals, so I also implemented that.\r\n\r\nThe equals() in Stamped.java is written to be consistent with how the already-existing compareTo() works in that class. The hashCode() is autogenerated, with only the timestamp field, as that is the only one used by compareTo() and equals().\r\n\r\nfindBugs complained about PunctuationSchedule.java, a subclass of Stamped.java, also needing these methods if Stamped.java had them. So I had equals() and hashCode() auto-generated for them.\r\n\r\n./gradlew test ran fine.","created_at":"2017-09-19T16:06:17Z","updated_at":"2017-11-16T19:11:26Z","closed_at":"2017-11-16T19:11:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2709905eeb6b102b235da4d7c1d608b4ba041fa3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/aea3d72aa5f6854a845e76eb4359ca456ae7209f","head":{"label":"KoenDG:stampedEquals","ref":"stampedEquals","sha":"aea3d72aa5f6854a845e76eb4359ca456ae7209f","user":{"login":"KoenDG","id":1440619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDA2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1440619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG","html_url":"https://github.com/KoenDG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KoenDG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"2703fda52a14eeae70b206b19a47c5acd4a83915","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

the `TopicResponse` part of the `MetadataResponse` to include the message format version and the message max bytes.\r\n\r\nOne problem here is that we use the `TopicConfigHandler` to listen for topic changes. However this is not invoked for topic _creates_ since the change notification path is not updated during creates. I am not sure what the right solution is here. Intuitively, we should update the the change notification path for topic creates, but not sure if that has compatibility (or other) implications.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. Add a more complete integration test where the client sends a real `MetadataRequest` and receives the proper `MetadataResponse`.\r\n2. Update the code to pull the global topic config during startup. The present patch only contains configs for the topics present on each broker.\r\n3. Update `AdminUtils.createTopic` to update the change notification path so that each broker gets notified of topic creations and can update its topic config cache.","created_at":"2017-09-19T06:09:54Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T03:40:36Z","closed_at":"2024-11-15T03:40:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

After optimization, it will reduce to less than 1minute.","created_at":"2017-09-19T03:06:32Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T03:06:59Z","closed_at":"2018-08-07T03:06:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"984d5a2fc1af2c47d4fc1882e20d235842644494","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5e9641e98ac5bf3e605289e7c29d1683a7d7a864","head":{"label":"uncleGen:KAFKA-5928","ref":"KAFKA-5928","sha":"5e9641e98ac5bf3e605289e7c29d1683a7d7a864","user":{"login":"uncleGen","id":7402327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7402327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen","html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81780374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTc4MDM3NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"uncleGen/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uncleGen","id":7402327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7402327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen","html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen/kafka","description":"Mirror

of all, terribly sorry for not having included this in the previous PR, that one only focused on the streams folder, this one is on the entire project. I realized my mistake too late.\r\n\r\nI do need some input for this one, I left 2 TODO statements in the code that I'll point out.\r\n\r\nThis commit largely replaces string concatenation with placeholders in debug and trace log statements. Other things I'll point out with comments.\r\n\r\nFor historical purposes, on why replacing string concatenation with placeholders: When running an application on a certain log level, one wants to avoid log statements of more detailed levels actually being evaluated, both due to potential size issues and time spent doing it, since they're not actually going to be printed. If the message being passed to the log method utilizes string concatenation directly in the passed argument, that means the string will be fully evaluated before being passed along to the log method, to then potentially not even be shown, if the application is running on a different log level.\r\n\r\nUsing placeholders prevents this from happening.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ran the tests: \r\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 30m 59s\r\n90 actionable tasks: 90

KIP-195.\r\n\r\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds AdminClient.createPartitions() and the network protocol is\r\nuses. The broker-side algorithm is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. KafkaApis makes some initial checks on the request, then delegates to the\r\n   new AdminManager.createPartitions() method.\r\n2. AdminManager.createPartitions() performs some validation then delegates to\r\n   AdminUtils.addPartitions().\r\n\r\nAside: I felt it was safer to add the extra validation in\r\nAdminManager.createPartitions() than in AdminUtils.addPartitions() since the\r\nlatter is used on other code paths which might fail differently with the\r\nintroduction of extra checks.\r\n\r\n3. AdminUtils.addPartitions() does its own checks and adds the partitions.\r\n4. AdminManager then uses the existing topic purgatory to wait for the\r\n   PartitionInfo available from the metadata cache to become consistent with\r\n   the new total number of partitions.\r\n\r\nThe messages of exceptions thrown in AdminUtils affecting this new API have\r\nbeen made consistent with initial capital letter and terminating period.\r\nA few have been reworded for clarity. I've also standardized on using\r\nString.format().\r\n\r\ncc

See that issue and [KIP-196 for details](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-196%3A+Add+metrics+to+Kafka+Connect+framework).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds metrics for each connector using Kafka’s existing `Metrics` framework. This is the first of several changes to add several groups of metrics, this change starts by adding a very simple `ConnectMetrics` object that is owned by each worker and that makes it easy to define multiple groups of metrics, called `ConnectMetricGroup` objects. Each metric group maps to a JMX MBean, and each metric within the group maps to an MBean attribute.\r\n\r\nFuture PRs will build upon this simple pattern to add metrics for source and sink tasks, workers, and worker rebalances.","created_at":"2017-09-14T22:45:43Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T06:05:12Z","closed_at":"2017-09-22T20:19:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e87b28fc6c4673b1e32c864ec8f57737d70216fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ddce876ba753834dbb9b0b51db9874a81df9597b","head":{"label":"rhauch:kafka-5899","ref":"kafka-5899","sha":"ddce876ba753834dbb9b0b51db9874a81df9597b","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40898643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDg5ODY0Mw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"rhauch/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch/kafka","description":"Mirror

So muted is no longer used in `RecordAccumulator.expiredBatches`.\r\n4. In some rare situations batch.done may be called twice. Attempted transitions from failed to succeeded are logged. Successful to successful is an error (exception as before). Other transitions (failed-->aborted, aborted-->failed) are ignored.\r\n5. The old test from `RecordAccumulatorTest` is removed. It has three additional tests. `testExpiredBatchSingle`, `testExpiredBatchesSize`, `testExpiredBatchesRetry`.

also KIP-183.\r\n\r\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\r\n\r\nThis implements the following algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. AdminClient sends ElectPreferredLeadersRequest.\r\n2. KafakApis receives ElectPreferredLeadersRequest and delegates to\r\n   ReplicaManager.electPreferredLeaders()\r\n3. ReplicaManager delegates to KafkaController.electPreferredLeaders()\r\n4. KafkaController adds a PreferredReplicaLeaderElection to the EventManager,\r\n5. ReplicaManager.electPreferredLeaders()'s callback uses the\r\n   delayedElectPreferredReplicasPurgatory to wait for the results of the\r\n   election to appear in the metadata cache. If there are no results\r\n   because of errors, or because the preferred leaders are already leading\r\n   the partitions then a response is returned immediately.\r\n\r\nIn the EventManager work thread the preferred leader is elected as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The EventManager runs PreferredReplicaLeaderElection.process()\r\n2. process() calls KafkaController.onPreferredReplicaElectionWithResults()\r\n3. KafkaController.onPreferredReplicaElectionWithResults()\r\n   calls the PartitionStateMachine.handleStateChangesWithResults() to\r\n   perform the election (asynchronously the PSM will send LeaderAndIsrRequest\r\n   to the new and old leaders and UpdateMetadataRequest to all brokers)\r\n   then invokes the callback.\r\n\r\nNote: the change in parameter type for CollectionUtils.groupDataByTopic().\r\nThis makes sense because the AdminClient APIs use Collection consistently,\r\nrather than List or Set. If binary compatiblity is a consideration the old\r\nversion should be kept, delegating to the new version.\r\n\r\nI had to add PartitionStateMachine.handleStateChangesWithResults()\r\nin order to be able to process a set of state changes in the\r\nPartitionStateMachine *and get back individual results*.\r\nAt the same time I noticed that all callers of existing handleStateChange()\r\nwere destructuring a TopicAndPartition that they already had in order\r\nto call handleStateChange(), and that handleStateChange() immediately\r\ninstantiated a new TopicAndPartition. Since TopicAndPartition is immutable\r\nthis is pointless, so I refactored it. handleStateChange() also now returns\r\nany exception it caught, which is necessary for handleStateChangesWithResults()","created_at":"2017-09-13T15:59:35Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T08:24:36Z","closed_at":"2019-01-25T22:06:19Z","merged_at":"2019-01-25T22:06:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"269b65279c746bc54c611141a5a6509f9b310f11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9df18c6b3232f3e8b9bf879b7a8dd762a5968c6c","head":{"label":"tombentley:KAFKA-5692-elect-preferred","ref":"KAFKA-5692-elect-preferred","sha":"9df18c6b3232f3e8b9bf879b7a8dd762a5968c6c","user":{"login":"tombentley","id":879487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/879487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley","html_url":"https://github.com/tombentley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93850932,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mzg1MDkzMg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"tombentley/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tombentley","id":879487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/879487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley","html_url":"https://github.com/tombentley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tombentley/kafka","description":"Mirror

EasyMock 3.5 supports Java 9.\r\n\r\n- Fixed issues in `testFailedSendRetryLogic` and\r\n`testCreateConnectorAlreadyExists` exposed by new EasyMock\r\nversion. The former was passing `anyObject` to\r\n`andReturn`, which doesn't make sense. This was leaving\r\nbehind a global `any` matcher, which caused a few issues in\r\nthe new version. Fixing this meant that the correlation ids had\r\nto be updated to actually match. The latter was missing a\r\ncouple of expectations that the previous version of EasyMock\r\ndidn't catch.\r\n\r\n- Removed unnecessary PowerMock dependency from 3 tests.\r\n\r\n- Disabled remaining PowerMock tests when running with Java 9\r\nuntil https://github.com/powermock/powermock/issues/783 is\r\nin a release.\r\n\r\n- Once we merge this PR, we can enable tests in the Java 9 builds\r\nin
