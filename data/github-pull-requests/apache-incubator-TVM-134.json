Hybrid Frontend Developer Guide\r\n\r\nThis hybrid frontend is aimed at:\r\n1. Building IR in a more intuitive way\r\n2. Writing preliminary versions of some idioms that yet have not been supported by\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Software emulation\r\n\r\nThis feature supports both software emulation and compilation of the code.\r\n\r\nTo define a function, you need to use `tvm.hybrid.script` decorator to indicate this is a hybrid function:\r\n````Python\r\n@tvm.hybrid.script\r\ndef outer_product(a, b, c):\r\n    for i in range(a.shape[0]):\r\n        for j in range(b.shape[0]):\r\n            c[i, j] = a[i] * b[j]\r\na = numpy.random.rand(100)\r\nb = numpy.random.rand(99)\r\nc = numpy.zeros((100, 99))\r\nouter_product(a, b)\r\n````\r\nThis decorator will help you to import [key words](#keywords) required spontaneously when software emulation.\r\nEvery element in the argument list is either a python variable or `numpy` tensor.\r\n\r\n### Backend Compilation\r\n\r\nThe current parse interface looks like:\r\n````Python\r\na = tvm.placeholder((100, ), name='a')\r\nb = tvm.placeholder((99, ), name='b')\r\nc = tvm.placeholder((100, 99), name='c')\r\ntvm.hybrid.parse(outer_product, [a, b, c]) # return an ir root of this function\r\n````\r\n**TODO**: If we pass these tvm tensors to this function, it returns a op node:\r\n````Python\r\na = tvm.placeholder((100, ), name='a')\r\nb = tvm.placeholder((99, ), name='b')\r\nc = tvm.placeholder((100, 99), name='c')\r\nop = outer_product(a, b, c) # return the corresponding op node\r\n````\r\n#### Scheduling\r\n\r\n**Under construction, not truly supported yet.**\r\n\r\nFollow up the example above, you can use some tvm like interfaces to manipulate the structure of IR:\r\n````Python\r\nsch = tvm.create_schedule(op)\r\njo, ji = sch.split(j, 4)\r\nsch.vectorize(ji)\r\n````\r\n`split`, `reorder`, and loop_annotation will be supported!\r\n\r\n### Attributes\r\nSo far, ONLY tensors' `shape` attribute is supported!\r\n\r\n### Loops\r\n\r\nIn HalideIR, loops have in total 4 types: `serail`, `unrolled`, `parallel`, and `vectorized`.\r\n\r\nHere we use `range`, `serial`, `unroll`, `parallel`, and `vectorize`, these **5** keywords to annotate the types of for loops.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: In HalideIR those are enums, they are in passive form. Here we use active form to annotate loops, because they are ready to run.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Unlike what that is in HalideIR, in `loop_type(a, b)`, `a` is the starting point and `b` is the trip count of iterations. Here `loop_type(a, b)` indicates `[a, b)`.\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nBecause there is no variables in `HalideIR`, all the mutatable variables will be lowered to an array with size 1.\r\nIt takes the first store of a variable as its declaration.\r\n**NOTE**: Unlike conventional Python, the declared array can only be used in the scope level it is declared.\r\n````Python\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for j in range(5):\r\n    \tsum += a[i, j] #do something with sum\r\n    b[i] = sum #you can still use sum in this level\r\n#you can NEVER use some here, even though it is allowed in conventional Python\r\na[0] = sum\r\n````\r\n### Conditional Statement and Expression\r\n\r\n````Python\r\nif condition:\r\n    # do something\r\na = b if condition else c\r\n````\r\nHowever, NO `True` and `False` keyword supported yet.\r\n\r\n### Math intrinsics\r\nSo far, these math intrinsics, `log`, `exp`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `power`, and `popcount`, are supported. No import is required, just use it!\r\n### Array allocation\r\n**TODO**: Use a function call `allocation(shape, type, share/local)` to declare an array buffer. The basic usage is roughly the same as variables\r\n### Thread bind\r\nYou can also do loop-thread bind by writing code like this:\r\n````Python\r\nfor tx in bind(\"threadIdx.x\", 100):\r\n    a[tx] = b[tx]\r\n````\r\n## Appendix\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"keywords\"> Keywords </a>\r\n- Statement keywords: `for`, `in`, `if`, `else`\r\n- For keywords: `serial`, `range`, `unroll`, `parallel`, `vectorize`, `bind`\r\n- Math keywords: `log`, `exp`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `power`, `popcount`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-08T20:23:37Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T01:06:26Z","closed_at":"2018-06-22T20:47:46Z","merged_at":"2018-06-22T20:47:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"290226e1c9adbb3e598f9ed9184018df1c12be33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

the tracker uses the IP address of the connection when a new rpc server registers.\r\nIn the case of a network topology where the tracker is behind a NAT/firewall, the registering RPC server's connection will appear to come from another device from within the NAT (e.g., if we use an ssh tunnel).\r\nThis PR allows the registering RPC server to specify a custom IP at `PUT` time so RPC requests to the tracker can receive the actual address of the server.","created_at":"2018-06-06T22:30:47Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T04:32:38Z","closed_at":"2018-06-08T04:32:38Z","merged_at":"2018-06-08T04:32:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"088939febf18b3ee61d17427c0cafee13698f0a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/db1670537195da65e0cea4bcb1a226eec7f5ccc6","head":{"label":"eqy:eqy-rpc","ref":"eqy-rpc","sha":"db1670537195da65e0cea4bcb1a226eec7f5ccc6","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109762891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk3NjI4OTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"eqy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eqy/tvm","description":"End

SSD support in NNVM. Create a tutorial to show how to deploy MXNet SSD model on CPU. This PR also enhances nnvm.compiler.build so that user can specify the last operator of the network to be compiled on a different target device. This can be a short-term solution for SSD to run on GPU, since currently it's not easy to directly implement multibox operators on GPU. After multibox_prior implemented on GPU(@Laurawly), we can add this into tutorial to show how to run major part of SSD on GPU and the final multi box_detection operator on

hybrid frontend is aimed at:\r\n1. Building IR in a more intuitive way\r\n2. Writing preliminary versions of some idioms that yet have not been supported by\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## Software emulation\r\nThis feature supports both software emulation and compilation of the code.\r\n\r\nTo define a function, you need to use `tvm.hybrid.script` decorator to indicate this is a hybrid function:\r\n````Python\r\n@tvm.hybrid.script\r\ndef outer_product(a, b, c):\r\n    for i in range(a.shape[0]):\r\n        for j in range(b.shape[0]):\r\n            c[i, j] = a[i] * b[j]\r\na = numpy.random.rand(100)\r\nb = numpy.random.rand(99)\r\nc = numpy.zeros((100, 99))\r\nouter_product(a, b)\r\n````\r\nThis decorator will help you to import [key words](#keywords) required spontaneously when software emulation.\r\nEvery element in the argument list is either a python variable or `numpy` tensor.\r\n## Backend Compilation\r\nThe current parse interface looks like:\r\n````Python\r\na = tvm.placeholder((100, ), name='a')\r\nb = tvm.placeholder((99, ), name='b')\r\nc = tvm.placeholder((100, 99), name='c')\r\ntvm.hybrid.parse(outer_product, [a, b, c]) # return an ir root of this function\r\n````\r\n**TODO**: If we pass these tvm tensors to this function, it returns a op node:\r\n````Python\r\na = tvm.placeholder((100, ), name='a')\r\nb = tvm.placeholder((99, ), name='b')\r\nc = tvm.placeholder((100, 99), name='c')\r\nop = outer_product(a, b, c) # return the corresponding op node\r\n````\r\n### Scheduling\r\n**Under construction, not truly supported yet.**\r\n\r\nFollow up the example above, you can use some tvm like interfaces to manipulate the structure of IR:\r\n````Python\r\nsch = tvm.create_schedule(op)\r\njo, ji = sch.split(j, 4)\r\nsch.vectorize(ji)\r\n````\r\n`split`, `reorder`, and loop_annotation will be supported!\r\n## Attributes\r\nSo far, ONLY tensors' `shape` attribute is supported!\r\n\r\n## Loops\r\nIn HalideIR, loops have in total 4 types: `serail`, `unrolled`, `parallel`, and `vectorized`.\r\n\r\nHere we use `range`, `serial`, `unroll`, `parallel`, and `vectorize`, these **5** keywords to annotate the types of for loops.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: In HalideIR those are enums, they are in passive form. Here we use active form to annotate loops, because they are ready to run.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Unlike what that is in HalideIR, in `loop_type(a, b)`, `a` is the starting point and `b` is the trip count of iterations. Here `loop_type(a, b)` indicates `[a, b)`.\r\n\r\n## Variables\r\nBecause there is no variables in `HalideIR`, all the mutatable variables will be lowered to an array with size 1.\r\nIt takes the first store of a variable as its declaration.\r\n**NOTE**: Unlike conventional Python, the declared array can only be used in the scope level it is declared.\r\n````Python\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for j in range(5):\r\n    \tsum += a[i, j] #do something with sum\r\n    b[i] = sum #you can still use sum in this level\r\n#you can NEVER use some here, even though it is allowed in conventional Python\r\na[0] = sum\r\n````\r\n## Conditional Statement and Expression\r\n````Python\r\nif condition:\r\n    # do something\r\na = b if condition else c\r\n````\r\nHowever, NO `True` and `False` keyword supported yet.\r\n## Math intrinsics\r\nSo far, these math intrinsics, `log`, `exp`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `power`, and `popcount`, are supported. No import is required, just use it!\r\n## Array allocation\r\n**TODO**: Use a function call `allocation(shape, type, share/local)` to declare an array buffer. The basic usage is roughly the same as variables\r\n## Thread bind\r\nYou can also do loop-thread bind by writing code like this:\r\n````Python\r\nfor tx in bind(\"threadIdx.x\", 100):\r\n    a[tx] = b[tx]\r\n````\r\n# Appendix\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"keywords\"> Keywords </a>\r\n- Statement keywords: `for`, `in`, `if`, `else`\r\n- For keywords: `serial`, `range`, `unroll`, `parallel`, `vectorize`, `bind`\r\n- Math keywords: `log`, `exp`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `power`, `popcount`","created_at":"2018-05-19T01:08:39Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T20:14:35Z","closed_at":"2018-06-08T20:14:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4468fdef9ced9ac26d592ece9975bfcf935adc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/dbdad17d08eec89c3033e9e6bdf4d80fe9e86594","head":{"label":"were:master","ref":"master","sha":"dbdad17d08eec89c3033e9e6bdf4d80fe9e86594","user":{"login":"were","id":2356965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2356965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/were","html_url":"https://github.com/were","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e3529922a6e94528558ae6b35c5216ace217b2e2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

ResNet & VGG works fine with this PR (coz by `alter_conv2d_layout` we replace conv2d by conv2d_NCHWc, skipping the optimization in `fold_scale_axis`), but if we remove the function `alter_conv2d_layout` and run ResNet50-v2 with `opt_level=3`, we'll see the problem.\r\nMoreover, `squeeze_net`'s output (https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/model_zoo.html) is not correct, not sure whether it is caused by same
