Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-07T07:50:51Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T16:01:24Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T16:01:24Z","merged_at":"2021-02-23T16:01:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"6810671ddeba01b845b9429ff3360cdd02d54dc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/36","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/36","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/36/labels","id":5867716,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTg2NzcxNg==","number":36,"title":"2.7.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":42,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-11T13:50:28Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T17:13:26Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-05-06T17:13:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/80367e24a1229a32a43fbac470956c209cda2df8","head":{"label":"LiosWong:fix-bug","ref":"fix-bug","sha":"80367e24a1229a32a43fbac470956c209cda2df8","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4d3316b87d18d37ce982928052fd5451f63cea92","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptio

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix issue: #6108，修改生成Cluster$Adaptive时，不调用getUrl()而是调用getConsumerUrl()来获取url\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/5686\r\n修复5686这个issue后，原先url中的refer信息被删除，refer信息被放在了consumerUrl中，导致Cluster$Adaptive的getUrl无法获取到对应的Cluster实现，因此在生成Cluster$Adaptive时，需要变为getConsumerUrl\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-07T06:29:08Z","updated_at":"2020-05-25T03:03:52Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T08:17:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52827ac46859f888e6ee7706d5c81feae5355442","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f823620de6f49f49b791a60ed1aec4737d7c7c47","head":{"label":"juliuszhang:master","ref":"master","sha":"f823620de6f49f49b791a60ed1aec4737d7c7c47","user":{"login":"juliuszhang","id":13173555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13173555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":261965385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjE5NjUzODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"juliuszhang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszhang","id":13173555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13173555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszhang/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-05T12:19:56Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T15:58:10Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T15:58:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21b4d64f9f1292f0e4e3e5a1f437f78c2f732890","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/956834ad2e42c8b1758c56ad098671b0ad0adc7b","head":{"label":"Augustvic:master","ref":"master","sha":"956834ad2e42c8b1758c56ad098671b0ad0adc7b","user":{"login":"Augustvic","id":33082727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgyNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33082727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic","html_url":"https://github.com/Augustvic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2d0d71385d2cd26b97e07c699f84cd58b862cef9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-01T15:28:42Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T06:47:32Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T06:47:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46a8c09e179b1715f8bc79416aa15069af1f37ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need reporters to triage"}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b25573a057eb4af16d28d0c19108f11f7dc0fe1e","head":{"label":"yiduwangkai:master","ref":"master","sha":"b25573a057eb4af16d28d0c19108f11f7dc0fe1e","user":{"login":"yiduwangkai","id":16093572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDkzNTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16093572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai","html_url":"https://github.com/yiduwangkai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiduwangkai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2d0d71385d2cd26b97e07c699f84cd58b862cef9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6082\r\n\r\nSave memory usage in `TagRoute#route()` method.  \r\nIn default call, none invokers will be filtered by `TagRouter`, but `TagRouter` will create a new `List<Invoker<T>>` when every RPC comes. We can use a pre-loop to check whether there have any changes in origin list. If not, we can return origin list directly, otherwise a new `List<Invoker<T>>` will be created.  \r\nIn default circumstance, the time complexity is same with original code, but the space complexity is more less than original's.  \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-29T13:48:32Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T07:09:21Z","closed_at":"2020-07-01T07:09:09Z","merged_at":"2020-07-01T07:09:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"72df0e6cb70cae808d3b04d64bed5b0e07b49ba3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/33/labels","id":5269307,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTI2OTMwNw==","number":33,"title":"2.7.8","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":84,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-03T02:27:18Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T03:21:58Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2020-07-20T03:27:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/784436aa955ae09dab6233f0961c151313acc443","head":{"label":"zjseu:master","ref":"master","sha":"784436aa955ae09dab6233f0961c151313acc443","user":{"login":"zjseu","id":13111067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTExMDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13111067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjseu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":259928319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTk5MjgzMTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zjseu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjseu","id":13111067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTExMDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13111067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjseu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjseu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjseu/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-29T12:27:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T08:56:36Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T08:56:27Z","merged_at":"2020-05-06T08:56:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"6140f5f9eb4d7eb141e7910caeceb564b919b58b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4c85e675d88ac8507702600ae057f42a6fc3b7da","head":{"label":"juliuszhang:master","ref":"master","sha":"4c85e675d88ac8507702600ae057f42a6fc3b7da","user":{"login":"juliuszhang","id":13173555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13173555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7234078e8cf49f4ee0231b6cd0237fb730446dd1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a

initialized.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nadd test to verify the change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-27T09:16:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T10:09:37Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T10:09:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1279b3bb8750b8c9456fd3c4a8595b05d798a82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/74506540c12a07d9a0a13e584d092d2cc259dde0","head":{"label":"drow931:fixbug_reference_annotation","ref":"fixbug_reference_annotation","sha":"74506540c12a07d9a0a13e584d092d2cc259dde0","user":{"login":"drow931","id":11514434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE0NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11514434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931","html_url":"https://github.com/drow931","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":213525900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTM1MjU5MDA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"drow931/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"drow931","id":11514434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE0NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11514434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931","html_url":"https://github.com/drow931","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/drow931/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd new loadbalance strategy based on response time.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nLeastActiveRoadBalance will not work properly when the performance of servers are quite different. The worst provider may have reached limit, then the best one may still free.\r\n\r\nThis strategy is much similar to the LeastActiveRoadBalance, but chooses response time of success calls instead of active connection. \r\n\r\nWe calculate the estimated response time from the product of active connection and succeeded average elapsed time, which means the time this call need to wait, and then choose the least one. If there are multiple invokers and the weights are not the same, then random according to the total weight. If there are multiple invokers and the same weight, then randomly called.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nShotestResponseLoadBalanceTest shows that shortest estimated response invoker or first called invoker or zero active connection invoker will be choosen.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-26T05:19:14Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T06:46:50Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T06:46:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"912dc31f985cbe1281f22d4461934ac09158f5be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

this change\r\n\r\nSimplify \"getActivateExtension\" of ExtensionLoader\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-25T11:10:15Z","updated_at":"2020-04-26T02:07:58Z","closed_at":"2020-04-26T02:07:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35b87777376a5031ecf5d83f4694b265bb2fb7ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5b1da9086e7aede1181093146d3fe60e9564d300","head":{"label":"Augustvic:master","ref":"master","sha":"5b1da9086e7aede1181093146d3fe60e9564d300","user":{"login":"Augustvic","id":33082727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgyNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33082727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic","html_url":"https://github.com/Augustvic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e71ad157b2db8b6133d9ce1413ab80ae31c56652","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAmend the use of CHANNEL_MAP cache.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nNettyChannel (which encapsulates the netty channel) should be added to CHANNEL_MAP cache whether the netty channel is ACTIVE or INACTIVE. I think what determines this is only gc, then we considering the garbage reclaiming mechanism. But in fact, the netty channel state (exists or does not exist) will never affect whether the NettyChannel cleaned by gc or not.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSee Commits.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2020-04-24T02:12:32Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T06:16:00Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T06:16:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db561592f112269929d5a6e3d063287078d72c4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6049/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6049/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6049/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c6e431fee549564482161c7b3ce7f4810c5f1747","head":{"label":"Augustvic:master","ref":"master","sha":"c6e431fee549564482161c7b3ce7f4810c5f1747","user":{"login":"Augustvic","id":33082727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgyNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33082727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic","html_url":"https://github.com/Augustvic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Augustvic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e71ad157b2db8b6133d9ce1413ab80ae31c56652","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T05:42:39Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T01:15:18Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T03:22:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15798d21ca75d48c3babd91c1214c05f70ca134d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d6591e0cdaa30d01fd46489fe217546c17384d4e","head":{"label":"Huangxuny1:remove-servlethttpbinder-adaptive","ref":"remove-servlethttpbinder-adaptive","sha":"d6591e0cdaa30d01fd46489fe217546c17384d4e","user":{"login":"Huangxuny1","id":21981606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTgxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21981606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1","html_url":"https://github.com/Huangxuny1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"dbda44995c86b2a8b91f342885af3a07fe36828a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-19T12:21:09Z","updated_at":"2021-04-16T03:54:30Z","closed_at":"2021-04-16T03:54:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39b00c6494889ccabe4019d49174c43d39cf30a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3160b009730454263a5a62a1c37f1fbc40a3f578","head":{"label":"anLA7856:fix_#6000","ref":"fix_#6000","sha":"3160b009730454263a5a62a1c37f1fbc40a3f578","user":{"login":"anLA7856","id":15212250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjEyMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15212250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856","html_url":"https://github.com/anLA7856","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":256913376,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTY5MTMzNzY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"anLA7856/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anLA7856","id":15212250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjEyMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15212250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856","html_url":"https://github.com/anLA7856","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anLA7856/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-18T14:58:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T02:34:51Z","closed_at":"2020-04-19T02:33:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4732e209f01706b96fe83776ae209bbfddeaff8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6029/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6029/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6029/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9e992f0c6cf27a91ee73a67002cb3df27fc74bfe","head":{"label":"anLA7856:master","ref":"master","sha":"9e992f0c6cf27a91ee73a67002cb3df27fc74bfe","user":{"login":"anLA7856","id":15212250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjEyMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15212250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856","html_url":"https://github.com/anLA7856","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anLA7856/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0def3dc380b75f8f4c00acdc66ee8d5600868d8b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Refactor getSharedClient\r\n- fix #5987\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- The current lock mode\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        locks.putIfAbsent(key, new Object());\r\n        synchronized (locks.get(key)) {\r\n                //do some thing\r\n                //remove lock\r\n                locks.remove(key);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n-  The situation which there is a problem: \r\nWhen thread A finishes executing locks.putIfAbsent(key, new Object()),\r\nanother thread B which holding the lock executes locks.remove(key),\r\nand then thread A executes synchronized (locks.get(key)).\r\n\r\n- Attempt get lock by computeIfAbsent like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        synchronized (locks.computeIfAbsent(key, (k) -> new Object())) {\r\n                try{\r\n                        //do some thing\r\n                } finally {\r\n                        //remove lock\r\n                        locks.remove(key);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n-  The situation which there is a problem: \r\n1.When thread A finishes executing `synchronized (locks.computeIfAbsent(key, (k) -> new Object()))` create the lock `LockA` And synchronized ,\r\n2.Another thread B synchronized with `LockA`,\r\n3.Thread A executes `locks.remove(key)`.\r\n4.Thread B hold the `LockA` And synchronized.\r\n5.Thread C  executing `synchronized (locks.computeIfAbsent(key, (k) -> new Object()))` create the lock `LockC` And synchronized .\r\n-It seems difficult to remove a lock without any threads waiting for it exactly.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun test cases.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

`getAllInterfaces`/`getAllSuperClasses`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun test cases.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-12T11:24:06Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T08:10:11Z","closed_at":"2020-04-24T08:10:11Z","merged_at":"2020-04-24T08:10:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"e71ad157b2db8b6133d9ce1413ab80ae31c56652","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ef600fd23ccb85bec1ee94d8137c26c7c1dcabab","head":{"label":"tangcent:chore/polish-ClassUtils","ref":"chore/polish-ClassUtils","sha":"ef600fd23ccb85bec1ee94d8137c26c7c1dcabab","user":{"login":"tangcent","id":17569144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY5MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17569144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent","html_url":"https://github.com/tangcent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":198956605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg5NTY2MDU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tangcent/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tangcent","id":17569144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY5MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17569144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent","html_url":"https://github.com/tangcent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangcent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tangcent/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-11T05:20:16Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T12:30:34Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T09:03:20Z","merged_at":"2020-04-28T09:03:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"acd6e87ddeba5ea2a491b04799cd55e2dce2541f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4c9983a168d957c8d2eb52029f67135f217b8967","head":{"label":"Huangxuny1:nacos-group-issue","ref":"nacos-group-issue","sha":"4c9983a168d957c8d2eb52029f67135f217b8967","user":{"login":"Huangxuny1","id":21981606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTgxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21981606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1","html_url":"https://github.com/Huangxuny1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"317e62f73fd0a9bac4b34eb8b2c31bbae591ef91","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.co

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-10T08:10:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T08:12:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-10T08:12:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f3a10abc51f3a82ce2d3ab0df8ce31a019e4410","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8e561623bd1a5ece32330f3af6c66df90edfcdfe","head":{"label":"hadesvip:master","ref":"master","sha":"8e561623bd1a5ece32330f3af6c66df90edfcdfe","user":{"login":"hadesvip","id":9640832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDA4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9640832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip","html_url":"https://github.com/hadesvip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"317e62f73fd0a9bac4b34eb8b2c31bbae591ef91","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove consistent hashing load balancing with a new algorithm which can resolve problems mentioned in https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4103\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nA new algorithm \"[Consistent Hashing with Bounded Loads](https://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=444fbd87cfcfb664f18caac119986420&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn#)\"introduced by Vahab Mirrokni (work at Google Research) in 2018 can resolve this problem. \r\n\r\nBrief introduction quoted from a blog which use this new algorithm and works well (https://medium.com/vimeo-engineering-blog/improving-load-balancing-with-a-new-consistent-hashing-algorithm-9f1bd75709ed):\r\n\r\nHere is a simplified sketch of the algorithm. Some details are left out, and if you intend to implement it yourself, you should definitely go to the original paper for information.\r\nFirst, define a balancing factor, c, which is greater than 1. c controls how much imbalance is allowed between the servers. For example, if c = 1.25, no server should get more than 125% of the average load. In the limit as c increases to ∞, the algorithm becomes equivalent to plain consistent hashing, without balancing; as c decreases to near 1 it becomes more like a least-connection policy and the hash becomes less important. In my experience, values between 1.25 and 2 are good for practical use.\r\nWhen a request arrives, compute the average load (the number of outstanding requests, m, including the one that just arrived, divided by the number of available servers, n). Multiply the average load by c to get a “target load”, t. In the original paper, capacities are assigned to servers so that each server gets a capacity of either ⌊t⌋ or ⌈t⌉, and the total capacity is ⌈cm⌉. Therefore the maximum capacity of a server is ⌈cm/n⌉, which is greater than c times the average load by less than 1 request. To support giving servers different “weights”, as HAProxy does, the algorithm has to change slightly, but the spirit is the same — no server can exceed its fair share of the load by more than 1 request.\r\nTo dispatch a request, compute its hash and the nearest server, as usual. If that server is below its capacity, then assign the request to that server. Otherwise, go to the next server in the hash ring and check its capacity, continuing until you find a server that has capacity remaining. There has to be one, since the highest capacity is above the average load, and it’s impossible for every server’s load to be above average. This guarantees some nice things:\r\nNo server is allowed to get overloaded by more than a factor of c plus 1 request.\r\nThe distribution of requests is the same as consistent hashing as long as servers aren’t overloaded.\r\nIf a server is overloaded, the list of fallback servers chosen will be the same for the same request hash — i.e. the same server will consistently be the “second choice” for a popular piece of content. This is good for caching.\r\nIf a server is overloaded, the list of fallback servers will usually be different for different request hashes — i.e. the overloaded server’s spillover load will be distributed among the available servers, instead of all landing on a single server. This depends on each server being assigned multiple points in the consistent hash ring.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-08T12:13:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-16T03:53:36Z","closed_at":"2021-04-16T03:53:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"402652e07efd414ffab848e24963616a16571da9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f8781a15721d26ab54ee3b50a3d93c555f91fed2","head":{"label":"zhouhaopeng:tag_fix","ref":"tag_fix","sha":"f8781a15721d26ab54ee3b50a3d93c555f91fed2","user":{"login":"zhouhaopeng","id":36914462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTE0NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36914462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouhaopeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":253535637,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTM1MzU2Mzc=","name":"zhp_dubbo_fork","full_name":"zhouhaopeng/zhp_dubbo_fork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhouhaopeng","id":36914462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTE0NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36914462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouhaopeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouhaopeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhouhaopeng/zhp_dubbo_fork","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-08T03:14:36Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T09:39:21Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T02:17:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f460b0dc34d7dab392b21a29fd72a5059d1e7ac","assignee":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"qinliujie","id":8599441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8599441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie","html_url":"https://github.com/qinliujie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/33/labels","id":5269307,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTI2OTMwNw==","number":33,"title":"2.7.8","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/u

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-06T15:52:46Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:40:11Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:40:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c026beb215c3b63e40e6048a5fa46d890333c840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix unit test issue for https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/5935\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCI pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-02T05:37:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T06:21:02Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T06:20:58Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T06:20:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b60acc5e52e7f7f34bb2145df530edbc0f897f74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e6e9353dc6b7e895cba3dfd344bebb5afbd90822","head":{"label":"htynkn:chore/fix-ci-0402","ref":"chore/fix-ci-0402","sha":"e6e9353dc6b7e895cba3dfd344bebb5afbd90822","user":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3ce6228f1f3f21507eae2c3882c20cee2e6f2c95","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

DatePattern to parse date string\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-01T15:38:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T09:22:46Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T09:22:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"776c7942d1c0368eb7a0ad01f146cfc0a8b9a589","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/49c0c3703b42e4802145af8c704b33c36ba4ca4f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:time-feat","ref":"time-feat","sha":"49c0c3703b42e4802145af8c704b33c36ba4ca4f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

ThreadPoolExhaustedEventTest、ThreadPoolExhaustedEventListenerTest\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake the build reproducible: see Reproducible Builds https://reproducible-builds.org/\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nupgraded a few plugins as documented in Maven Guide to Configuring for Reproducible Builds\r\nhttps://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-reproducible-builds.html\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nyou can follow the reproducibility test documented on Maven site\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using dubbo, developers always need to get dubbo version to debug online problems. And some popular RPC support command to get RPC version like brpc. So I add version command in qos module.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n \r\nAdd version command in qos module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWhen telnet to port of QOS, dubbo version description like \"dubbo version \"2.7.6\" \" will return when typing command \"version\".\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-28T12:17:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T08:01:01Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T08:01:01Z","merged_at":"2020-04-01T08:01:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3d57cd5b9846fad3752f3446d31caf552da4154","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5935/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5935/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5935/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ada57506a2dc782e33f6f26518165f83feeca834","head":{"label":"laddcn:20200328_qos_add_version_command","ref":"20200328_qos_add_version_command","sha":"ada57506a2dc782e33f6f26518165f83feeca834","user":{"login":"laddcn","id":53557551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTU3NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53557551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn","html_url":"https://github.com/laddcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237559425,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc1NTk0MjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"laddcn/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"laddcn","id":53557551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTU3NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53557551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn","html_url":"https://github.com/laddcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/laddcn/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-26T10:13:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T14:41:43Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T14:41:43Z","merged_at":"2020-04-01T14:41:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f286f549d32e1f8469c08af0d59f6cdeb0cd6da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5921/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5921/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5921/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/506731addb0022f9c13418b2fc888f44fab2fb9a","head":{"label":"hellosx:master","ref":"master","sha":"506731addb0022f9c13418b2fc888f44fab2fb9a","user":{"login":"hellosx","id":13849520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQ5NTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13849520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx","html_url":"https://github.com/hellosx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250222092,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTAyMjIwOTI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hellosx/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hellosx","id":13849520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQ5NTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13849520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx","html_url":"https://github.com/hellosx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hellosx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hellosx/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMaking unit-test can be correctly running on Windows platform and fixing some static port, which is coded into test cases.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- fix: in Windows platform content get from resource contains \\r delimiter\r\n- fix:in Windows Platform hessian2 may unable serialize byte\r\n- fix:in some platform ServerSocket getting random port is not base on 30000\r\n- fix:rename ExplicitCallbackTest to ArgumentCallbackTest owing to junit order\r\n- fix:Windows error 0x70 while starting redis\r\n- fix:fix static port may have been used\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-24T10:22:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T11:28:20Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T11:25:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5205577401757d275076392c6a3d9cfd274dd28d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/66de1ebfb45b7486dfae3a70e4cb2376a8cd5caf","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:unittest-windows-fix","ref":"unittest-windows-fix","sha":"66de1ebfb45b7486dfae3a70e4cb2376a8cd5caf","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n去掉代码里多余的一次判断\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n第一次进入for循环的时候会进入 if (leastActive == -1 || active < leastActive) 里面 因为leastActive 初始值为-1 , 进入else if (active == leastActive)逻辑时上面for循环的i肯定是大于0的,因此无需判断i>0了.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n原有的单元逻辑都能通过.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-23T14:07:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T14:48:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T14:48:21Z","merged_at":"2020-04-01T14:48:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"5312f5f58e5212733612c5dc79cf98bd99da2a2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e5069de616618a52b43de8548c6164f068e6f78d","head":{"label":"xulingfeng931027:dev-源码阅读","ref":"dev-源码阅读","sha":"e5069de616618a52b43de8548c6164f068e6f78d","user":{"login":"xulingfeng931027","id":30265955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30265955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027","html_url":"https://github.com/xulingfeng931027","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":249120790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDkxMjA3OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xulingfeng931027/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xulingfeng931027","id":30265955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjY1OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30265955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027","html_url":"https://github.com/xulingfeng931027","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xulingfeng931027/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xulingfeng931027/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix nacos registry not work bug mentioned with https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5871\r\n, https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5885 and https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5899 \r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nOfficial Demo works out.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-22T15:35:02Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T10:29:34Z","closed_at":"2020-03-31T06:55:11Z","merged_at":"2020-03-31T06:55:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb12928a710a34142e8c6a9b93e532239906a69e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs
