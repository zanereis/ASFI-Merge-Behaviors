What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nfix the bug of HoodieInputFormatUtils.getAffectedPartitions\r\nHoodieInputFormatUtils.getAffectedPartitions use String.contains method to filter the affected partition,  \r\nthis logical  can't distinguish  those partitions which have same prefix correctly：\r\nfor example：  partition1  fullPath is  “/tmp/tableName/p=1”\r\n                         partition2 fullPath is \"/tmp/tableName/p=11\"\r\n                         partition3 fullPath is \"/tmp/tableName/p=111\r\n\r\nassume that  we have a cow hudi table which has three partitions:  \r\npartition1  fullPath is  “/tmp/tableName/p=1”   and this partition has only one file :  file1\r\npartition2 fullPath is \"/tmp/tableName/p=11\"  and this partition has only one file :  file2\r\npartition3 fullPath is \"/tmp/tableName/p=111\"  and this partition has only one file :  file3\r\n\r\nnow we want to query the incr view of this hudi table by sparksql （the incr view involve partition1，partition2，partition3）\r\nsparksql will create  hadoopRdds for each partition and union those rdds,\r\nsince hudi table has three partitions,  spark will create three hadoopRdd( rdd1, rdd2,

But im also fine to leave it here\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n- Sadly i cant run the Deltastream with metadata enabled because of the hbase dependency of Hudi and our Hadoop 3.3.0 containing a to new guava version (21 vs 27). I will open an Issue for this. But i think change is trivial\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSimilar to flink [ConfigOption](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/configuration/ConfigOption.java), and based on the changes in this [pr](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1094/files), I wrote a demo for using configOption for HoodieBootstrapConfig. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of pr is that it binds property key, property defaultValue, property description, property deprecated names together which is straightforward for developers to use. And for the next step, we could also do something similar to Flink to automatically add/update property description on the website: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/configuration/description/Description.java. Also this is extensible, we can bind more features like inference mechanism if needed.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is for users who are now using e.g. ```HoodieBootstrapConfig.BOOTSTRAP_BASE_PATH_PROP``` in their client code, they need to either replace it with ```HoodieBootstrapConfig.BOOTSTRAP_BASE_PATH_PROP.key()``` or ```hoodie.bootstrap.base.path```.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add configOption & refactor HoodieBootstrapConfig\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2021-04-16T01:03:08Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T23:29:02Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T21:26:30Z","merged_at":"2021-06-30T21:26:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"d412fb2fe642417460532044cac162bb68f4bec4","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"umehrot2","id":8647012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8647012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2","html_url":"https://github.com/umehrot2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719804076,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODA0MDc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:minor","name":"priority:minor","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"everything

unit test to ensure new instant time can be generated in multiple threads correctly.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen generating a new instant time in HoodieActiveTimeline, a static instance of SimpleDateFormat is used. This class is not thread safe.\r\n\r\nWe have a production usecase where multiple HUDI datasets are processed in parallel in different threads of a ThreadPool. Each of these threads creates its own SparkRDDBackedWriteClient and calls startCommit() which generates a new commit time. Because SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe, we get corrupted instant times in several threads.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use a thread-specific instance of the SimpleDateFormat for generating new instant times. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMoved static COMMIT_FORMATTER to thread local variable\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test TestHoodieActiveTimeline#testCreateNewInstantTime*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit

pull request\r\nfix flink-client query error when processing files larger than 128mb\r\nUse the flink client to query the cow table and report an error. The error message is as follows:\r\n`Caused by: org.apache.flink.runtime.JobException: Creating the input splits caused an error: org.apache.hadoop.fs.HdfsBlockLocation cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionJobVertex.<init>(ExecutionJobVertex.java:260)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionGraph.attachJobGraph(ExecutionGraph.java:866)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionGraphBuilder.buildGraph(ExecutionGraphBuilder.java:257)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.scheduler.SchedulerBase.createExecutionGraph(SchedulerBase.java:322)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.scheduler.SchedulerBase.createAndRestoreExecutionGraph(SchedulerBase.java:276)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.scheduler.SchedulerBase.<init>(SchedulerBase.java:249)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.scheduler.DefaultScheduler.<init>(DefaultScheduler.java:133)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.scheduler.DefaultSchedulerFactory.createInstance(DefaultSchedulerFactory.java:111)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmaster.JobMaster.createScheduler(JobMaster.java:345)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmaster.JobMaster.<init>(JobMaster.java:330)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmaster.factories.DefaultJobMasterServiceFactory.createJobMasterService(DefaultJobMasterServiceFactory.java:95)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmaster.factories.DefaultJobMasterServiceFactory.createJobMasterService(DefaultJobMasterServiceFactory.java:39)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmaster.JobManagerRunnerImpl.<init>(JobManagerRunnerImpl.java:162)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.dispatcher.DefaultJobManagerRunnerFactory.createJobManagerRunner(DefaultJobManagerRunnerFactory.java:86)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.dispatcher.Dispatcher.lambda$createJobManagerRunner$5(Dispatcher.java:478)\r\n\t... 4 more\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.hadoop.fs.HdfsBlockLocation cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable\r\n\tat java.util.ComparableTimSort.countRunAndMakeAscending(ComparableTimSort.java:320)\r\n\tat java.util.ComparableTimSort.sort(ComparableTimSort.java:188)\r\n\tat java.util.Arrays.sort(Arrays.java:1246)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.format.cow.CopyOnWriteInputFormat.createInputSplits(CopyOnWriteInputFormat.java:212)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.format.cow.CopyOnWriteInputFormat.createInputSplits(CopyOnWriteInputFormat.java:64)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionJobVertex.<init>(ExecutionJobVertex.java:247)\r\n\t... 18 more`\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the implementation object of FileSystem is hadoop, and the BlockLocation implementation class of the getFileBlockLocations method to obtain the block does not implement the compare method. Here, the Arrays.sort method is used for sorting. When the number of blocks is greater than 1, the comparison will report an error. I think the CopyOnWriteInputFormat class imitates FileInputFormat for block fragment acquisition and sorting. The FileInputFormat class implements HadoopBlockLocation to obtain fragmentation information for sorting, and HadoopBlockLocation implements the compareTo method. Here modify the implementation of the incoming inner class to do sorting.\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request supports ORC storage in hudi.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIn two separate commits:\r\n- Implemented HoodieOrcWriter\r\n  - Added HoodieOrcConfigs\r\n  - Added AvroOrcUtils that writes Avro record **to** VectorizedRowBatch\r\n  - Used orc-core:no-hive module (`no-hive` is needed because spark-sql uses no-hive version of orc and it would become easier for spark integration)\r\n- Implemented HoodieOrcReader\r\n  - Read Avro records **from** VectorizedRowBatch\r\n  - Implemented OrcReaderIterator\r\n  - Implemented ORC utility functions \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests for \r\n  - reader/writer creation\r\n  - AvroOrcUtils\r\n- (local) Wrote a small tool that reads from ORC/Parquet files and writes to ORC/Parquet files, verified that the records in the input/output files are identical using spark.read.orc/spark.read.parquet.\r\n- (local) Changed the HoodieTableConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_FILE_FORMAT  to force the tests to run with ORC as the base format. Some changes need to be made, but I'm leaving it out of this PR to get some initial feedback on the reader/writer implementation first.\r\n  For all tests to pass with ORC as the base file format:\r\n  - Understand schema evolution in ORC (ref TestUpdateSchemaEvolution)\r\n  - Add ORC support for places that have hardcoded ParquetReader or sqlContext.read().parquet() \r\n  - Add ORC support for bootstrap op\r\n  - Hive engine integration with ORC (implement HoodieOrcInputFormat, and more)\r\n  - Spark engine integration with ORC (implement HoodieInternalRowOrcWriter, and more)\r\n  - Add ORC support for HoodieSnapshotExporter\r\n  - Implement HDFSOrcImporter\r\n  - and possibly more.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2021-04-08T18:10:12Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T21:07:37Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T21:07:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"954c12e11ddf7e0a5e0cfb007be39128f4667fa8","assignee":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719804076,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODA0MDc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:minor","name":"priority:minor","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"everything

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\ncurrent when hudi bootstrap a parquet file, or upsert into a parquet file which contains timestmap column, it will fail because these issues:\r\n\r\n1) At bootstrap operation, if the origin parquet file was written by a spark application, then spark will default save timestamp as int96(see spark.sql.parquet.int96AsTimestamp), then bootstrap will fail, it’s because of Hudi can not read Int96 type now.(this issue can be solve by upgrade parquet to 1.12.0, and set parquet.avro.readInt96AsFixed=true, please check https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/pull/831/files) \r\n\r\n2) after bootstrap, doing upsert will fail because we use hoodie schema to read origin parquet file. The schema is not match because hoodie schema  treat timestamp as long and at origin file it’s Int96 \r\n\r\n3) after bootstrap, and partial update for a parquet file will fail, because we copy the old record and save by hoodie schema( we miss a convertFixedToLong operation like spark does)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n### Summary:\r\nThis pull request is to fix the archival logic within insert overwrite API against requested & inflight commit files.\r\n\r\n### Issue:\r\n`0.7.0` throw exception `Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Positive number of partitions required` while\r\n`0.9.0-SNAPSHOT`(latest master branch) adds `java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present in Option` on top of it when hudi tries to archive replace commit files(`COMPLETED`, `REQUESTED` and `INFLIGHT`)\r\n\r\nPlease checkout issue https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2707 and ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1740 for further information about the above 2 exceptions. \r\n\r\nThe inner causes are somewhat sophisticated, and I've tried my best to understand them and applied the fix for it, instead of giving it a one-line tricky fix or patch and see errors gone. Of course, the approaches I am taking are open to discussions. \r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n1. `Positive number of partitions required` error is easier to be fixed where we just have to filter out empty `partitionToReplaceFileIds` for `COMPLETED` replace commit files within `ReplaceArchivalHelper.java`.\r\n2.  `java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present in Option` is much more complicated and it happened due to a call to `ClusteringUtils.getRequestedReplaceMetadata()` against _both_ `REQUESTED` and `INFLIGHT` commit files for retrieving their meta body. Now, I get the idea that we are encouraged to use existing utils classes for code reuse. However, a closer inspection upon `getRequestedReplaceMetadata` shows that clustering feature retrieves the meta for `INFLIGHT` commit file through a `REQUESTED` instant. Although this is _not_ fundamentally wrong since there is no \"clustering plan\" for both `REQUESTED` and `INFLIGHT` replace commit files so the outcome is the same for both, as it is also being pointed out in the comment within `getRequestedReplaceMetadata`. However, since `REQUESTED` instant is empty(there is a corresponding [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1739) for it), it generates an `Option.empty()` which is being fetched by `.get()` later which triggered the `NoSuchElementException`. What's more, it _loses_ information in `INFLIGHT` commit file when fetching via `REQUESTED` instant and so we observed in the following screenshot that:\r\n<img width=\"1037\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-07 at 2 09 07\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754011/113918516-7e937a80-981d-11eb-84b6-e2c4bec2c3b1.png\">\r\n\r\nThis does not make sense to me when we pretty much _abuse_ the `REQUESTED` concept to deal with `INFLIGHT` with `REQUESTED` itself being empty. I've taken the approach to define an extra field(placeholder) for `INFLIGHT` and reuse the `HoodieCommitMetadata` for deserializing `INFLIGHT` since they share the same structure where `COMPLETED` replace commit extends `HoodieCommitMetadata` for the extra `partitionToReplaceFileIds` field. Now, here's what I gained after adopting this strategy:\r\n<img width=\"1065\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-08 at 3 01 51\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754011/113919657-cff03980-981e-11eb-928e-65c719d15ca5.png\">\r\n\r\n### The overall outcome after the fix on latest master branch:\r\n<img width=\"924\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-08 at 3 04 29\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754011/113919768-ee563500-981e-11eb-80e8-fe62ba868709.png\">\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is anything I am missing.  :)\r\n\r\n_The simplest solution to the 2nd issue is to actually having `ClusteringUtils.getRequestedReplaceMetadata` return `Option.of(new HoodieRequestedReplaceMetadata())` upon retrieving the empty `REQUESTED` replace commit file for both `REQUESTED` and `INFLIGHT`. I didn't choose to fix the problem this way fearing it's basically altering the inappropriate approach by giving it a bandage and stopping the bleeding._\r\n\r\n\r\n## Update: Attaching testing evidence for both insert_overwrite_table and upsert(with clustering) cases. \r\n_Reason for testing clustering: clustering generates replace commit files as well._\r\n\r\nBuild and running Hudi

pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently the HoodieKey and HoodieRecordLocation do not implement the setters for the POJO member, the Flink TypeExtractor actually needs the setters for POJO SE/DE instead of generic type, the POJO SE/DE is more efficient.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd setter to HoodieKey and HoodieRecordLocation to have better SE/DE performance for Flink \r\nAdd no arg constructor for HoodieKey and HoodieRecordLocation \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nQuick start in hudi has a statically defined schema. But it would be nice for users to try our their own schema with QuickStart. This patch adds such capability. User just need to provide toString representation of avroSchema and record key and the rest is taken care of(data generation, etc) by the datagen tool.\r\n\r\nadditional steps in Quick start to try out custom schema\r\n```\r\nval userSchema = // toString() of an avro schema\r\n// ensure schema has the field for record key. partition path is added internally by the datagen tool and so not required to be part of the userSchema. As of now, only SimpleKeyGenerator is supported for both record key and partition path and partitionpath field is hardcoded. \r\n\r\ndataGen.instantiateSchema(userSchema, \"rowKey\") // replace \"rowKey\" with the field for record key\r\n```\r\nSample run book: https://gist.github.com/nsivabalan/f47805e00996735a054d324a67d4296c\r\n\r\nThis patch adds dependency to io.confluent.avro:avro-random-generator to assist in generating random data for a given avro schema. Dependency is added to hudi-spark-bundle which needs discussion whether we need to keep it in this bundle or move it to a test module. But w/ test module, users will have to build locally before they can try it out. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Added support to test QuickStart w/ a custom avro schema. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added test to TestQuickstartUtils.\r\n- Also, tested Quick start for inserts, updates and deletes.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor Union schema types, avro expects \"null\" to be first entry for null to be considered as default value. But since Hudi leverages SchemaConverters.toAvroType(...) from org.apache.spark:spark-avro_* library, structType to avro results in \"null\" being 2nd entry for UNION type schemas. Also, there is no default value set in this avro schema thus generated. This patch fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes simple schema evolution w/ MOR tables. adding new columns was failing if not for this patch.\r\n\r\nFor eg:\r\nif incoming structType is\r\nStructType(StructField(rowId,StringType,true), StructField(partitionId,StringType,true), StructField(preComb,LongType,true), StructField(name,StringType,true))\r\n\r\nGenerated avro scheme if not for this patch:\r\n{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"hudi_trips_cow_record\",\"namespace\":\"hoodie.hudi_trips_cow\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"rowId\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]},{\"name\":\"partitionId\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]},{\"name\":\"preComb\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]},{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]}]}\r\n\r\nNote that \"null\" is 2nd entry in UNIONs and there is no default set.\r\n\r\nGenerated avro schema with this patch:\r\n{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"hudi_trips_cow_record\",\"namespace\":\"hoodie.hudi_trips_cow\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"rowId\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"partitionId\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"preComb\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"long\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"newField\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null}]}\r\n\r\nNote that default value is null and not null in string format. So, this should work for other data types as well(not just strings). Default value of null is allowed only if null is the first entry in UNION for a given schema field.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixing struct type to avro schema conversion to fix null as first entry in UNION schema types and adds default values for the same.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for convertor function and functional test for schema evolution in HoodieSparkSqlWriterSuite.\r\nTested writing and reading from MOR with evolved schema from spark-shell successfully.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [x] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR (Not required)\r\n       \r\n - [x] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.

Union schema types, avro expects \"null\" to be first entry for null to be considered as default value. But since Hudi leverages SchemaConverters.toAvroType(...) from org.apache.spark:spark-avro_* library, structType to avro results in \"null\" being 2nd entry for UNION type schemas. Also, there is no default value set in this avro schema thus generated.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor Union schema types, avro expects \"null\" to be first entry for null to be considered as default value. But since Hudi leverages SchemaConverters.toAvroType(...) from org.apache.spark:spark-avro_* library, structType to avro results in \"null\" being 2nd entry for UNION type schemas. Also, there is no default value set in this avro schema thus generated. This patch fixes this issue. \r\n\r\nThis also fixes simple schema evolution w/ MOR tables. adding new columns was failing if not for this patch. \r\n\r\nFor eg: \r\nif incoming structType is \r\nStructType(StructField(rowId,StringType,true), StructField(partitionId,StringType,true), StructField(preComb,LongType,true), StructField(name,StringType,true))\r\n\r\nGenerated avro scheme if not for this patch:\r\n{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"hudi_trips_cow_record\",\"namespace\":\"hoodie.hudi_trips_cow\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"rowId\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]},{\"name\":\"partitionId\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]},{\"name\":\"preComb\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]},{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":[\"string\",\"null\"]}]}\r\n\r\nNote that \"null\" is 2nd entry in UNIONs and there is no default set.\r\n\r\nGenerated avro schema with this patch:\r\n{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"hudi_trips_cow_record\",\"namespace\":\"hoodie.hudi_trips_cow\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"rowId\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"partitionId\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"preComb\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"long\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null},{\"name\":\"newField\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"string\"],\"default\":null}]}\r\n\r\nNote that default value is null and not null in string format. So, this should work for other data types as well(not just strings). Default value of null is allowed only if null is the first entry in UNION for a given schema field. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Fixing struct type to avro schema conversion to fix null as first entry in UNION schema types and adds default values for the same. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added tests to HoodieSparkSqlWriterSuite // New test added fails if not for the fix in source code for MOR table and succeeds w/ the fix. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe current SQLQuery based transformer is limited in functionality, you can't pass multiple Spark SQL statements separated by a semicolon which is necessary if your transformation is complex.\r\n\r\nThis pull-request adds a new SQLFileBasedTransformer which takes a Spark SQL file as input with multiple Spark SQL statements to support complex transformation logic and applies the transformation to the delta streamer payload.\r\n\r\nJira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1743\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Adds Spark SQL

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request removes hardcoded file format `parquet` from tests, which helps to integrate different base file formats (eg. ORC) in the future.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Use `HoodieTableConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_FILE_FORMAT` as the base file format for creating file paths and for initializing HoodieTableMetaClient\r\n- Read file format from a HoodieTable or a HoodieTableMetaClient wherever possible\r\n- Introduce a layer of abstraction for data file utility functions to remove hardcoded `ParquetUtils.*` (useful for future integration with ORC)\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAll existing tests should work and pass.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes,
