feel like the non-trivial refactoring deserves its own commit, if only for ease of review in this pull request.\r\n\r\nMy inexperience with `Mockito` is showing through and I got a little carried away in the `RegionDescriptionJUnitTest`.  I don't know if the `spy` on its consumption in `DescribeRegionCommand` is beyond the scope of a reasonable JUnit and/or if we have (or should have) proper coverage of that in wider-scope tests.  I don't really like how I dug into the command output JSON.  So on the one hand, I don't really like those tests and could see them getting deleted.  But on the other hand, it is more test coverage in the cheap JUnit category.
