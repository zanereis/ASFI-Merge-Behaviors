What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are a lot of mainstream databases support regex function `REGEXP_LIKE`.\r\nCurrently, Spark supports `RLike` and we just need add a new alias

modifications**\r\n\r\n1. Because test case named `check outputs of expression examples` in ExpressionInfoSuite executes the example SQL of built-in function, so the below SQL be executed:\r\n`SELECT '%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John' regexp_like '%SystemDrive%\\\\Users.*'`\r\nBut Spark SQL not supports this syntax yet.\r\n2. Another reason: `SELECT '%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John' _FUNC_ '%SystemDrive%\\\\Users.*';`  is an SQL syntax, not the usecase for function `RLike`.\r\nAs the above reason, this PR changes the example SQL of `RLike`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nMake the behavior of Spark SQL consistent with mainstream

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark allows calls to `count` even for non parameterless aggregate function. For example, the following query actually works:\r\n`SELECT count() FROM tenk1;`\r\nOn the other hand, mainstream databases will throw an error.\r\n**Oracle**\r\n`> ORA-00909: invalid number of arguments`\r\n**PgSQL**\r\n`ERROR:  count(*) must be used to call a parameterless aggregate function`\r\n**MySQL**\r\n`> 1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ')`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix a bug so that consistent with mainstream databases.\r\nThere is an example query output with/without this fix.\r\n`SELECT count() FROM testData;`\r\nThe output before this fix:\r\n`0`\r\nThe output after this fix:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException\r\ncannot resolve 'count()' due to data type mismatch: count requires at least one argument.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nIf not specify parameter for `count`, will throw an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-30T03:05:40Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T09:25:12Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T08:04:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95bebe9475fed4f935febf02fa7540879b191161","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0357634f661cc9457620fe3e3b0f6b6d69e462b1","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-28646","ref":"SPARK-28646","sha":"0357634f661cc9457620fe3e3b0f6b6d69e462b1","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Recognize `null` while parsing partition specs, and put `null` instead of `\"null\"` as partition values.\r\n2. For V1 catalog: replace `null` by `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`.\r\n3. For V2 catalogs: pass `null` AS IS, and let catalog implementations to decide how to handle `null`s as partition values in spec.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `null` in partition specs is recognized as the `\"null\"` string which could lead to incorrect results, for example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl5 (col1 INT, p1 STRING) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p1);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO TABLE tbl5 PARTITION (p1 = null) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT isnull(p1) FROM tbl5;\r\nfalse\r\n```\r\nEven we inserted a row to the partition with the `null` value, **the resulted table doesn't contain `null`**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT isnull(p1) FROM tbl5;\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

A new example is needed to fix this issue. \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80 \r\nhttp://oeis.org/wiki/Pi#Decimal_expansion_of_.CF.80.E2.80.8A2\r\nhttps://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiFormulas.html\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9453471/100529357-97b75b00-319b-11eb-8e46-78ea845db567.png)\r\n\r\nThis new example calculates pi using a partial sum of series that implements the formula shown in the attached image.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it provides an additional example python script (series-pi.py) to calculate pi. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe script accepts two optional command-line parameters. The first parameter specifies the number of terms to use to approximate pi. The second parameter specifies the number of Spark partitions to use to calculate the result.\r\n\r\nThe script was run multiple times with 10 million terms, 100 million terms, 500 million terms and 1 billion terms each as the value of the first parameter. The resulting approximate value for pi was verified against the published/known approximation (https://oeis.org/A000796).\r\nTwo things were noted and verified:\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPerform partition spec normalization in `ShowTablesCommand` according to the table schema before getting partitions from the catalog. The normalization via `PartitioningUtils.normalizePartitionSpec()` adjusts the column names in partition specification, w.r.t. the real partition column names and case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEven when `spark.sql.caseSensitive` is `false` which is the default value, v1 `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` is case sensitive:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (price int, qty int, year int, month int)\r\n         > USING parquet\r\n         > partitioned by (year, month);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1) SELECT 1, 1;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl1' PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\nError in query: Partition spec is invalid. The spec (YEAR, Month) must match the partition spec (year, month) defined in table '`default`.`tbl1`';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` command respects the SQL config. And for example above, it returns correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl1' PARTITION(YEAR = 2015, Month = 1);\r\ndefault\ttbl1\tfalse\tPartition Values: [year=2015, month=1]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/spark-warehouse/tbl1/year=2015/month=1\r\nSerde Library: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe\r\nInputFormat:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we will kill the executor when hitting a fatal error. However, if the fatal error is wrapped by another exception, such as\r\n- java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException, com.google.common.util.concurrent.UncheckedExecutionException, com.google.common.util.concurrent.ExecutionError when using Guava cache or Java thread pool.\r\n- SparkException thrown from https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/cf98a761de677c733f3c33230e1c63ddb785d5c5/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileFormatWriter.scala#L231 or https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/cf98a761de677c733f3c33230e1c63ddb785d5c5/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileFormatWriter.scala#L296\r\n\r\nWe will still keep the executor running. Fatal errors are usually unrecoverable (such as OutOfMemoryError), some components may be in a broken state when hitting a fatal error and it's hard to predicate the behaviors of a broken component. Hence, it's better to detect the nested fatal error as well and kill the executor. Then we can rely on Spark's fault tolerance to recover.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFatal errors are usually unrecoverable (such as OutOfMemoryError), some components may be in a broken state when hitting a fatal error and it's hard to predicate the behaviors of a broken component. Hence, it's better to detect the nested fatal error as well and kill the executor. Then we can rely on Spark's fault tolerance to recover.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYep. There is a slight internal behavior change on when to kill an executor. We will kill the executor when detecting a nested fatal error in the exception chain. `spark.executor.killOnFatalError.depth` is added to allow users to turn off this change if the slight behavior change impacts them.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new method `Executor.isFatalError` is tested by

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to use classifier attribute to construct artifact path instead of type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`resolveDependencyPaths` now takes artifact type to decide to add \"-tests\" postfix. However, the path pattern of ivy in `resolveMavenCoordinates` is `[organization]_[artifact][revision](-[classifier]).[ext]`. We should use classifier instead of type to construct file path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix some \"hardcoded\" API urls in Web UI.\r\nMore specifically, we avoid the use of `location.origin` when constructing URLs for internal API calls within the JavaScript.\r\nInstead, we use `apiRoot` global variable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOn one hand, it allows us to build relative URLs. On the other hand, `apiRoot` reflects the Spark property `spark.ui.proxyBase` which can be set to change the root path of the Web UI.\r\n\r\nIf `spark.ui.proxyBase` is actually set, original URLs become incorrect, and we end up with an executors blank page.\r\nI encounter this bug when accessing the Web UI behind a proxy (in my case a Kubernetes Ingress).\r\n\r\nSee the following link for more context:\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/issues/57#issuecomment-699163115\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, as all the changes introduced are in the JavaScript for the Web UI.\r\n\r\n### How the changes have been tested ?\r\nI modified/debugged the JavaScript as in the commit with the help of the developer tools in Google Chrome, while accessing the Web UI of my Spark app behind my k8s ingress.","created_at":"2020-11-27T14:04:59Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T13:14:08Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T10:32:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5584e9b114e1927cef5561c723c4a85e398d671e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are some differences between Spark CSV, opencsv and commons-csv, the typical case are described in SPARK-33566, When there are both unescaped quotes and unescaped qualifier in value,  the results of parsing are different. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the difference is Spark use `STOP_AT_DELIMITER` as default `UnescapedQuoteHandling` to build `CsvParser` and it not configurable.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, opencsv and commons-csv use the parsing mechanism similar to `STOP_AT_CLOSING_QUOTE ` by default.\r\n\r\nSo this pr make `unescapedQuoteHandling` option configurable to get the same parsing result as opencsv and commons-csv.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake unescapedQuoteHandling option configurable when read CSV to make parsing more flexible。\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Add a new case similar to that described in SPARK-33566\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-26T14:50:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T03:45:19Z","closed_at":"2020-11-27T06:47:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"008f6dbfeb62371135eaec5984c09cc2a19e9fdd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes mariadb_docker_entrypoint.sh to set the proper version automatically for mariadb-plugin-gssapi-server.\r\nThe proper version is based on the one of mariadb-server.\r\nAlso, this PR enables to use arbitrary docker image by setting the environment variable `MARIADB_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor `MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite`, the version of `mariadb-plugin-gssapi-server` is currently set to `10.5.5` in `mariadb_docker_entrypoint.sh` but it's no longer available in the official apt repository and `MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite` doesn't pass for now.\r\nIt seems that only the most recent three versions are available for each major version and they are `10.5.6`, `10.5.7` and `10.5.8` for now.\r\nFurther, the release cycle of MariaDB seems to be very rapid (1 ~ 2 months) so I don't think it's a good idea to set to an specific version for `mariadb-plugin-gssapi-server`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed that `MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite` passes with the following commands.\r\n```\r\n$  build/sbt -Pdocker-integration-tests -Phive -Phive-thriftserver package \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite\"\r\n```\r\nIn this case, we can see what version of `mariadb-plugin-gssapi-server` is going to be installed in the following container log message.\r\n```\r\nInstalling mariadb-plugin-gssapi-server=1:10.5.8+maria~focal\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, we can set MARIADB_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME for a specific version of MariaDB.\r\n```\r\n$ MARIADB_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=mariadb:10.5.6 build/sbt -Pdocker-integration-tests -Phive -Phive-thriftserver package \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInstalling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Remove the method `listPartitionIdentifiers()` from the `SupportsPartitionManagement` interface. The method lists partitions by ident prefix.\r\n2. Rename `listPartitionByNames()` to `listPartitionIdentifiers()`.\r\n3. Re-implement the default method `partitionExists()` using new method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nGetting partitions by ident prefix only is not used, and it can be removed to improve code maintenance. Also this makes the `SupportsPartitionManagement` interface cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up to #29855 according to the [comments](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29855/files#r505536514)\r\nIn this PR, the following changes are made:\r\n\r\n1. A new `BlockPushingListener` interface is created specifically for block push, and the existing `BlockFetchingListener` interface is left backward compatible. These 2 interfaces are unified under `BlockTransferListener` to enable code reuse.\r\n2. `RetryingBlockFetcher`, `BlockFetchStarter`, and `RetryingBlockFetchListener` are renamed to `RetryingBlockTransferor`, `BlockTransferStarter`, and `RetryingBlockTransferListener` respectively. This makes their names more generic to be reused across both block fetch and push.\r\n3. Comments in `OneForOneBlockPusher` are further clarified to better explain how we handle retries for block push.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make code cleaner without sacrificing backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2020-11-26T04:07:23Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T06:11:38Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T00:48:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47e684bdebc16aa68bae31985d68378054c8cc93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ada02de797758a06377f75b0bf173a5bda1efa9a","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-32915-followup","ref":"SPARK-32915-followup","sha":"ada02de797758a06377f75b0bf173a5bda1efa9a","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently in Spark one could redefine a window. For instance:\r\n\r\n`select count(*) OVER w FROM tenk1 WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY unique1), w AS (ORDER BY unique1);`\r\nThe window `w` is defined two times. In PgSQL, on the other hand, a thrown will happen:\r\n\r\n`ERROR:  window \"w\" is already defined`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current implement gives the following window definitions a higher priority. But it wasn't Spark's intention and users can't know from any document of Spark.\r\nThis PR fixes the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nThere is an example query output with/without this fix.\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n    employee_name,\r\n    salary,\r\n    first_value(employee_name) OVER w highest_salary,\r\n    nth_value(employee_name, 2) OVER w

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32295 added in an optimization to insert a filter for not null and size > 0 when using inner explode/inline. This is fine in most cases but the extra filter is not needed if the explode is with a create array and not using Literals (it already handles LIterals).  When this happens you know that the values aren't null and it has a size.  It already handles the empty array.\r\n\r\nThe not null check is already optimized out because Createarray and createMap are not nullable, that leaves the size > 0 check. To handle that this PR makes it so that the size > 0 check gets optimized in ConstantFolding to be the size of the children in the array or map.  That makes it a literal and then makes it ultimately be optimized out.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nremove unneeded filter\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests added and manually tested various

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Remove the fixed width style of class `container-fluid-div`. So that the UI looks clean when the text is long.\r\n2. Add one space between a checkbox and the text on the right side, which is consistent with the stage page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe width of class `container-fluid-div` is set as 200px after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21688 . This makes the checkbox in the executor page messy.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/100242069-3bc5ab80-2ee9-11eb-8c7d-96c221398fee.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should remove the width limit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManual test.\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/100257802-2f4a4e80-2efb-11eb-9eb0-92d6988ad14b.png)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-25T16:50:14Z","updated_at":"2020-11-26T04:01:15Z","closed_at":"2020-11-26T01:19:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d462324fa8b47cbcbf8be5f3a84d1bc74cb6d4d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to support subexpression elimination for interpreted predicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to interpreted projection, there are use cases when codegen predicate is not able to work, e.g. too complex schema, non-codegen expression, etc. When there are frequently occurring expressions (subexpressions) among predicate expression, the performance is quite bad as we need to re-compute same expressions. We should be able to support subexpression elimination for interpreted predicate like interpreted projection.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this doesn't change user behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark.","created_at":"2020-11-25T09:14:00Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:26Z","closed_at":"2020-11-25T16:55:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e6a2d374b505283a4fafdb0c8c43e61af4a93c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/56c09cab1180a7ee676e69e435aed555fb98e501","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-33540","ref":"SPARK-33540","sha":"56c09cab1180a7ee676e69e435aed555fb98e501","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an AQE issue where local shuffle reader, partition coalescing, or skew join optimization can be mistakenly applied to a shuffle introduced by repartition or a regular shuffle that logically replaces a repartition shuffle.\r\nThe proposed solution checks for the presence of any repartition shuffle and filters out not applicable optimization rules for the final stage in an AQE plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout the change, the output of a repartition query may not be correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove SQL configuration spark.sql.legacy.allowCastNumericToTimestamp\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master branch, there is a new configuration `spark.sql.legacy.allowCastNumericToTimestamp` which controls whether to cast Numeric types to Timestamp or not. The default value is true.\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30260, the type conversion between Timestamp type and Numeric type is disallowed in ANSI mode. So, we don't need to a separate configuration `spark.sql.legacy.allowCastNumericToTimestamp` for disallowing the conversion. Users just need to set `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` for the behavior.\r\n\r\nAs the configuration is not in any released yet, we should remove the configuration to make things simpler.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, since the configuration is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support storage migration to the fallback storage like cloud storage (`S3`) during worker decommission for the corner cases where the exceptions occur or there is no live peer left.\r\n\r\nAlthough this PR focuses on cloud storage like `S3` which has a TTL feature in order to simplify Spark's logic, we can use alternative fallback storages like HDFS/NFS(EFS) if the user provides a clean-up mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, storage migration is not possible when there is no available executor. For example, when there is one executor, the executor cannot perform storage migration because it has no peer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis replaces Spark session and `DataSourceV2Relation` in V2 write plans by replacing them with a callback `afterWrite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPer discussion in #30429, it's better to not pass Spark session and `DataSourceV2Relation` through Spark plans. Instead we can use a callback which makes the interface cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2020-11-24T20:24:59Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T17:59:21Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T04:51:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8d798aa7379e92b3512860fdde274b582777ae9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/98e9edeabc7df0f5b01c8f8cd9c886134bd0d85a","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-33492-followup","ref":"SPARK-33492-followup","sha":"98e9edeabc7df0f5b01c8f8cd9c886134bd0d85a","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `SHOW COLUMNS` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `SHOW COLUMNS` is not yet supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo use `UnresolvedTableOrView` for table/view resolution. Note that `ShowColumnsCommand` internally resolves to a temp view first, so there is no resolution behavior change with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-11-24T19:44:16Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T03:08:40Z","closed_at":"2020-11-25T03:04:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb76e783eed47ca5a79d9b37c6208b299bf0a23c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30490/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30490/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30490/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9b71262a7d9a76dc495f52cc221b52b903ba8af","head":{"label":"imback82:show_columns","ref":"show_columns","sha":"e9b71262a7d9a76dc495f52cc221b52b903ba8af","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to improve the performance of CollectLimitExec#executeToIterator. \r\nThe improvement way is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Create a ShuffledRowRDD containing the first parent partition.\r\n2. Collect rows of this ShuffledRowRDD  to driver\r\n3. If collected rows is less than limit number, then create the next ShuffledRowRDD with serveral following parent partitions. The number of parent partitions is calculated the same way as SparkPlan#executeTake.\r\n4. Repeat 2~3 until total collected rows reaches limit number or all  parent partitions have been computed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, when invoking CollectLimitExec#executeToIterator, a single-partition ShuffledRowRDD containg all  parent partitions is created. Spark will compute all these partitions to get the result.\r\nBut in most cases, computing the first few partitions is enought to get the result, which takes much less time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-24T16:53:24Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T00:48:01Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T00:48:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac5dcc522ff0289ae56a7b18fa0cac7076cf6e91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/399fde2002f1b40a547bea93c5170554685ebd59","head":{"label":"hammertank:SPARK-33531","ref":"SPARK-33531","sha":"399fde2002f1b40a547bea93c5170554685ebd59","user":{"login":"hammertank","id":6144099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6144099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank","html_url":"https://github.com/hammertank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315619234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU2MTkyMzQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"hammertank/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hammertank","id":6144099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6144099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank","html_url":"https://github.com/hammertank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammertank/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hammertank/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, `join()` uses `withPlan(logicalPlan)` for convenient to call some Dataset functions. But it leads to the `dataset_id` inconsistent between the `logicalPlan` and the original `Dataset`(because `withPlan(logicalPlan)` will create a new Dataset with the new id and reset the `dataset_id` with the new id of the `logicalPlan`). As a result, it breaks the rule `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we propose to drop the usage of `withPlan` but use the `logicalPlan` directly so its `dataset_id` doesn't change.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also removes related metadata (`DATASET_ID_KEY`,  `COL_POS_KEY`) when an `Alias` tries to construct its own metadata. Because the `Alias` is no longer a reference column after converting to an `Attribute`.  To achieve that, we add a new field, `deniedMetadataKeys`, to indicate the metadata that needs to be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor the query below, it returns the wrong result while it should throws ambiguous self join exception instead:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval emp1 = Seq[TestData](\r\n  TestData(1, \"sales\"),\r\n  TestData(2, \"personnel\"),\r\n  TestData(3, \"develop\"),\r\n  TestData(4, \"IT\")).toDS()\r\nval emp2 = Seq[TestData](\r\n  TestData(1, \"sales\"),\r\n  TestData(2, \"personnel\"),\r\n  TestData(3, \"develop\")).toDS()\r\nval emp3 = emp1.join(emp2, emp1(\"key\") === emp2(\"key\")).select(emp1(\"*\"))\r\nemp1.join(emp3, emp1.col(\"key\") === emp3.col(\"key\"), \"left_outer\")\r\n  .select(emp1.col(\"*\"), emp3.col(\"key\").as(\"e2\")).show()\r\n\r\n// wrong result\r\n+---+---------+---+\r\n|key|    value| e2|\r\n+---+---------+---+\r\n|  1|    sales|  1|\r\n|  2|personnel|  2|\r\n|  3|  develop|  3|\r\n|  4|       IT|  4|\r\n+---+---------+---+\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes the wrong behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users hit the exception instead of the wrong result after this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit

cluster modes too and adds `spark.archives` configuration.\r\n-  After this PR, PySpark users can leverage Conda to ship Python packages together as below:\r\n    ```python\r\n    conda create -y -n pyspark_env -c conda-forge pyarrow==2.0.0 pandas==1.1.4 conda-pack==0.5.0\r\n    conda activate pyspark_env\r\n    conda pack -f -o pyspark_env.tar.gz\r\n    PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=python PYSPARK_PYTHON=./environment/bin/python pyspark --archives pyspark_env.tar.gz#environment\r\n   ```\r\n- Issue a warning that undocumented and hidden behavior of partial archive handling in `spark.files` / `SparkContext.addFile` will be deprecated, and users can use `spark.archives` and `SparkContext.addArchive`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add Spark's native `--archives` in Spark submit, and `spark.archives` configuration. Currently, both are supported only in Yarn mode:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-submit --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptions:\r\n...\r\n Spark on YARN only:\r\n  --queue QUEUE_NAME          The YARN queue to submit to (Default: \"default\").\r\n  --archives ARCHIVES         Comma separated list of archives to be extracted into the\r\n                              working directory of each executor.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `archives` feature is useful often when you have to ship a directory and unpack into executors. One example is native libraries to use e.g. JNI. Another example is to ship Python packages together by Conda environment.\r\n\r\nEspecially for Conda, PySpark currently does not have a nice way to ship a package that works in general, please see also https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/python_packaging.html#using-zipped-virtual-environment (PySpark new documentation demo for 3.1.0).\r\n\r\nThe neatest way is arguably to use Conda environment by shipping zipped Conda environment but this is currently dependent on this archive feature. NOTE that we are able to use `spark.files` by relying on its undocumented behaviour that untars `tar.gz` but I don't think we should document such ways and promote people to more rely on it.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that this PR does not target to add the feature parity of `spark.files.overwrite`, `spark.files.useFetchCache`, etc. yet. I documented that this is an experimental feature as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo complete the feature parity, and to provide a better support of shipping Python libraries together with Conda env.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this makes `--archives` works in Spark instead of Yarn-only, and adds a new configuration `spark.archives`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added unittests. Also, manually tested in standalone cluster, local-cluster, and local modes.","created_at":"2020-11-24T14:20:05Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:06Z","closed_at":"2020-12-01T04:43:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1be0422351956f6fbd383094ea032585285725a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30486/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30486/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30486/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e35e94cad2888c98e03feb391a8dfcca8afa365c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:native-archive","ref":"native-archive","sha":"e35e94cad2888c98e03feb391a8dfcca8afa365c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main purpose of this pr is to introduce the File Meta Cache mechanism for Spark SQL and the basic File Meta Cache implementation for Parquet is provided at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr as follows:\r\n\r\n- Defined a `FileMetaCacheManager` to cache the mapping `FileMetaKey` to `FileMeta`. The `FileMetaKey` is the cache key, `equals` is determined by the file path by default. The `FileMeta` used to represent the cache value and It is generated by the  `FileMetaKey#getFileMeta `  method. \r\n\r\n- Currently, the `FileMetaCacheManager` supports a simple cache expiration elimination mechanism, and the expiration time is determined by the new config  `FILE_META_CACHE_TTL_SINCE_LAST_ACCESS `\r\n\r\n- For Parquet file format, this pr added `ParquetFileMetaKey ` and `ParquetFileMeta` to cache Parquet file Footer and the Footer cache can be used by Vectorized read scene both in DS API V1 and V2, the feature will be enabled when `FILE_META_CACHE_PARQUET_ENABLED ` is true\r\n\r\nCurrently, the file meta cache mechanism cannot be used by `RowBasedReader`, and it needs the completion of [PARQUET-1965](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1965) for further support.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport Parquet datasource use File Meta Cache mechanism to reduce the times of metadata reads multiple queries are performed on the same dataset. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd 3 new config:\r\n\r\n- `FILE_META_CACHE_PARQUET_ENABLED(spark.sql.fileMetaCache.parquet.enabled)` to indicate if enable parquet file meta cache mechanism\r\n- `FILE_META_CACHE_TTL_SINCE_LAST_ACCESS(spark.sql.fileMetaCache.ttlSinceLastAccess)` to represent Time-to-live for file metadata cache entry after last access, the unit is seconds.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Add new test suites to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Extract the code for partition values casting from DSv1 to the common place `sql.util.PartitioningUtils` - the method `castPartitionValues()`.\r\n2. Re-use `castPartitionValues()` from DSv2 resolver of partition specs - `ResolvePartitionSpec`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo have the same behavior as DSv1 which interprets `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__` as `NULL`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl11 (id int, part0 string) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (part0);\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl11 ADD PARTITION (part0 = '__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__');\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl11 PARTITION (part0='__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__') SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl11;\r\n1\tNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test to `AlterTablePartitionV2SQLSuite`.","created_at":"2020-11-24T09:50:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:03:42Z","closed_at":"2020-12-29T13:51:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81fe166fdab4ea4a0d63f8c82ddd011865d607e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/26b83a101f39c8d0878c96b6ffd228e040169c8b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:dsv2-default-hive-partition","ref":"dsv2-default-hive-partition","sha":"26b83a101f39c8d0878c96b6ffd228e040169c8b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR add a new config `spark.sql.thriftServer.forceCancel` to give user a way to interrupt task when cancel statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter [#29933](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29933), we support cancel query if timeout, but the default behavior of `SparkContext.cancelJobGroups` won't interrupt task and just let task finish by itself. In some case it's dangerous, e.g., data skew or exists a heavily shuffle. A task will hold in a long time after do cancel and the resource will not release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2020-11-24T09:19:43Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T12:08:46Z","closed_at":"2020-12-11T15:52:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfdb858f0af2db49994c85da68ad804c1c8f1346","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0466c0cc3bb75a0315c168e4612ea044e83ce50b","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-33526","ref":"SPARK-33526","sha":"0466c0cc3bb75a0315c168e4612ea044e83ce50b","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is one of the patches for SPIP SPARK-30602 for push-based shuffle.\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n\r\n- Introduce `MergeStatus` which tracks the partition level metadata for a merged shuffle partition in the Spark driver\r\n- Unify `MergeStatus` and `MapStatus` under a single trait to allow code reusing inside `MapOutputTracker`\r\n- Extend `MapOutputTracker` to support registering / unregistering `MergeStatus`, calculate preferred locations for a shuffle taking into consideration of merged shuffle partitions, and serving reducer requests for block fetching locations with merged shuffle partitions.\r\n\r\nThe added APIs in `MapOutputTracker` will be used by `DAGScheduler` in SPARK-32920 and by `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` in SPARK-32922\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefer to SPARK-30602\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Min Shen mshen@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Chandni Singh chsingh@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Venkata Sowrirajan

'SHOW CREATE TABLE' expects a table or permanent view.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, if an identifier is not resolved, the following exception message is currently used:\r\n```\r\nTable or view not found: t\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, the message will be:\r\n```\r\nTable or permanent view not found for 'SHOW CREATE TABLE': t\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nTable or view not found for 'ANALYZE TABLE ... FOR COLUMNS ...': t\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to changes the resolver of partition specs used in V2 `ALTER TABLE .. ADD/DROP PARTITION` (at the moment), and re-use `CAST` in conversion partition values to desired types according to the partition schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the resolver of V2 partition specs supports just a few types:

types like date/timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSkip files if they are binary or very large to fit the configMap's max size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nConfig map cannot hold binary files and there is also a limit on how much data a configMap can hold.\r\nThis limit can be configured by the k8s cluster admin. This PR, skips such files (with a warning) instead of failing with weird runtime errors.\r\nIf such files are not skipped, then it would result in mount errors or encoding errors (if binary files are submitted). \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, in simple words avoids possible errors due to negligence (for example, placing a large file or a binary file in SPARK_CONF_DIR) and thus improves user experience.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nmake CrossValidator/TrainValidateSplit/OneVsRest Reader/Writer support Python backend estimator/model\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, pyspark support third-party library to define python backend estimator/evaluator, i.e., estimator that inherit `Estimator` instead of `JavaEstimator`, and only can be used in pyspark.\r\n\r\nCrossValidator and TrainValidateSplit support tuning these python backend estimator,\r\nbut cannot support saving/load, becase CrossValidator and TrainValidateSplit writer implementation is use JavaMLWriter, which require to convert nested estimator and evaluator into java instance.\r\n\r\nOneVsRest saving/load now only support java backend classifier due to similar issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the discussion https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30292#issuecomment-725613417, we planned to apply a new API key for each Spark release. However, it turns that DocSearch supports crawling multiple URLs from one website and filtering by fact key: https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/config-file/#using-regular-expressions\r\n\r\nThanks to the help from @shortcuts, our Spark doc supports multiple version now: https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/2868\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add the fact key in the search script and update the instruction in the comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support filtering Spark documentation search results by the current document version. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark already support `LIKE ANY` syntax, but it will throw `StackOverflowError` if there are many elements(more than 14378 elements). We should implement built-in function for LIKE ANY to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nWhy the stack overflow can happen in the current approach ?\r\nThe current approach uses reduceLeft to connect each `Like(e, p)`, this will lead the the call depth of the thread is too large, causing `StackOverflowError` problems.\r\n\r\nWhy the fix in this PR can avoid the error?\r\nThis PR support built-in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 065f17386d1851d732b4c1badf1ce2e14d0de338, which is not part of any released version. That is, this is an unreleased feature\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI like the concept of Trash, but I think this PR might just resolve a very specific issue by introducing a mechanism without a proper design doc. This could make the usage more complex.\r\n\r\nI think we need to consider the big picture. Trash directory is an important concept. If we decide to introduce it, we should consider all the code paths of Spark SQL that could delete the data, instead of Truncate only. We also need to consider what is the current behavior if the underlying file system does not provide the API `Trash.moveToAppropriateTrash`. Is the exception good? How about the performance when users are using the object store instead of HDFS? Will it impact the GDPR compliance? \r\n\r\nIn sum, I think we should not merge the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29552 without the design doc and implementation plan. That is why I reverted it before the code freeze of Spark 3.1\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nReverted the original commit\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe existing tests.","created_at":"2020-11-23T05:08:39Z","updated_at":"2020-11-23T08:44:37Z","closed_at":"2020-11-23T08:44:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c82ebd8383454c956af245d399fc4721c5aec3ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30463/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30463/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30463/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32a711d5570d301bd90aed677e921ee63038da13","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:revertSpark-32481","ref":"revertSpark-32481","sha":"32a711d5570d301bd90aed677e921ee63038da13","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis follow-up fixes an issue when inserting key/value pairs into `IdentityHashMap` in `SubExprEvaluationRuntime`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe last commits to #30341 follows review comment to use `IdentityHashMap`. Because we leverage `IdentityHashMap` to compare keys in reference, we should not convert expression pairs to Scala map before inserting. Scala map compares keys by equality so we will loss keys with different references. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRun benchmark to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `TRUNCATE TABLE` to use `UnresolvedTable` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `TRUNCATE TABLE` works only with v1 tables, and not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes allow consistent resolution behavior when resolving the table identifier. For example, the following is the current behavior:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 1\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE db\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t using csv AS SELECT 1\")\r\nsql(\"USE db\")\r\nsql(\"TRUNCATE TABLE t\") // Succeeds\r\n```\r\nWith this PR, `TRUNCATE TABLE` above fails with the following:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view not table.; line 1 pos 0\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveTempViews$$anonfun$apply$7.$anonfun$applyOrElse$42(Analyzer.scala:866)\r\n\r\n```\r\n, which is expected since temporary view is resolved first and `TRUNCATE TABLE` doesn't support a temporary view.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `TRUNCATE TABLE` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of table `db.t` in the above scenario.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-11-22T00:31:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T20:22:06Z","closed_at":"2020-11-24T11:07:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0323cd5bdbc4a6cfa43b3865a95fa6b56eb6ac43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27d6f9292b881b615a0806a6d8d856b0d32a33a6","head":{"label":"imback82:truncate_table","ref":"truncate_table","sha":"27d6f9292b881b615a0806a6d8d856b0d32a33a6","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Pre-process partition specs in `ResolvePartitionSpec`, and convert partition names according to the partition schema and the SQL config `spark.sql.caseSensitive`. In the PR, I propose to invoke `normalizePartitionSpec` for that. The function is used in DSv1 commands, so, the behavior will be similar to DSv1.\r\n2. Move `normalizePartitionSpec()` from `sql/core/.../datasources/PartitioningUtils` to `sql/catalyst/.../util/PartitioningUtils` to use it in Catalyst's rule `ResolvePartitionSpec`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDSv1 commands like `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` and `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` respect the SQL config `spark.sql.caseSensitive` while resolving partition specs. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (id bigint, data string) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (id);\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 ADD PARTITION (ID=1);\r\nspark-sql> SHOW PARTITIONS tbl1;\r\nid=1\r\n```\r\nThe same command fails on V2 Table catalog with error:\r\n```\r\nAnalysisException: Partition key ID not exists\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, partition spec resolution works as for DSv1 (without the exception showed above).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `AlterTablePartitionV2SQLSuite`.","created_at":"2020-11-21T20:13:07Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:03:39Z","closed_at":"2020-11-23T09:00:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87da4e8d08927b7ded68cd7a77af33fc12e79a81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/046f0d1a7564a6ca5f2bc6e608c6f771dc4b9df8","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:partition-spec-case-sensitivity","ref":"partition-spec-case-sensitivity","sha":"046f0d1a7564a6ca5f2bc6e608c6f771dc4b9df8","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add new method `listPartitionByNames` to the `SupportsPartitionManagement` interface. It allows to list partitions by partition names and their values.\r\n2. Implement new method in `InMemoryPartitionTable` which is used in DSv2 tests. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the `SupportsPartitionManagement` interface exposes only `listPartitionIdentifiers` which allows to list partitions by partition values. And it requires to specify all values for partition schema fields in the prefix. This restriction does not allow to list partitions by some of partition names (not all of them).\r\n\r\nFor example, the table `tableA` is partitioned by two column `year` and `month`\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE tableA (price int, year int, month int)\r\nUSING _\r\npartitioned by (year, month)\r\n```\r\nand has the following partitions:\r\n```\r\nPARTITION(year = 2015, month = 1)\r\nPARTITION(year = 2015, month = 2)\r\nPARTITION(year = 2016, month = 2)\r\nPARTITION(year = 2016, month = 3)\r\n```\r\nIf we want to list all partitions with `month = 2`, we have to specify `year` for **listPartitionIdentifiers()** which not always possible as we don't know all `year` values in advance. New method **listPartitionByNames()** allows to specify partition values only for `month`, and get two partitions:\r\n```\r\nPARTITION(year = 2015, month = 2)\r\nPARTITION(year = 2016, month = 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite `SupportsPartitionManagementSuite`.","created_at":"2020-11-21T15:11:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:03:38Z","closed_at":"2020-11-25T12:42:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4610d159cb0d20cdcf45cb30ff57e05d8e741b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30452/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30452/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30452/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f20ee8289107f10a65165e4a6dbb69250039efa","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:column-names-listPartitionIdentifiers","ref":"column-names-listPartitionIdentifiers","sha":"3f20ee8289107f10a65165e4a6dbb69250039efa","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-on to PR #30096 which initially added support for printing direct links to the driver stdout/stderr logs from the application report output in `yarn.Client` using the `spark.yarn.includeDriverLogsLink` configuration. That PR made use of the ResourceManager's REST APIs to fetch the necessary information to construct the links. This PR proposes removing the dependency on the REST API, since the new logic is the only place in `yarn.Client` which makes use of this API, and instead leverages the RPC API via `YarnClient`, which brings the code in line with the rest of `yarn.Client`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhile the old logic worked okay when running a Spark application in a \"standard\" environment with full access to Kerberos credentials, it can fail when run in an environment with restricted Kerberos credentials. In our case, this environment is represented by [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/), but it likely affects other job scheduling systems as well. In such an environment, the application has delegation tokens which enabled it to communicate with services such as YARN, but the RM REST API is not typically covered by such delegation tokens (note that although YARN does actually support accessing the RM REST API via a delegation token as documented [here](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceManagerRest.html#Cluster_Delegation_Tokens_API), it is a new feature in alpha phase, and most deployments are likely not retrieving this token today).\r\n\r\nBesides this enhancement, leveraging the `YarnClient` APIs greatly simplifies the processing logic, such as removing all JSON parsing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nVery minimal user-facing changes on top of PR #30096. Basically expands the scope of environments in which that feature will operate correctly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nIn addition to redoing the `spark-submit` testing as mentioned in PR #30096, I also tested this logic in a restricted-credentials environment (Azkaban). It succeeds where the previous logic would fail with a 401

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add a hook method to `addPartitionKey()` of `InMemoryTable` which is called per every row.\r\n2. Override `addPartitionKey()` in `InMemoryPartitionTable`, and add partition key every time when new row is inserted to the table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be able to write unified tests for datasources V1 and V2. Currently, INSERT INTO a V1 table creates partitions but the same doesn't work for the custom catalog `InMemoryPartitionTableCatalog` used in DSv2 tests. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite `DataSourceV2SQLSuite`.","created_at":"2020-11-20T19:21:42Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:03:38Z","closed_at":"2020-11-21T02:41:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a33ab51b5d9f4b05ba90d9f580b8b4ffe8983a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30449/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30449/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30449/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/362e8b86ae18d5833c281717924a778e1108085a","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:insert-into-InMemoryPartitionTable","ref":"insert-into-InMemoryPartitionTable","sha":"362e8b86ae18d5833c281717924a778e1108085a","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport filed EPOCH in the function `extract` and `date_part`, which returns the number of seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00-00`\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM TIMESTAMP'1970-01-02 00:00:00-08');\r\n115200.0\r\n> SELECT DATE_PART('EPOCH', TIMESTAMP'1970-01-01 00:00:01.234-00')\r\n1.234\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this field only works with Date and Timestamp input. It doesn't work with Interval type. In Spark, the number of seconds of `month` /`day` is considered as uncertain in Spark (a month contains 28~31 days, a day contains 23 ~25 hours). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is useful for getting the number of seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00-00`. \r\nPostgreSQL also supports the same field:\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT\r\n\r\nThe other reason is that since casting from TimestampType to Numeric Type is disallowed in ANSI mode, we need to provide a proper solution if a user has to do the casting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new field \"EPOCH\" for datetime function extract/date_part \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please
