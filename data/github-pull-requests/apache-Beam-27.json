the problem was watermark set to Instant.now() at initialization and after finalizing every non zero checkpoint mark.

the following metrics after we insert a batch of rows using BigQuery's InsertAll RPC.\r\n\r\n### 1. `RowsAppendedCount` Counter\r\nTracks the status of BigQuery Rows after the batch of InsertAll RPCs is completed.\r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `RowStatus`: Status of the BigQuery rows after , one of `SUCCESSFUL`, `RETRIED`, `FAILED`\r\n-  `RpcStatus`: Rpc Status\r\n- `TableId`: 'datasets/{ }/tables/{ }' that the rows are sent to.\r\n\r\nRows are updated based on the following criteria.\r\n- Rows that are successfully inserted will have their `RowStatus` set to successful.\r\n- Rows that have to be retried because the RPC failed will have their `RowStatus` set to `RETRIED` and `RpcStatus` set to the failed RPC's status.\r\n- Rows might fail to be inserted even when the `InsertAll` RPC succeeds. These rows will have their `RowStatus` set to `RETRIED` and `RpcStatus` set to `INTERNAL`.\r\n- Rows that fail to be inserted will `RowStatus` set to `RETRIED` and `RpcStatus` set to `INTERNAL`.\r\n\r\n### 2. `RpcRequests` Counter \r\nTracks the Rpc Status of the InsertAll Rpc.\r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `Method`: BigQuery sink method. Will be `STREAMING_INSERTS` for these metrics.\r\n-  `RpcStatus`: Rpc Status\r\n- `TableId`: 'datasets/{ }/tables/{ }' that the rows are sent to.\r\n\r\n### 3. `RpcLatency` Histogram:\r\nTracks the Rpc Latency of the InsertAll Rpc. \r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `Method`: BigQuery sink method. Will be `STREAMING_INSERTS` for these metrics.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#30297\r\n\r\n- if KafkaIO is not used, there is no KafkaIO.Read in the pipeline to run override\r\n- If KafkaIO is used, it should already be declared as an implementation dependency\r\n\r\nThough it is generally not recommended to catch Error (NoClassDefFoundError), I find this may be preferrable to reduce the number of staged artifacts, and also no longer mandate io.confluent repository to submit a pipeline on Dataflow runner.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pull request introduces stress tests for BigQueryIO, designed to assess the performance under various conditions. The stress tests simulate dynamic load increases and evaluate the behavior of BigQueryIO for different write formats and methods.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Added stress tests for BigQueryIO.\r\n- Implemented dynamic load increases over time to simulate varying workloads.\r\n- Introduced configurations for controlling the stress test parameters, such as the number of columns, write method, write format, etc.\r\n- Added support for exporting metrics to _InfluxDB_ or _BigQuery_ based on the configuration parameter.\r\n\r\n**Dynamic load increases over time example:**\r\n![image (2)](https://github.com/apache/beam/assets/17278361/35bad92b-5a85-40b1-bfdb-dca998c81e60)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds Load tests for PubSubIO. There are several configurations depending on the amount of data and the runner where the tests will be executed:\r\n\r\n- **local**: Data volume is 0.2 MB. The test runs on the local machine using the Direct Runner.\r\n- **medium**: Data volume is 10 GB. The test runs on the Dataflow runner.\r\n- **large**: Data volume is 100 GB. The test runs on the Dataflow runner.\r\n\r\nHow to verify the results:\r\n\r\n1. Install Gradle on your local machine.\r\n2. Run the command `gradle :it:google-cloud-platform:PubSubPerformanceTest --tests \"org.apache.beam.it.gcp.pubsub.PubSubIOLT\" -d` from the project root to execute the tests.\r\n3. The tests will pass successfully if all data is processed within a certain amount of time and the processed data matches the expected amount.\r\n4. Additionally, upon running the test, a link for monitoring the job will be displayed in the terminal, providing more detailed information on how much data has been processed and the progress. An example link is: https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/jobs/us-central1/2024-02-13_00_10_16-5567586527775732420?project=apache-beam-testing.\r\n\r\n[Write job

For test of `testCloseVisibleToAwaitCompletionCallerAndProducer` \r\n  * It is flaky due to a race condition.\r\n  * There are two threads running (future and future2). Thread 2 may execute and close the observer before Thread 1 reaching the while loop. This will cause `BeamFnDataInboundObserver.CloseException` thrown at calling `future.get()`.\r\n  * The fix is just to let Thread2 wait a little time so that Thread 1 can reach the infinite while loop before the observer is closed by Thread 2.\r\n  * I was able to reproduce the flake 10/10 prior to the fix, but after that I have tested it about 30 times with no failure.\r\n\r\n* For test `testThreadsAreAddedOnlyAsNeededWithContention`, my attempt is to increase the threshold so we can allow more extra threads being created.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

classes that explicitly inject a `MetricTrackingWindmillServerStub` to take in a Function.\r\nThis will give flexibility in later refactoring as we apply different ways to fetch the data without MetricTrackingWindmillServerStub.\r\nAdd `PersistentStateReadMetricsTracker`, which is similar to `MetricTrackingWindmillServerStub` but allows callers to inject a `GetDataStream` (which is necessary for direct path since the calls need to be appropriately routed) and is streaming engine specific.\r\n\r\nR: @scwhittle \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the max buffering duration for batch processing during JDBC writes is not configurable and defaulted to 200ms. I'm proposing that we add an option to configure this setting to allow for a longer duration period to accumulate batched elements. We've run into an issue where batches are committed too frequently causing many small batches to be written rather than fewer larger batches, and I'm hoping to tweak this setting to allow for the latter.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

zero-values.\r\n\r\nSince this is converted to a proto in the dataflow backend, an empty `DataflowHistogramValue::OutlierStats` is handled gracefully. e.g. when `OutlierStats` is not set, accessing `OutlierStats::UnderflowCount` returns 0 which is the intended value.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

introduce an IsolationChannel class that uses a separate channel per-rpc. As rpcs complete, the channel will be available for subsequent rpcs. This isn't a good idea in general but given we have a few long-lived rpcs in the streaming client.\r\n- use a separate GetDataStream rpc for heartbeats from read requests. This ensures that heartbeats are not delayed by other read requests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
