you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo update the documentation for `DATE_FORMAT`, which is not accurate now. The current function behaviors are:\r\n\r\n- `DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, string)` eventually calls `formatTimestamp(TimestampData ts, String format, ZoneId zoneId)` in `DateTimeUtils.java`, which uses [DateTimeFormatter](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36941#L724). \r\n\r\n-  `DATE_FORMAT(string, string) `eventually calls `formatTimestampStringWithOffset(String dateStr, String fromFormat, String toFormat, TimeZone tz, long offsetMills)` in `DateTimeUtils.java`, which uses  [SimpleDateFormat](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/1523f2c2062b860a2abfe75f8ead276bb161d64a/flink-table/flink-table-common/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/utils/DateTimeUtils.java#L743).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Update documentation for` DATE_FORMAT`. \r\n  - Add additional python tests for specific `DATE_FORMAT` functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nAdded python tests for for specific `DATE_FORMAT` functions.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe have rewrite the `processWatermark` in abstract operators for async state processing. The sub-classes need a proper hook for doing something right before the watermark processing and right after the watermark emit.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add `preProcessWatermark` and `postProcessWatermark` in abstract operators for async state processing.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n - Added `testWatermarkHooks` in corresponding test classes.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nNot all file systems currently support `Symbolic Link`, such as `FAT32`, `ISO9660` and so on. `Fast Link` is a `Symbolic Link` designed specifically for **Disaggregated State Storage(ForSt)**, even if the underlying layer file system does not support `Symbolic Link`. on the basis of `Symbolic Link`, `Fast link` will also provide the file ownership management(claim and no-claim) in the future.\r\n\r\nThis pr implements fast link for ForStFileSystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Introduce `FileMappingManager` to manager the file mapping in ForStFileSystem.\r\n- Adapt `ForStFileSystem` to `FileMappingManager`  \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `FileMappingManagerTest`\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests:\r\n- `ForStStateBackendV2Test#testAsyncStateBackendScaleUp`\r\n- `ForStStateBackendV2Test#testAsyncStateBackendScaleDown`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-19T08:07:37Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T13:00:26Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T13:00:25Z","merged_at":"2025-01-06T13:00:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"9878e561af30a90dd5491e9df9c99c8c17734a82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a7eed3d1827987dd2226cb1f3371f21f08d5817b","head":{"label":"fredia:impl_link","ref":"impl_link","sha":"a7eed3d1827987dd2226cb1f3371f21f08d5817b","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe have introduced the `EpochManager` to handle the watermark during async state processing. The inputs are divided into several epochs where a action is attached and triggered after all the inputs finished their async processing. However, the action itself may trigger more async procedures which blocks some synchronous action. Thus this PR introduces two types of action, one is for triggered right after all the inputs finished, while another is for being triggered after all the async processing including the ones from the action finished.\r\n\r\nThis is a complete solution & abstraction of watermark handling. I'll revert some change from FLINK-36875, removing the unnecessary use of `CompletableFuture`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Remove `CompletableFuture` in signatures of `advanceWatermark`.\r\n - Introduce `triggerAction` and `finalAction` for each `Epoch`\r\n - Proper handle the state machine of `Epoch`\r\n - Support inheritance of `Epoch` for `asyncProcessWithKey`, meaning that the context during `asyncProcessWithKey` will share the same `epoch` from invoker's context.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added two tests `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorTest#testWatermark` and `EpochManagerTest#testTwoAction`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRestores compatibility with Logback 1.2, fixes issues [FLINK-36104](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36104) and [FLINK-36227](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36227).\r\n\r\nMaster branch still uses SLF4J 1.7 so this PR should target both master and Flink 1.20.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNot feasible to do in an automated manner because it depends global MDC implementation picked up by SLF4J. Tested manually by adding a new test to `MdcUtilsTest`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testContextResetWorksWithNullContext() {\r\n        MDC.clear();\r\n        assertThat(MDC.getCopyOfContextMap()).isNull();\r\n        MdcCloseable restoreContext = MdcUtils.withContext(Collections.emptyMap());\r\n        assertDoesNotThrow(restoreContext::close);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand changing flink-core/pom.xml to use Logback:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>flink-test-utils-junit</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<exclusions>\r\n\t\t\t\t<exclusion>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<artifactId>*</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t\t</exclusion>\r\n\t\t\t\t<exclusion>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<artifactId>*</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t\t</exclusion>\r\n\t\t\t</exclusions>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<version>1.2.13</version>\r\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<version>1.2.13</version>\r\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-17T18:27:14Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T18:29:09Z","closed_at":"2024-12-17T18:29:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"074f28c12f74100769043dd96a4a2e15c9dd8d09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1a0227f86d34f43d414f9f48e3e0cb7d7124dbcf","head":{"label":"afedulov:FLINK-33117","ref":"FLINK-33117","sha":"1a0227f86d34f43d414f9f48e3e0cb7d7124dbcf","user":{"login":"afedulov","id":1492164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov","html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161525880,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE1MjU4ODA=","name":"flink","full_name":"afedulov/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"afedulov","id":1492164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov","html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-36873][runtime] Adapting batch job progress recovery to Apache Celeborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdapting batch job progress recovery to Apache Celeborn.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by ShuffleMasterSnapshotUtilTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-17T12:31:15Z","updated_at":"2024-12-19T08:44:30Z","closed_at":"2024-12-19T06:13:33Z","merged_at":"2024-12-19T06:13:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6c3e8cddd4b01b0df1a772cbbafbc3bc5cf9a7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b868c0a44f00036e62d0a37ac4f74b525ecb855c","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLINK-36873","ref":"FLINK-36873","sha":"b868c0a44f00036e62d0a37ac4f74b525ecb855c","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is a back port of the [PR](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25656) done for [FLINK-28897](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-28897). \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Pulled in the FlinkUserCodeClassLoader for UDF jar loading from the resource manager\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added test case to verify ADD JAR with checkpointing in FunctionITCase in flink-table-planner module.\r\n  - Verified that this test case will fail in older versions without the fix.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running a sample UDF job with checkpointing and verified the working.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-17T11:09:36Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T15:33:17Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"120c05ebbb2d9bbd95dc7bb51bf7f8173a9dc8fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f12f137ae259824341b6bbac537e9503ab5f3ace","head":{"label":"ammu20-dev:release-19-fix-28897","ref":"release-19-fix-28897","sha":"f12f137ae259824341b6bbac537e9503ab5f3ace","user":{"login":"ammu20-dev","id":175413337,"node_id":"U_kgDOCnSYWQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175413337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/ammu20-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":829257896,"node_id":"R_kgDOMW14qA","name":"flink","full_name":"ammu20-dev/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ammu20-dev","id":175413337,"node_id":"U_kgDOCnSYWQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175413337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/ammu20-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ammu20-dev/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnabled dynamic time-related functions to be called with or without parenthesis\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add function call syntax for dynamic functions\r\n- Support null inputTable for sql from tableapi\r\n- Add support for BuiltInFunction test in batch mode\r\n- Add TimeFunctionsBatchModeITCase and testSelectDynamicDatetimeFunctions\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Added TimeFunctionsBatchModeITCase and testSelectDynamicDatetimeFunctions to test all modified functions\r\n \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: don't know\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-17T01:24:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T11:38:03Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T11:38:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"635998effdf1691045d4747ec95359fed171901a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/75776640f2202495e2462c9f514fdf10da4d6d2c","head":{"label":"gustavodemorais:FLINK-36910","ref":"FLINK-36910","sha":"75776640f2202495e2462c9f514fdf10da4d6d2c","user":{"login":"gustavodemorais","id":11739405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzM5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11739405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavodemorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":894940001,"node_id":"R_kgDONVezYQ","name":"flink","full_name":"gustavodemorais/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gustavodemorais","id":11739405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzM5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11739405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavodemorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gustavodemorais/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis refactors the TypeInferenceExtractor to support ProcessTableFunction as defined in FLIP-440.\r\n\r\nThe extractor tries its best to extract list of `StaticArgument` of both scalar and table kind. Table kind can be both typed (structured type) or untyped (Row). `@StateHint` allows defining state entries.\r\n\r\nSome simple examples:\r\n```\r\npublic class StateProcessTableFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Integer> {\r\n    public void eval(@StateHint MyState s, Integer i) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class NamedStateProcessTableFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Integer> {\r\n    public void eval(\r\n            @StateHint(name = \"myState\") MyState s, @ArgumentHint(name = \"myArg\") Integer i) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class MultiStateProcessTableFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Integer> {\r\n    public void eval(@StateHint MyFirstState s1, @StateHint MySecondState s2, Integer i) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class UntypedTableArgProcessTableFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Integer> {\r\n    public void eval(@ArgumentHint(ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_ROW) Row t) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore complex examples can be found in tests.\r\n\r\nSeveral bugs were fixed on the way:\r\n- disallowing nullable types to send data into non-null signatures due to incorrect autoboxing checks\r\n- deriving an input strategy when a static signature is enough\r\n- better error messages and helpful information for users to help specifying the correct parameter ordering\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactor the `FunctionResultTemplate` into dedicated `FunctionStateTemplate` and `FunctionOutputTemplate`\r\n- Unifying the accumulator and state entry logic\r\n- Cleaning up code and find better comments/names for methods for improving code readability.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: TypeInferenceExtractorTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? JavaDocs\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-16T20:49:38Z","updated_at":"2024-12-19T08:28:41Z","closed_at":"2024-12-19T08:28:41Z","merged_at":"2024-12-19T08:28:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab8286e8b5c7895cc0d009521eb9c660eeb01609","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/81946d0ed8b30f9436831d3693b363719839f390","head":{"label":"twalthr:FLINK-36706","ref":"FLINK-36706","sha":"81946d0ed8b30f9436831d3693b363719839f390","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20658760,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY1ODc2MA==","name":"flink","full_name":"twalthr/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n  - Modify web ui to support job graph auto-refresh for Incremental JobGraph Generation.\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Modify the web ui to display the incremental job graph and the unconverted stream node.\r\n  - Add a new checkbox in the webui to select whether to display the unconverted stream node or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a frontend(UI) work and are not covered by tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n \r\n## Preview\r\n<img width=\"985\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a95764a-78ee-41c5-b35d-0faffb6c14fb\"

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[hotfix][configuration] Remove the deprecated test class TaskManagerLoadBalanceModeTest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[hotfix][configuration] Remove the deprecated test class TaskManagerLoadBalanceModeTest.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n  - Extending job detail rest API to adapt to Incremental JobGraph Generation in batch mode. \r\n  - Modify web ui to support job graph auto-refresh for Incremental JobGraph Generation.\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Modify `JobDetailHandler `to return the incrementally updated job graphs.\r\n  - Modify the web ui to display the incremental job graph and the unconverted stream node.\r\n  - Add a new checkbox in the webui to select whether to display the unconverted stream node or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added test that validates that `JsonPlanGenerator ` generates `JsonStreamGraph` works well\r\n  - Added test that validates that `JobDetailHandler` returns Incremental JobGraph as expected\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-15T13:24:37Z","updated_at":"2024-12-28T04:16:10Z","closed_at":"2024-12-28T04:16:10Z","merged_at":"2024-12-28T04:16:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"08990c7d21260dff55e3a499354f5a5980ae68e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273465073,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDY1MDcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/REST","name":"component=Runtime/REST","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/598407cd0a05affcf2a20cd2c6623fd666ff4b2a","head":{"label":"yuchen-ecnu:FLINK-36069","ref":"FLINK-36069","sha":"598407cd0a05affcf2a20cd2c6623fd666ff4b2a","user":{"login":"yuchen-ecnu","id":19743175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzQzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19743175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchen-ecnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":518129640,"node_id":"R_kgDOHuIH6A","name":"flink","full_name":"yuchen-ecnu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuchen-ecnu","id":19743175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzQzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19743175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchen-ecnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuchen-ecnu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce built-in serialization support for common collection types: maps, lists, and sets.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe first three commits are cherry-picked from previously reverted commits (as they break state compatibility and has to be merged at Flink 2.0).\r\n\r\nThe last two commits polish doc on why dedicated serializer is more efficient than Kryo on a high level and addresses the issue that the original Map/List/Set serializer cannot handle null values properly.\r\n\r\n[Reverted, see comments below] The fourth commit adds a new option to control whether to use built-in serialization support for common collection types.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded UTs to cover the handling of null values.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-14T16:18:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T03:39:36Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T02:20:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bf983299b5267a0e01ebc5074d0d6097fdf3aa7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4cc74098dcdb2f9392b6ba436f4ad75344ce49ec","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-36903","ref":"FLINK-36903","sha":"4cc74098dcdb2f9392b6ba436f4ad75344ce49ec","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDisable Kyro by default as per [FLIP-398](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-398%3A+Improve+Serialization+Configuration+And+Usage+In+Flink).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nDisable Kyro by default.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nUpdated serialization document accordingly.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-14T14:43:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T01:22:42Z","closed_at":"2025-01-21T01:22:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f6859a874d4bc27140577aa38649b8c6570e8de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/11a6ac8b4119e091e3bf5d599a5fbaf3da2a71dc","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-34124","ref":"FLINK-34124","sha":"11a6ac8b4119e091e3bf5d599a5fbaf3da2a71dc","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix document error on how to programmatically configure serialization.\r\n\r\n## Brief Changelog\r\n\r\nSince the type of `PipelineOptions.SERIALIZATION_CONFIG` is `ConfigOption<List<String>>`, we should provide a list of String when programmatically configuring it.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is just a doc fix.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nNot applied.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-14T13:43:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T07:13:27Z","closed_at":"2024-12-16T03:30:29Z","merged_at":"2024-12-16T03:30:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d541997954e7b28ffa9df5e4bcaea817c8aa8992","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25795/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25795/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25795/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/17a758da91eab48e9a709d62feb8b0bff7515842","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-36904","ref":"FLINK-36904","sha":"17a758da91eab48e9a709d62feb8b0bff7515842","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

backport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25670 to 1.20\r\nContribute-to: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36901\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request raises the version of the NodeJS module which is a pre-requisite to upgrade dependencies in order to address vulnerabilities in Runtime/WebFrontend component. \r\nThere will be another PR to fix vulnerabilities once this is merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nNodeJS is v22.11.0/Npm is 10.9.0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe Flink UI should be accessible without any difference\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-13T15:46:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T20:28:18Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T20:28:18Z","merged_at":"2025-01-07T20:28:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcc44d2d3b8c6de1de074cf0b3ca21b2c38ff1ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025479,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1NDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/WebFrontend","name":"component=Runtime/WebFrontend","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fea2ff6f18d0b303d2cffe2d4d43c2e75686fa3e","head":{"label":"mehdid93:FLINK-36739_1_20","ref":"FLINK-36739_1_20","sha":"fea2ff6f18d0b303d2cffe2d4d43c2e75686fa3e","user":{"login":"mehdid93","id":52534134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTM0MTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52534134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93","html_url":"https://github.com/mehdid93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":888580594,"node_id":"R_kgDONPap8g","name":"flink","full_name":"mehdid93/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mehdid93","id":52534134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTM0MTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52534134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93","html_url":"https://github.com/mehdid93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehdid93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mehdid93/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe watermark status is not properly handle in async state processing. It is emitted to downstream synchronously, while the watermarks will respect the ongoing timer processing. That should be fixed and aligned.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Rewrite `processWatermarkStatus` in `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2`  and `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator`, making watermark status also respect the timers.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-36067][runtime] Support optimize stream graph based on input info.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  Introduce StreamGraphOptimizer and StreamGraphOptimizationStrategy\r\n  - Support optimize stream graph based on input info.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-10T15:47:47Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T15:53:43Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T15:53:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30b3153f142b847868a93813d39e32569a0856b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c99085adfde53ead525de5ecb479a988c9c93de9","head":{"label":"37-pro:flink-1.20-test","ref":"flink-1.20-test","sha":"c99085adfde53ead525de5ecb479a988c9c93de9","user":{"login":"37-pro","id":52369240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzY5MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52369240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro","html_url":"https://github.com/37-pro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":749607649,"node_id":"R_kgDOLK4a4Q","name":"flink","full_name":"37-pro/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"37-pro","id":52369240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzY5MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52369240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro","html_url":"https://github.com/37-pro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/37-pro/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-10T15:35:26Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T15:37:52Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T15:37:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1494217fbbbeb0d729f9ccc4091db2be207892fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25780/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25780/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25780/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/86f3f14fa9e18a8382fa2ca60a5ee197ccb67328","head":{"label":"37-pro:flink-1.20-test","ref":"flink-1.20-test","sha":"86f3f14fa9e18a8382fa2ca60a5ee197ccb67328","user":{"login":"37-pro","id":52369240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzY5MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52369240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro","html_url":"https://github.com/37-pro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":749607649,"node_id":"R_kgDOLK4a4Q","name":"flink","full_name":"37-pro/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"37-pro","id":52369240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzY5MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52369240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro","html_url":"https://github.com/37-pro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/37-pro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/37-pro/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR makes timers completed before emitting watermark.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Let `advanceWatermark` return `CompletableFuture`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `InternalTimerServiceAsyncImplTest#testSameKeyEventTimerFireOrder`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-10T06:53:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T02:35:14Z","closed_at":"2024-12-12T02:35:24Z","merged_at":"2024-12-12T02:35:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"43c50b914180de77e8b0b722124d079085a3ad91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cd2a9cc4bb1514a00f7653d26f5d2c58faa174c1","head":{"label":"fredia:fix_timer","ref":"fix_timer","sha":"cd2a9cc4bb1514a00f7653d26f5d2c58faa174c1","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the ForSt core use `ForStFlinkFileSystem` via JNI to manipulate files. However, the parameter and return value contains `Path`, which introduces redundant JNI call to convert from/to std::string. This PR provides methods with string directly.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce proxy classes with string input and output. \r\n- Bump ForSt version to 0.1.4-beta which uses the stringified methods.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is basically a backport of 1.20 from https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25755.\r\n\r\n`CollectSinkOperatorFactory` is not respecting `collect-sink.batch-size.max` and `collect-sink.socket-timeout` configuration but only the default value used. As a result state reading can blow up. In this PR I've changed `CollectSinkOperatorFactory` to read the mentioned 2 parameters.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n`CollectSinkOperatorFactory` is now reading the mentioned 2 parameters.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTrivial change + manual with state reading.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe Flink TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ is lacking some behaviors, compared with other vendors. eg. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_timestamp\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following additional functions for TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ. \r\n```\r\nTO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(string1) -- Parse timestamp with default format \r\nTO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(string1, string2) -- Parse timestamp with custom format \r\nTO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(string1, string2, string3) -- Parse timestamp with format and timezone \r\nTO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(numeric) -- For epoch milliseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add the additional overloading functions for TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ.\r\n  - Add java test cases. \r\n  - Make sure the current scala tests pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, `TemporalTypesTest.scala`.\r\nAdded additional tests in `TimeFunctionsITCase.java`. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: ( no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use `EpochManager` to manage the watermark in async state processing. We found an issue when a watermark reached and no further input reach for a while, the epoch/watermark will be triggered twice. Current PR fix this.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Stricter conditions to ensure no recursive call of triggering.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change modified test `EpochManagerTest` that can verify this.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere is a internal state interface hierarchy for state v2, which is pretty much like the one for state v1. Currently the `InternalListState` does not extend from `InternalMergingState` for convenience of class type parameter signature. However, the table implementation depends on the inheritance, so this PR adds it back.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Extract a `InternalStateAccessible` interface from `InternalAppendingState`\r\n - Make `InternalListState` inherit `InternalMergingState`\r\n - Implement necessary methods from `InternalMergingState` for existing List States.\r\n\r\n - Also, a hotfix fixing the state adaptor\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests `ForStListStateTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-07T04:52:15Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T03:28:41Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T03:28:38Z","merged_at":"2024-12-10T03:28:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"e016051e2c18227bb700e292c10c3a5fec25a588","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25760/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/464745a03f4fed52fbb49579df1ccd47e86767aa","head":{"label":"Zakelly:f36860","ref":"f36860","sha":"464745a03f4fed52fbb49579df1ccd47e86767aa","user":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263260000,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyNjAwMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Zakelly/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe need a fix for both SECOND and MINUTE.\r\n\r\nThe following query doesn't work:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  FLOOR(\r\n      CAST(TIMESTAMP '2024-04-25 17:19:42.654' AS TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3))\r\n  TO MINUTE) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two queries work:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  FLOOR(\r\n      CAST(TIMESTAMP '2024-04-25 17:19:42.654' AS TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3))\r\n  TO HOUR) \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  FLOOR(\r\n      TIMESTAMP '2024-04-25 17:19:42.654'\r\n  TO MINUTE) \r\n```\r\n\r\nStack trace for the first not working query from above:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: io.confluent.flink.table.utils.CleanedException: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: Line 41, Column 69: No applicable constructor/method found for actual parameters \"org.apache.flink.table.data.TimestampData, org.apache.flink.table.data.TimestampData\"; candidates are: \"public static long org.apache.flink.table.runtime.functions.SqlFunctionUtils.floor(long, long)\", \"public static float org.apache.flink.table.runtime.functions.SqlFunctionUtils.floor(float)\", \"public static org.apache.flink.table.data.DecimalData org.apache.flink.table.runtime.functions.SqlFunctionUtils.floor(org.apache.flink.table.data.DecimalData)\", \"public static int org.apache.flink.table.runtime.functions.SqlFunctionUtils.floor(int, int)\", \"public static double org.apache.flink.table.runtime.functions.SqlFunctionUtils.floor(double)\"\r\nat org.codehaus.janino.UnitCompiler.compileError(UnitCompiler.java:13080)\r\nat org.codehaus.janino.UnitCompiler.findMostSpecificIInvocable(UnitCompiler.java:9646)\r\nat org.codehaus.janino.UnitCompiler.findIMethod(UnitCompiler.java:9506)\r\nat org.codehaus.janino.UnitCompiler.findIMethod(UnitCompiler.java:9422)\r\nat org.codehaus.janino.UnitCompiler.compileGet2(UnitCompiler.java:5263)\r\n... \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests in `TimeFunctionsITCase`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25733\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor Table API, there are 5 time-related functions that can't be called right now. This maps these the function calls for CURRENT_DATE, LOCALTIMESTAMP, LOCALTIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIME currectly. These function do not support parenthesis when being called.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add NO_PARENTHESIS call syntax\r\n  - Use it for CURRENT_DATE, LOCALTIMESTAMP, LOCALTIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIME \r\n  - Update serialization tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added serialization tests to make sure the table api call get's mapped to the proper SQL Function\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: don't know\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T13:27:41Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T16:44:11Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T16:44:11Z","merged_at":"2024-12-06T16:44:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbe1946923ec72d0fb0af7199adc6314ba4fc128","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ac0432df963ab7c9ddcd5ccd4cedb58e411cbaee","head":{"label":"gustavodemorais:FLINK-36840-OS-BP","ref":"FLINK-36840-OS-BP","sha":"ac0432df963ab7c9ddcd5ccd4cedb58e411cbaee","user":{"login":"gustavodemorais","id":11739405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzM5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11739405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavodemorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":894940001,"node_id":"R_kgDONVezYQ","name":"flink","full_name":"gustavodemorais/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gustavodemorais","id":11739405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzM5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11739405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavodemorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavodemorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gustavodemorais/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`CollectSinkOperatorFactory` is not respecting `collect-sink.batch-size.max` and `collect-sink.socket-timeout` configuration but only the default value used. As a result state reading can blow up. In this PR I've changed `CollectSinkOperatorFactory` to read the mentioned 2 parameters.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n`CollectSinkOperatorFactory` is now reading the mentioned 2 parameters.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTrivial change + manual with state reading.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Support to deploy script via SQL Client.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Support to deploy script*\r\n  - *Support to deploy script with remote jar*\r\n  - *Relax the limitation that script exists in local*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests to check deploy script with fake target*\r\n  - *Added E2E case to fetch resources from the remote jar*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T12:13:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T11:15:17Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T11:15:17Z","merged_at":"2025-01-07T11:15:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a8b8c03e3aa2677fe5ab94a09ee8ae754785938","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c459f44469a6bbf061dcbce701a18c114fe47e18","head":{"label":"fsk119:client","ref":"client","sha":"c459f44469a6bbf061dcbce701a18c114fe47e18","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis is to optimize SELECT DISTINCT query from using GroupAgg to DeDuplicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a new Calcite rule that does the following:\r\n- Check if the user is running SELECT DISTINCT query.\r\n- Originally we want convert the current plan from StreamPhysicalDeduplicate instead of StreamPhysicalGroupAggregateRule in rowtime. After discussion in OSS community, Lincoln in OSS decided to refactor Deduplicate optimization to defer to StreamPhysicalRank for valid StreamExecDeduplicate node conversion to avoid exceptions. [PR](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25380)\r\nSo instead, we are optimizing by converting the current plan from FlinkLogicalRank instead of FlinkLogicalAggregate in rowtime, which has the similar effect as of the original plan.\r\n- Modify existing tests to reflect the new optimizer. \r\n- We decided that because of this bug, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35792, we will avoid optimizing for this particular case. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests in the table/planner module.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport `getOrCreateKeyedState()` and  `isSafeToReuseKVState()` for AsyncKeyedStateBackend.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `getOrCreateKeyedState()` and `isSafeToReuseKVState()`  to `AsyncKeyedStateBackend`\r\n- Implement `getOrCreateKeyedState()` and `isSafeToReuseKVState()`  in subclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n- `AbstractKeyedStateTestBase`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36072\r\nOptimizing the Overhead of the Network Layer in Adaptive Execution Scenarios\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - On the downstream side, enable a single input gate to support a single input channel consuming multiple subpartitions.\r\n  - On the upstream side, enable sort-merge shuffle could use single partition reader to read multiple subpartitions\r\n  - On the upstream side, enable sort-merge shuffle supports accumulating small buffers to reduce network overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified such as CreditBasedPartitionRequestClientHandlerTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDo not use deprecated configs in example config.yaml. Currently, in the example `flink-dist/src/main/resources/config.yaml`, we provided some deprecated configs to guide users to set checkpoints/savepoints. We should update with the new configs.\r\n\r\nref: 1. FLIP-406: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=284789560\r\n       2. https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/config/#checkpointing\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Use `execution.checkpointing.incremental` instead of the deprecated `state.backend.incremental`\r\n  - Use `execution.checkpointing.dir` instead of the deprecated `state.checkpoints.dir`\r\n  - Use `execution.checkpointing.savepoint-dir` instead of the deprecated `state.savepoints.dir`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-33387][runtime] Introduce the abstraction and the interface about loading\r\n- [FLINK-33388][runtime] Support tasks balancing at TM level for Default Scheduler\r\n- [FLINK-35966][runtime] Introduce the TASKS for TaskManagerLoadBalanceMode enum and add the users-oriented interface for default scheduler balanced tasks scheduling.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-33387][runtime] Introduce the abstraction and the interface about loading\r\n- [FLINK-33388][runtime] Support tasks balancing at TM level for Default Scheduler\r\n- [FLINK-35966][runtime] Introduce the TASKS for TaskManagerLoadBalanceMode enum and add the users-oriented interface for default scheduler balanced tasks scheduling.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd the corresponding test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor Table API, there are 5 time-related functions that can't be called right now. This maps these the function calls for CURRENT_DATE, LOCALTIMESTAMP, LOCALTIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIME currectly. These function do not support parenthesis when being called.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add NO_PARENTHESIS call syntax\r\n  - Use it for CURRENT_DATE, LOCALTIMESTAMP, LOCALTIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIME \r\n  - Update serialization tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added serialization tests to make sure the table api call get's mapped to the proper SQL Function\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: don't know\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently there is an issue in the forst db core, where the background cannot properly quit when db close. Thus we manually join those threads in backend side.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to implement Generalized Watermark in DataStream V2, which can be emitted from the source or other operators, propagate along the streams, received by downstream operators, and aligned during propagation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Introduce Generalized Watermark related API in ProcessFunction\r\n- Propagate and combine Generalized Watermark in Runtime module\r\n- Add unit test case and integration test case for Generalized Watermark\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- org.apache.flink.streaming.api.watermark.generalized.WatermarkCombinerTest\r\n- org.apache.flink.datastream.impl.utils.WatermarkUtilsTest\r\n- org.apache.flink.test.streaming.api.datastream.WatermarkITCase\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add REST API to deploy script into application cluster.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add deployScript method in service to deploy cluster.*\r\n  - *Add REST API to deploy script.*\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
