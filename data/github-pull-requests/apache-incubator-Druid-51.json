Description\r\nThis PR introduces the refactor detailed in proposal #11690, which consists of two main changes.\r\n\r\nThe first is that `ResourceType` enum is no longer used by `Resource` in favor of using a string. `ResourceType` has been repurposed into a registry of built-in types (and the set of known types can be extended by registering custom types with this registry).\r\n\r\nThe second is that `NamedSchema` has been expanded to include a new method, `getSchemaResourceType` which returns the newly string resource type that should be used to authorize queries against that schema, and this mapping is pushed down into `SqlResourceCollectorShuttle`, which has been modified to construct the set of `Resource` to authorize by checking for table schemas which have a non-null type instead of explicitly only looking for the 'druid' and 'view' schema. Currently only `NamedDruidSchema` and `NamedViewSchema` implement this method with a non-null return value, so the behavior should be all-around unchanged at this time.\r\n\r\nA follow-up PR will add `NamedSystemSchema` to this list so that the system schema tables can be directly authorized (on top of the per row filtering that occurs based on the other permissions of the user), and `NamedLookupSchema` could similarly be added in the future to provide authorization against lookup queries (though additional work would need to be done to fully authorize lookups used via expressions or extraction functions).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-11T10:48:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:42:30Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T16:53:26Z","merged_at":"2021-09-17T16:53:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"392f0ca1b52ee66aa8b3affed58eb117bb44d910","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

For example: -->\r\n\r\nFrom the proposal [Dynamic prioritization and laning #6993] raised,  there seems only the HTTP client connection limit from brokers to historicals has been solved. In this pr, I would like to add laning stragegy for the merge buffer pool on historicals and brokers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple, I just limit each lane use only partial mergeBuffer pool according to the lane configuration. For example, if we use hilo laning strategy and maxLowPercent is 50%, then the low lane can only use 50% of the mergeBuffer pool, while the high can use all of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\nI have come to this idea when I try to use the http connection lane strategy to protect our short running queries from long running queries,  it helps but not enough. Without laning the mergeBuffers, we can only limit the http connections for the long running queries. However, if the long running connections are more than the mergeBuffers, the heavy queries will still block later group by queries, no matter they are short or long running, then blocked short running group by queries may use out of the connections, which surely block other timeseries and topn queries. On the other side, make the connections smaller than mergeBuffers may reject timeseries and topn queries directly, which do not need the mergeBuffer.\r\n\r\nAdd a laning strategy for mergeBuffer pool seems a better approach for me.

The cpu is also a problem as priority is same in test1, causing some timeseries queries failed.\r\n\r\nSo here comes my final approach to protect the short running queries from the long running queries, and make the throughout higher.\r\n1. make the long running queries with low  priority, to make they acquire the cpu after short running queries, especially when scheduling the processing thread.\r\n2. put the long running queries to low lane, and always keep some mergeBuffers for short running queries.\r\n\r\nBesides, I have run these tests many times on my mac book, the mergeBuffer laning strategy as test3 surely makes small group by queries succeed more. But it is not that obviously when comparing how many long running queries succeed and how much time the short and long cost.  However, at most time, higher priority almost make short running queries finish faster and succeed more, and low parallelism may make more long running queries succeed as cpu competition is less. \r\n\r\nHere is my test parameters:\r\n1. I use the yellow_tripdata dataset to make this test and the cost unit is millisecond. \r\n2. The big group by scan  two year data, the medium group by scan  one year data, and the small scan only one month data.\r\n3. timeout is 120 seconds. \r\n4. historical server has 2 merge buffers, 8 processing thread and 100 http thread.\r\n5. connections between broker and historical server is 50 \r\n6. maxLowPercent is 50% when use hilo lane strategy, so there is only one merge buffer for heavy queries.\r\n7. submit short running queries with 16 parallelism and 8 for long running queries\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Description\r\nThis started out as a quest to make JDBC debug level logging slightly more verbose to get a better idea of what is happening, but in the process realized that there are quite a lot of cases where we actually aren't logging any exceptions at all whenever jdbc queries fail; all that is visible is the debug logs indicate that a connection was closed and the client might get a useful error message if it is lucky, but good luck beyond that.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find an easy way to add any sort of centralized error logging for any caught exception in the `DruidAvaticaJsonHandler`, so, I added utility methods to `DruidMeta` to slightly make the 'log and throw' pattern a bit more concise. I don't love it, but at least it makes exceptions actually be logged in the broker in a lot of cases we were missing. To err on the side of caution i essentially went through and looked for places where we were throwing some exception to the wind without any obvious catcher in Druid code (hopefully there should be no duplicates).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I made router debug logs slightly more chatty, including printing query ids when used with a broker selection strategy that parses the query at the router. This log really doesn't add much, since `AsyncQueryForwardingServlet` is quite chatty already from the base class structure it picks up by being a `AsyncProxyServlet`, but does at least print some things in Druid terms I guess.\r\n\r\nThis will probably fail CI because its all log messages and didn't add any tests...\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-08T10:53:18Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:42:38Z","closed_at":"2021-09-16T08:28:16Z","merged_at":"2021-09-16T08:28:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"3044372fc10671dc2ab2778dd5fd9cfa10b415b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR adds SQL functions `MV_FILTER_ONLY` and `MV_FILTER_NONE` which will filter rows of multi-value string dimensions to include only or none of the a supplied list of values respectively.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, this uses a new native virtual column type, `ListFilteredVirtualColumn`, which is the equivalent of `ListFilteredDimensionSpec`, but migrated to use a `VirtualColumn` since I think we'd eventually like to deprecate `DimensionSpec` in favor of `VirtualColumn`, and also because SQL is already wired to have `VirtualColumns`.\r\n\r\nSQL planning has been lightly modified to allow non-expression based virtual columns to be registered alongside regular expression columns.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue I found by accident in `HashVectorGrouper`, which was incorrectly initializing a hashtable at the starting position of the memory rather than the penultimate table ending position.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't cause an issue, _except_ in the case where there is only enough room to grow a single time, because it results in overlapping memory regions for the tables when the max sized table tries to use the same position 0. This causes a query failure because initializing the new hashtable clears out the buckets from the overlapping old table, causing copy to do nothing and explode with an error of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: New table size[0] != old table size[2] after copying\r\n    at org.apache.druid.query.groupby.epinephelinae.collection.MemoryOpenHashTable.copyTo(MemoryOpenHashTable.java:201) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.druid.query.groupby.epinephelinae.HashVectorGrouper.grow(HashVectorGrouper.java:322) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.druid.query.groupby.epinephelinae.HashVectorGrouper.aggregateVector(HashVectorGrouper.java:164) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.druid.query.groupby.epinephelinae.vector.VectorGroupByEngine$VectorGroupByEngineIterator.initNewDelegate(VectorGroupByEngine.java:393) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.druid.query.groupby.epinephelinae.vector.VectorGroupByEngine$VectorGroupByEngineIterator.hasNext(VectorGroupByEngine.java:304) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf the added test cases, only `testGrowOnce` fails prior to the fix in this PR. Im sure there is a more clever way to test this than explicit 'testGrowN` methods, but it was not immediately obvious to me so maybe a future improvement.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-01T06:56:28Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T03:16:41Z","closed_at":"2021-09-02T09:25:27Z","merged_at":"2021-09-02T09:25:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"59d257816b85dbeeca336b8e25d341d67bbc5697","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a cancellation API for SQLs mentioned in #4047. Similar to the cancellation API for native queries, this new API first performs authorization to see whether the requester has read permission for all resources of the query. If it does, the API cancels _all_ sql queries of the given `sqlQueryId`. \r\n\r\nWhen a query is canceled, its `SqlLifecycle` is marked as canceled immediately. Once it's marked, the state transition in `SqlLifecycle` throws `QueryInterruptedException` with `QUERY_CANCELLED` error code.  Additionally, I reduced the locking to coordinate only the accesses to `state` in `SqlLifecycle` as it doesn't need to be thread-safe except for canceling. For canceling, it uses a lock and a thread-safe data structure to coordinate concurrent state transitions in `SqlLifecycle`. This was necessary for the cancel API to be able to interrupt while the query is running, especially while executing `SqlLifecycle.execute()`.\r\n\r\nWhen the query is cancelled before its execution starts, the broker will emit a request log and metrics for the cancelled query. These log and metrics will include `success` of false, `sqlQuery/bytes` of -1, `interrupted` of true and the reason for interruption.\r\n\r\nThe web console is currently simply closing the client connection when the query is canceled and this behavior has not changed in this PR. As it seems that the web console is doing the same even for native queries, we can fix them all in a follow-up PR. Documentation will be in the follow-up PR as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SqlLifecycle`\r\n * `SqlLifecycleManager`\r\n * `SqlResource`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

custom coordinator duty integration test\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis is a follow to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11601\r\nThe integration test for the custom coordinator duty was actually not correct. The config to setup custom coordinator duty was not done correctly and hence the custom coordinator duty, KillSupervisorsCustomDuty, was not running. The test did still pass because the normal KillSupervisors coordinator was running. This PR make sure that the custom coordinator duty integration test (in the custom-coordinator-duties group) was the correct config set.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ]

functionality for integration test to run command inside the Docker container\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd functionality for integration test to run command inside the Docker container. This is useful for when integration test needs to interact with the system that is running Druid for testing/verification purposes. For example, verifying that file on local disk was created or deleted by Druid can be done by running `test -f /some/file/on/local/disk/inside/container` using this new functionality. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\nThis fixes an issue were an batch ingestion spec with segment granularity of period  and a non UTC time zone would throw an exception during the segment creation phase. The issue is that code previous to to this fix was de-serializing the descriptor.json stored in the persisted directory for the identifier but the de-serialized identifier did not match the original identifier. The deserialized identifier was converted to UTC and the original contained a non-UTC interval. This fix relies on the fact that current code had enough metadata to avoid de-serializing the descriptor JSON but if future (or code elsewhere) code requires this de-serialization with the requirement to obtain the identifier it may still have problems.\r\n\r\nThe change was in the `BatchAppenderator#push` and related methods.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

change-set does the following:\r\n- Include a new [IPAddress](https://github.com/seancfoley/IPAddress) java library dependency to handle IP addresses.\r\n- Migrate the IPv4 address functions -- `IPV4_MATCH()`, `IPV4_PARSE()`, `IPV4_STRINGIFY()` to use the above package `inet.ipaddr` instead of the `org.apache.commons.net`, `com.google.common.net` and `java.net` packages.\r\n\r\n**Rationale:**\r\n- The `org.apache.commons.net.util.SubnetUtils` class doesn't support IPv6 addresses yet. Please see the open JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-405.  In order to support IPV6 address functions, going down the path of writing custom regexes, parser and longest string matching functions can be tricky given the various IPv6 address formats. The newly added `ipaddress` library supports these right out of the box, so we could leverage that.\r\n- In the future, if there is a desire to expose the IP address parsing options as run time context parameters or similar, it can be plumbed in relatively easily since the java library provides flexibility there.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Next steps**:\r\nIf this looks good, I will go ahead and make an attempt at adding the IPv6 address functions. Open to suggestions. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nBenchmark comparison between the new ipaddress package and the old subnet utils package:\r\n```bash\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseStringUsingIpAddr                        10  avgt    5     6185.716 ±    220.531  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseStringUsingIpAddr                       100  avgt    5    64528.912 ±  10058.256  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseStringUsingIpAddr                      1000  avgt    5   617576.564 ± 129451.314  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseStringUsingSubnetUtils                   10  avgt    5     7972.548 ±   3246.404  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseStringUsingSubnetUtils                  100  avgt    5    51201.575 ±  68695.599  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseStringUsingSubnetUtils                 1000  avgt    5   691529.605 ± 704383.570  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseLongUsingIpAddr                          10  avgt    5      258.954 ±      2.800  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseLongUsingIpAddr                         100  avgt    5     2466.993 ±      7.883  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseLongUsingIpAddr                        1000  avgt    5    24735.502 ±    228.493  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseLongUsingSubnetUtils                     10  avgt    5        8.147 ±      0.549  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseLongUsingSubnetUtils                    100  avgt    5       57.435 ±      2.224  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.parseLongUsingSubnetUtils                   1000  avgt    5      566.308 ±     31.257  ns/op\r\n\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.stringContainsUsingIpAddr                     10  avgt    5    10829.294 ±    929.158  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.stringContainsUsingIpAddr                    100  avgt    5   105955.838 ±   2047.309  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.stringContainsUsingIpAddr                   1000  avgt    5  1070301.262 ±  95573.228  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.stringContainsUsingSubnetUtils                10  avgt    5    14650.519 ±    755.609  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.stringContainsUsingSubnetUtils               100  avgt    5   151821.759 ±  44261.354  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.stringContainsUsingSubnetUtils              1000  avgt    5  1508744.485 ±  61303.553  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.toLongUsingIpAddr                             10  avgt    5        9.470 ±      0.043  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.toLongUsingIpAddr                            100  avgt    5       62.052 ±      3.588  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.toLongUsingIpAddr                           1000  avgt    5     2042.493 ±     77.128  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.toLongUsingSubnetUtils                        10  avgt    5     2014.053 ±    151.281  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.toLongUsingSubnetUtils                       100  avgt    5    19694.955 ±   6740.819  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.toLongUsingSubnetUtils                      1000  avgt    5   207336.015 ±   9011.625  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.longContainsUsingIpAddr                       10  avgt    5     3959.837 ±     11.629  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.longContainsUsingIpAddr                      100  avgt    5    44261.551 ±    191.061  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.longContainsUsingIpAddr                     1000  avgt    5   441864.580 ±   1245.393  ns/op\r\n\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.longContainsUsingSubnetUtils                  10  avgt    5     2104.853 ±     41.862  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.longContainsUsingSubnetUtils                 100  avgt    5    20934.168 ±    382.555  ns/op\r\nIPv4AddressBenchmark.longContainsUsingSubnetUtils                1000  avgt    5   198465.549 ±   2022.392  ns/op\r\n```\r\nAs we can see above, in most cases, the new `ipaddress` library does better in most cases.

Description\r\n\r\nToday we ingest a number of high cardinality metrics into Druid across dimensions. These metrics are rolled up on a per minute basis, and are very useful when looking at metrics on a partition or client basis. Events is another class of data that provides useful information about a particular incident/scenario inside a Kafka cluster. Events themselves are carried inside kafka payload, but nonetheless there are some very useful metadata that is carried in kafka headers that can serve as useful dimension for aggregation and in turn bringing better insights.\r\n\r\nPR(https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10730) introduced support of Kafka headers in InputFormats.\r\n\r\nWe still need an input format to parse out the headers and translate those into relevant columns in Druid. Until that’s implemented, none of the information available in the Kafka message headers would be exposed. So first there is a need to write an input format that can parse headers in any given format(provided we support the format) like we parse payloads today. Apart from headers there is also some useful information present in the key portion of the kafka record. We also need a way to expose the data present in the key as druid columns. We need a generic way to express at configuration time what attributes from headers, key and payload need to be ingested into druid. We need to keep the design generic enough so that users can specify different parsers for headers, key and payload.\r\n\r\nThis PR is designed to solve the above by providing wrapper around any existing input formats and merging the data into a single unified Druid row.\r\n\r\nLets look at a sample input format from the above discussion\r\n\r\n\"inputFormat\":\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"kafka\",     // New input format type\r\n    \"headerLabelPrefix\": \"kafka.header.\",   // Label prefix for header columns, this will avoid collusions while merging columns\r\n    \"recordTimestampLabelPrefix\": \"kafka.\",  // Kafka record's timestamp is made available in case payload does not carry timestamp\r\n    \"headerFormat\":  // Header parser specifying that values are of type string\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"string\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"valueFormat\": // Value parser from json parsing\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"json\",\r\n        \"flattenSpec\": {\r\n          \"useFieldDiscovery\": true,\r\n          \"fields\": [...]\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"keyFormat\":  // Key parser also from json parsing\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"json\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSince we have independent sections for header, key and payload, it will enable parsing each section with its own parser, eg., headers coming in as string and payload as json. \r\n\r\nKafkaInputFormat will be the uber class extending inputFormat interface and will be responsible for creating individual parsers for header, key and payload, blend the data resolving conflicts in columns and generating a single unified InputRow for Druid ingestion. \r\n\r\n\"headerFormat\" will allow users to plug parser type for the header values and will add default header prefix as \"kafka.header.\"(can be overridden) for attributes to avoid collision while merging attributes with payload.\r\n\r\nKafka payload parser will be responsible for parsing the Value portion of the Kafka record. This is where most of the data will come from and we should be able to plugin existing parser. One thing to note here is that if batching is performed, then the code is augmenting header and key values to every record in the batch.\r\n\r\nKafka key parser will handle parsing Key portion of the Kafka record and will ingest the Key with dimension name as \"kafka.key\".\r\n\r\n## KafkaInputFormat Class: \r\nThis is the class that orchestrates sending the consumerRecord to each parser, retrieve rows, merge the columns into one final row for Druid consumption. KafkaInputformat should make sure to release the resources that gets allocated as a part of reader in CloseableIterator<InputRow> during normal and exception cases.\r\n\r\nDuring conflicts in dimension/metrics names, the code will prefer dimension names from payload and ignore the dimension either from headers/key. This is done so that existing input formats can be easily migrated to this new format without worrying about losing information.\r\n\r\nThis code has been tested locally(mac laptop) with production data and following are the performance numbers\r\nVanilla payload parser using json - 19 million records ingested/hour\r\nNew kafka input format with header parsing - 17 million records ingested/hour\r\n\r\nCurrently this code has been deployed in lab/stage environments and ingesting over 100 million records/day.\r\n\r\n@xvrl \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n - [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new function, `sleep`, that makes the current thread sleep for the given amount of seconds. This function is applied per row, and thus Druid does not guarantee the consistent sleep time across queries. Instead, the actual sleep time can vary depending on how much parallelism is used for each query. As a result, this function is intended to use only for testing when you want to keep some query running for a long period.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `sleep` SQL function is evaluated during the query planning when it accepts a number literal. I think this is OK for now as the function is supposed to be used only in tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Sleep`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

as additional info columns\r\n- By default the table is ordered on `Lookup name` now\r\n- Validation of the form has been updated to make `Poll period` required for extraction lookups as not setting it is guaranteed to be a time bomb for when a new server is spun up and the lookups go out of sync.\r\n- Error reporting in forms has been improved (see screenshot below)\r\n- The script that extracts SQL functions from the docs has been made more robust (it was not finding the `MV_*` functions before)\r\n- Data loader can auto detect more delimiter types\r\n\r\nNew inline error validation:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/130115684-da810f89-3ded-40ec-a491-d2ec852b9d83.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested

bug in Variance Buffer Aggregator resulting in intermittent NaN when druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn aggregate method of the Buffer ObjectVarianceAggregator, we should skip merging the ObjectVarianceAggregators when the other ObjectVarianceAggregator has count == 0\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how NaN can be returned:\r\nImagine two Buffer ObjectVarianceAggregators, \r\nthe current ObjectVarianceAggregator has count = 2, sum = 0, var =0\r\nand other ObjectVarianceAggregator (holder2) has count =0, sum=0, var = 0\r\nThe aggregate method would run as follows:\r\n`final double ratio = count / (double) holder2.count;`\r\nratio becomes infinity\r\nthen\r\n`final double t = sum / ratio - holder2.sum;`\r\nt becomes 0\r\nand finally\r\n`nvariance += holder2.nvariance + (ratio / (count + holder2.count) * t * t);`\r\nis the same as\r\n`holder2.nvariance + (infinity / 2 * 0 * 0);`\r\nand infinity / 2 is NaN\r\nHence, variance will be NaN\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

custom coordinator duties\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe coordinator periodically runs jobs, so-called `CoordinatorDuty` which include loading new segments, segment balancing, etc. These are essential for keeping the druid cluster operating in production. Currently, these duties are hard-coded and thus hard to write custom duties. However, Druid users may want to add custom duties which are not part of Core Druid. This PR makes the coordinator duty pluggable so that users can register their own duties. \r\n\r\nIn the new system for pluggable Coordinator duties, similar to what coordinator already does today, the duties can be grouped into `CoordinatorDutyGroups`. All duties in the same group will have the same run period. Currently, there is a single thread running the duties sequentially for each group. However, in the future each group may use a different thread to run its duties. \r\n\r\nNote that you will now be able to add custom coordinator duties without having to modify any Core Druid classes.\r\n\r\nThe configuration for this pluggable Coordinator duty system is as follows:\r\n```\r\ndruid.coordinator.dutyGroups=[<GROUP_NAME>]\r\ndruid.coordinator.<GROUP_NAME>.duties=[<DUTY_NAME_MATCHING_JSON_TYPE_NAME>]\r\ndruid.coordinator.<GROUP_NAME>.duty.<DUTY_NAME_MATCHING_JSON_TYPE_NAME>.<SOME_CONFIG_1>=100\r\ndruid.coordinator.<GROUP_NAME>.duty.<DUTY_NAME_MATCHING_JSON_TYPE_NAME>.<SOME_CONFIG_2>=200\r\ndruid.coordinator.<GROUP_NAME>.period=\"P1D\"\r\n```\r\nThe duties can be grouped into multiple groups as per the elements in list druid.coordinator.dutyGroups.\r\nAll duties in the same group will have the same run period configured by druid.coordinator.<GROUP_NAME>.period.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performance of the segments table by 1) exploiting pre-sorted data structure and 2) caching results to avoid repeated execution of expensive operations. For 1), when the published segments caching is enabled, the cached published segments in `MetadataSegmentView` is sorted in the same order used to sort the available segments in `DruidSchema`. When a query scans segments, the query engine now can merge published and available segments using the merge sorted algorithm as they are sorted in the same order. The previous hash-based merge algorithm is still used when the caching is disabled. Also, `druid.sql.sys.segments.forceHashBasedMerge` is added to force the hash-based merge even when the caching is enabled, which is off by default (merge-sorted is on by default).\r\n\r\nFor 2), scanning the segments table requires to convert timestamps to strings and serialize other non-primitive types to JSON strings. Since string conversion and JSON serialization are expensive operations, a cache is added to avoid calling those operations for the same object repeatedly. The cache can be GCed once the scan is finished.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark results are in the below. This might be a bit biased since all segments had the same metadata, where the technique used for 2) can show the best performance. In reality, since segments can have different segment granularity, dimensions, and metrics, the performance gain could be lower than what is shown here.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster\r\n\r\n Benchmark                            (availableSegmentsInterval)  (forceHashBasedMerge)  (numSegmentsPerInterval)  (publishedSegmentsInterval)  (segmentGranularity)  (sql)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\n SystemSchemaBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                        10               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10    30.596 ±  0.399  ms/op\r\n SystemSchemaBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                        10               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10    39.703 ±  0.238  ms/op\r\n SystemSchemaBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                       100               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10   382.867 ±  6.577  ms/op\r\n SystemSchemaBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                       100               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10   387.911 ±  3.867  ms/op\r\n SystemSchemaBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                      1000               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10  3971.577 ± 70.304  ms/op\r\n SystemSchemaBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                      1000               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10  5334.702 ± 44.773  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPR\r\n\r\n * Benchmark                             (availableSegmentsInterval)  (forceHashBasedMerge)  (numSegmentsPerInterval)  (publishedSegmentsInterval)  (segmentGranularity)  (sql)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                        10               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10    14.914 ±  0.305  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                        10               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10    21.591 ±  0.139  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                       100               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10   199.416 ±  2.208  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                       100               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10   203.366 ±  4.706  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                      1000               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10  2110.735 ± 65.326  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                   true                      1000               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10  2615.910 ± 69.914  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                  false                        10               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10    11.967 ±  0.308  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                  false                        10               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10    18.917 ±  0.220  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                  false                       100               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10   123.630 ±  0.839  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                  false                       100               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10   132.013 ±  0.664  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                  false                      1000               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      0  avgt   10  1303.304 ± 40.063  ms/op\r\n * SegmentsTableBenchmark.segmentsTable               2021-01-01/P3Y                  false                      1000               2021-01-02/P3Y                   DAY      1  avgt   10  1799.447 ± 23.659  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MetadataSegmentView`\r\n * `SegmentsTableRow`\r\n * `SystemSchema`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #11591 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

patch gathers together a variety of SQL from SqlSegmentsMetadataManager\r\nand IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator into a new class SqlSegmentsMetadataQuery.\r\nIt focuses on SQL related to retrieving segment payloads and marking\r\nsegments used and unused.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cleaning up the code a bit, this patch also fixes a bug\r\nwith years before 0 or after 9999.

Clean up some style here and there.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR breaks down the ingestion landing page topic into smaller topics. Some benefits include:\r\n- Ingestion concepts like the Data Model, Rollup, and Partitioning now have smaller more focused topics.\r\n- The Ingestion spec reference stands alone as a reference topic.\r\n- Should make it easier to add conceptual or example material for a specific concept.\r\n\r\nThere may be some trade off in topic maintenance. For example if there's an enhancement to rollup, we may need to edit `rollup.md` and `ingestion-spec.md`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nA temporary config to work around the issue filed in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11544. For native queries, a new parameter, `maxStreamLength` is added for `DoublesSketchAggregatorFactory`. For SQL, a new query context, `approxQuantileDsMaxStreamLength` is added. Note that `approxQuantileDsMaxStreamLength` does not control `maxStreamLength` per individual `DoublesSketchAggregatorFactory`, but applies the same value for all aggregator factories. The rationale for this decision is as below.\r\n\r\n- `approxQuantileDsMaxStreamLength` should not be used to optimize the memory usage of the sketch aggregator, but only used to work around #11544. \r\n- Thus, I don't think users would ever set it to something smaller than default.\r\n- As noted in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11544#issuecomment-895525040, the sketch grows quite slowly when there are more than 1B items (the current max) in the sketch.\r\n- As a result, it doesn't seem worth allowing users to set different `maxStreamLength` for each SQL function. I did it for native queries only because it was the least invasive.\r\n\r\nFinally, the segment size will slightly increase if it has doubles sketches because of the new field added in the sketch.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DoublesSketches`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a new property `druid.router.sql.enable` which allows the\r\nRouter to handle SQL queries when set to `true`.\r\n\r\nThis change does not affect Avatica JDBC requests and they are still routed\r\nby hashing the Connection ID.\r\n\r\nTo allow parsing of the request object as a `SqlQuery` (contained in module __druid-sql__),\r\nsome classes have been moved from __druid-server__ to __druid-services__ with \r\nthe __same package name__.\r\n\r\n### Major Changes\r\n- Add property `druid.router.sql.enable`\r\n- Route SQL queries in `ManualTieredBrokerSelectorStrategy` based on query context\r\n- Move the following classes from __druid-server__ to __druid-services__\r\n  - `AsyncQueryForwardingServlet`\r\n  - `QueryHostFinder`\r\n  - `TieredBrokerHostSelector`\r\n  - `TieredBrokerSelectorStrategy` and its implementations\r\n  - `RouterResource`\r\n  - `CoordinatorRuleManager`\r\n  - corresponding unit tests\r\n- Refactor `AsyncQueryForwardingServlet` to use common code for routing native and SQL queries\r\n- Minor refactor of `QueryHostFinder` to re-use common code\r\n- Add new test dependencies in __druid-services__\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-10T04:41:33Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T03:26:47Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T13:14:39Z","merged_at":"2021-08-13T13:14:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"aaf0aaad8f3936358ab77415df7dcc68d3ee7800","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

In `SpillingGrouper.read()`, return a `Provider` that constructs the necessary `MappingIterator` instead of returning the `MappingIterator` itself. This allows a lambda to be used to capture the file, but postpone processing it until actually needed.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug #11558 \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SpillingGrouper`\r\n * `LazyCloseableIterator`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#10784.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR does the ugly/easy fix to `FilteringCloseableInputRowIterator` to better handle `ParseException` thrown during iteration, due to the fact that some transforming iterators will call `next` on their delegated iterator whenever their own `hasNext` method is called. The trigger in the case of #10784 is the `FluentIterable` transform used by `StreamChunkParser.parseWithParser`, but I would imagine that others are possible due to all the layers of iterators.\r\n\r\nSwitching the iterator to be `Pair<InputRow, ParseException>` would be a fairly disruptive change as far as I can tell, because its sort of iterators all the way down. This would be changing the individual parsers/format readers to mean not throwing ParseException, unless I'm missing something, making it similar to the `sample` interface, which uses `InputRowListPlusRawValues` to provide an iterator of lists of rows, or a parse exception. This isn't necessarily unreasonable to do, but significantly more effort than making this change.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-06T10:25:56Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T09:47:26Z","closed_at":"2021-08-09T19:40:44Z","merged_at":"2021-08-09T19:40:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2ac6cd96edfacca6ba7880d5eb9c532ea0b95f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

#11505.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Changed APIs of `TaskRunner` \r\nChanged following APIs of `TaskRunner` used for emitting statistics for @TaskSlotCountStatsMonitor to return `Map<String, Long>` where key will be worker category and value will be particular metric value. \r\n\r\n```\r\nlong getTotalTaskSlotCount();\r\nlong getIdleTaskSlotCount();\r\nlong getUsedTaskSlotCount();\r\nlong getLazyTaskSlotCount();\r\nlong getBlacklistedTaskSlotCount();\r\n```\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### User-facing Changes\r\nTaskSlot metrics of [indexing service](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/metrics.html#indexing-service) will have worker category as a dimension. Dimension name will be ```category``` .\r\nFollowing five metrics will have ```category``` as dimension.\r\n```\r\ntaskSlot/total/count\r\ntaskSlot/idle/count\r\ntaskSlot/used/count\r\ntaskSlot/lazy/count\r\ntaskSlot/blacklisted/count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ]

ingestion task failure when no input split to process\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR fix a regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11189\r\nThe regression causes ingestion task in parallel mode to fail when there is no input split to process (previously the task would succeed). \r\nThis is because of a null pointer exception occurred in getReports() at https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/2df42143aec6c50e9ac31d89cd75749d10d37a3d/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/task/batch/parallel/ParallelIndexPhaseRunner.java#L296. This is because this method accesses taskMonitor without checking if it is null or not. This is in contrast to all other code in the class, which check if taskMonitor is null or not. Also see in the run() method of the class https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/2df42143aec6c50e9ac31d89cd75749d10d37a3d/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/task/batch/parallel/ParallelIndexPhaseRunner.java#L111, \r\nthat taskMonitor is initialized in line 121, but that does not always happen. If the method returned in line 116, which is when there is no input source to split, then taskMonitor stays null. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-05T09:27:28Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T09:47:11Z","closed_at":"2021-08-09T16:11:08Z","merged_at":"2021-08-09T16:11:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"06bae29979eed20ccc4a75374a5259af02c71014","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area
