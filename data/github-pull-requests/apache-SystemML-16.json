It has significantly lower memory requirement than affine layer making it ideal for devices such as GPUs.\r\n2. It implicitly avoids overfitting by minimizing the number of parameters in the neural network.\r\n3.

It does some calculation in the first steps to get a **bound** `[theta_min, theta_max]` on the hyperparameter of covariance function (different from our model hyperparameters!)\r\n2.

invoke transfer matrix from device to host in two cases:\r\n1. During eviction of unlocked matrices\r\n2. During acquireHostRead\r\n\r\nIf the single-precision support is enabled, then float-to-double conversion is required as CP expects the data to be in double format. This conversion can be done on host or on device. We typically prefer to do this conversion on device due to GPU's high-memory bandwidth. However, the conversion requires an additional space to be allocated for the conversion, which can lead to infinite recursion during eviction: `evict -> devictToHost -> float2double -> allocate -> ensureFreeSpace -> evict`. To avoid this recursion, it is necessary to perform this conversion in host.\r\n\r\n@nakul02 can you please review this PR

Added a rewrite to convert `out = rowSums(matrix(colSums(A), rows=C, cols=HW))` to `out = channel_sums(A)` when `nrow(A) > 1` and exectype is CP or GPU.\r\n- This avoids unnecessary intermediates, GPU-CP-GPU transfer (for reshape) and additional kernel invocation cost.\r\n- When we move to a higher CuDNN version, we can replace the custom `channel_sums` kernel with possibly more optimized CuDNN reduce tensor kernel.\r\n- Added the corresponding CPU and GPU tests.\r\n- Updated `T_MAX(val)` to `MAX()`. Interestingly enough, `nvcc` was smart enough to remove the parameter automatically, hence the ptx remained the same after the change :)\r\n\r\n\r\n@nakul02 can you please review this PR

the `max_pool` is invoked in the forward pass, then its output can be reused by the `max_pool_backward` rather than calling `cudnnPoolingForward` again. For sentence CNN with 2 epochs, this reduces the time for `max_pool_backward` from  6.361 to  2.966 seconds. Here are the stats:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWith this PR (temporarily addressed issue 1 described below by rewriting DML for getting the statistics):\r\n 5  gpu_maxpooling_backward [100:2-101:70] 2.966    936 sync[2.906s,936], nnc[0.000s,936], ad[0.017s,936], nnmb[0.027s,936]\r\n\r\nCurrent Master:\r\n  5  gpu_maxpooling_backward [100:2-101:70] 6.361    936 nnc[0.001s,936], nni[0.006s,936], nnmf[0.015s,936], nnmb[0.015s,936], ad[0.018s,936], sync[6.287s,936]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this optimization is disabled anytime there is a persistent read/write. So there are two (potentially overlapping) options here:\r\n1. Fix following two persistent read/write issues:\r\na. `if loop` in  `nn/layers/dropout.dml`. \r\nb. A separate `cnn-forward()` method in the script.\r\n\r\n2. Add optional argument `max_pool_forward` that accepts output of `max_pool`. This will work even if there are any lingering persistent read/write issues. However, it requires extending the `nn/layers/max_pool2d_builtin.dml` to accept the output of the forward function.\r\n\r\n\r\n@bertholdreinwald @mboehm7 @prithvirajsen  @nakul02  @dusenberrymw

The goal of this PR is not to improve performance (for example: by considering the cost of sparse-to-dense vs FLOPs required given a memory budget) but instead to minimize sparse-to-dense conversion in the GPU matrix multiplication operator. \r\n\r\n2. If `matmult` uses unnecessary sparse-to-dense conversion, then we run into risk of one of the two situations:\r\n-  In best case some of the `matmult` won't be pushed to GPU under worst-case memory budget.\r\n- On other hand, if these conversion are not accounted for, they may cause OOMs.\r\n\r\n3. Every operator (except `dense-sparse matrix multiplication`) uses only memory allocated to input and output matrices.\r\n\r\n4. Since there is no CuSPARSE kernel for `dense-sparse matrix multiplication` operator, we either have to transpose the output after performing sparse-dense matrix multiplication or perform dense-dense matrix multiplication after converting the sparse input to dense format.\r\n\r\n@nakul02  I will post the correctness and performance comparison in few hours. Please review this PR then

`cudnnGetConvolutionBackwardDataAlgorithm` returns `CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_DATA_ALGO_1` for atleast one scenario:\r\n- sentence CNN (N=1, C=1, H=2060, W=300, F=500, Hf=5, Wf=300, sparsity=0.1) which is 200x slower than `CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_DATA_ALGO_0`. \r\n\r\nSince it is difficult to debug a closed-source method `cudnnGetConvolutionBackwardDataAlgorithm`, we will always prefer to use memory-less operator: `CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_DATA_ALGO_0`. We can revisit this for next CuDNN version. This is not an ideal solution, but the simplest one I could think of. I welcome discussion on any alternative solutions you may have.  And this goes without saying, we can revisit this for next CuDNN version.\r\n\r\n@nakul02 @prithvirajsen @bertholdreinwald can you please review this PR ?\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug in CuDNN's `cudnnGetConvolutionBackwardDataAlgorithm`, please use the script https://github.com/apache/systemml/blob/master/scripts/nn/test/compare_backends/test_conv2d_bwd_data.sh and the above mentioned parameters. \r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n- Nvidia K80\r\n- CuDNN 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

doc: Memory estimation of GPU operators\r\n\r\n1. Since not all operator are supported on GPU, isGPUEnabled indicates whether an operation  is enabled for GPU. This method doesnot take into account any memory estimates.\r\n2. To simplify memory estimation logic, the methods computeOutputMemEstimate and computeIntermediateMemEstimate should return maximum of memory required for GPU and CP operators. \r\n3. Additionally, these methods are guarded so that when -gpu flag is not provided, additional memory overhead due to GPU are ignored. For example: sparse-to-dense conversion on GPU. \r\n4. (WIP) Every GPU operators should respect the memory returned by computeIntermediateMemEstimate (and computeOutputMemEstimate - see below point).\r\n5. (WIP) Every GPU operator should create output in the same format as the corresponding CP operator. That is,  computeOutputMemEstimate are consistent across both CP and GPU in terms of worst-case.\r\n6. The drawback of using maximum memory (mem = Math.max(mem_gpu, mem_gpu)) are:\r\n- GPU operator is not selected when mem_gpu < total memory available on GPU < mem\r\n - CP operator is not selected (i.e. distributed operator compiled) when mem_cpu < driver memory budget < mem\r\n\r\n@nakul02

PR contains two fixes:\r\n- First fix ensures that the method allocating output matrix (for eg:\r\ngetSparseMatrixOutputForGPUInstruction,\r\ngetDenseMatrixOutputForGPUInstruction) has correct

If the expected\r\ndimensions don't match to the ones in the symbol table, it throws a\r\nDMLRuntimeException.\r\n- The second fix ensures that long to int conversions in LibMatrixCUDA is
