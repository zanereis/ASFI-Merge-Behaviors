[T1, T2],  when we try to delete a range [T3, T4]\r\nif T3 <= T2 **or** T4 >= T1, we can make sure the two range has intersection, and `canSkipDelete` should return false\r\n\r\nThe reason why this bug has not been triggered is that the parameter of [T3, T4] is [Long.Min, Long.Max], and the expression T3 <= T2 and T4 > T1 is always true. but if the input value changed, error may occur\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-08T11:18:55Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T08:49:44Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T08:49:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9108a500d932bdd3075b182e140ffc7e6ef19bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/pulls/2457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/pulls/2457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/2457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/statuses/b77f11d9a9b1a50fc46edd359d34446a21f4d735","head":{"label":"yuqi1129:work_1","ref":"work_1","sha":"b77f11d9a9b1a50fc46edd359d34446a21f4d735","user":{"login":"yuqi1129","id":15794564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk0NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15794564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqi1129","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":282203491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODIyMDM0OTE=","name":"incubator-iotdb","full_name":"yuqi1129/incubator-iotdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuqi1129","id":15794564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk0NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15794564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqi1129","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuqi1129/incubator-iotdb","description":"Apache

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache IoTDB be the best it can be! \r\nPlease fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it \r\nwhen irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n1. Now the CI print too many meaningless log, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/IOTDB/issues/IOTDB-1104\r\n2. Some error are just caused by incorrect SQL, they should not be marked as \"Server Internal Error\".\r\n\r\n3. Some RestartTests failed because the compaction module does not allow clear the MManamger before it is stopped.\r\nsee #2426  https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2426/checks?check_run_id=1650191463 and \r\n#2425  https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2425/checks?check_run_id=1649494523\r\n\r\n## How to fix\r\n\r\n1. I define a new Logger in TsserviceImple, called `DETAILED_FAILUER_QUERY_TRACE`, and use it to print the errors except for the NullException, Exception, and AuthException.\r\n\r\n2. The logger is in the `ERROR` level in Tests and the `WARN` level in `src/assembly`\r\n \r\n3. I replace many `System.out` and `printStackTrace` in Tests with `logger.debug`.\r\n\r\n4. Move  `IoTDB.metaManager.clear();` out of `IoTDB.shutdown`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error \r\n    conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, \r\n    design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design \r\n(or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented \r\n(or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere \r\n(e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), \r\nlink to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design \r\ncompared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. \r\nIf something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of \r\nthose aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability \r\nof this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n    - [x] concurrent read\r\n    - [x] concurrent write\r\n    - [x] concurrent read and write \r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. \r\n- [ ] added or updated version, __license__, or notice information\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious \r\n  for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold \r\n  for code coverage.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test IoTDB cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Switch Zeppelin connector from Session to JDBC\r\nPrevious implementation use `Session` to connect IoTDB, which has to judge whether someone SQL is a query or update.\r\nJDBC enables the zeppelin interpreter to pass the SQL to the server and then use `hasResultSet` to determine the result format. As a result, the zeppelin interpreter has supported `show timeseries` now.\r\n\r\n### Content1:  Session to JDBC\r\nThe functions related to connection, SQL parsing, and SQL result
