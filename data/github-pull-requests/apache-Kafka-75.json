Currently `SetSchemaMetadata` provide a way to transform the namespace by specifying in the `schema.name` attribute both actual namespace being concatenated with the actual schema name:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"transforms\" : \"TransformSchema\",\r\n  \"transforms.TransformSchema.type\" : \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.SetSchemaMetadata$Value\",\r\n  \"transforms.TransformSchema.schema.name\" : \"my.new.namespace.NewSchemaName\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut this way you are forced to specify the schema name even when you want to preserve the original schema name. In some cases you just may need to replace possibly an empty namespace of your source with the actual namespace fitting \"your.java.package\" and leave schema name as it is.\r\nMoreover as mentioned in [KAFKA-7883](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7883), when use JDBC connector with multiple tables in the source database what you may want is to preserve the table names but specify some non-empty namespace for them.\r\nTo support this we have to provide a way to append a schema namespace to the schema name (doesn't matter being updated or not).\r\nIn this PR a new `schema.namespace` attribute is added to `SetSchemaMetadata` letting developer to decide either to transform namespace only or transform both schema name and schema namespace by using either `schema.namespace` together with `schema.name` or just single `schema.name` attribute. An example:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"transforms\" : \"TransformSchema\",\r\n  \"transforms.TransformSchema.type\" : \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.SetSchemaMetadata$Value\",\r\n  \"transforms.TransformSchema.schema.namespace\" : \"my.new.namespace\",\r\n  \"transforms.TransformSchema.schema.name\" : \"NewSchemaName\",\r\n  \"transforms.TransformSchema.schema.version\" : 42\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-27T19:09:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T03:33:45Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T03:33:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kkonstantine","id":16238634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine","html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

PR takes all changes in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11350 that are needed for a Scala 3 compatibility except those with an open bug report or already solved one.\r\n\r\nThe PR is separated in 5 commits, one for each type of change performed:\r\n- Avoid Shadowing: Scala 3 compiler is not so friendly with shadowing and reports errors where Scala 2 wasn't.\r\n- Not rely on automatic widening in numeric types: Scala 3 doesn't automatically convert `Short` to `Int` or `Int` to `Long` at will as in Scala 2. Changes in here help the typer by manually forcing the conversions.\r\n- Remove redundant parenthesis: Scala 2 was more lax about calling with empty parenthesis a method without parenthesis. This became stricter in Scala 3.\r\n- Explicit type declaration: Scala 3 changed a bit in the area of type inference and in some cases it picks the most general type, causing in our case some trouble as this is not public but package protected.\r\nIn other cases, the typer wasn't able to infer the proper one, forcing it to be manually set.\r\n- Workaround for SAM conversion with overloading: This is a reported bug that unfortunately can't be fixed easily without breakage on Scala's side. For further information check lampepfl/dotty#13549\r\n\r\nThe resulting code is still Scala 2 valid code and arguably more correct.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing all the changes in an enormous PR with all the changes at once, we can already perform the changes we know for a fact that are going to be needed for Scala 3.\r\n\r\nIf desired I can provide 1 PR per commit.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-25T15:40:02Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T09:34:03Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T05:55:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79cb94e224730ba24408218e9b5a4a40c626068d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ddd25c6519166e90f3b1ca6552b343871e1d2245","head":{"label":"jlprat:KAFKA-13399-towards-scala3","ref":"KAFKA-13399-towards-scala3","sha":"ddd25c6519166e90f3b1ca6552b343871e1d2245","user":{"login":"jlprat","id":3337739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzc3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3337739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat","html_url":"https://github.com/jlprat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":365179290,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjUxNzkyOTA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"jlprat/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlprat","id":3337739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzc3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3337739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat","html_url":"https://github.com/jlprat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlprat/kafka","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10457/files#r635196307, the reviewer asked if there's a bug that we only check for zookeeper case, I didn't do a well check and directly confirm it. Now, after checking the change history, I found the change is because the [KIP-464](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-464%3A+Defaults+for+AdminClient%23createTopic) (PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6728) added default values for partition count and replica factor for createTopic in AdminClient. So it didn't apply for zookeeper option case. \r\n\r\nFix this bug and add tests for the command lines in quick start (i.e. create topic and describe topic), to make sure it won't be broken in the future.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10680, we added `fysnc` on dir to maintain crash consistency. But, it looks like Windows OS doesn't support `fsync` on directory. The same issues also happen on [LUCENE](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5588) and [HDFS](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-13586) projects. And the way they fix it is pretty much the same: to skip fsync directory on Windows OS. Here are the patches for both [LUCENE-5588](https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/apache/lucenenet/pull/43.patch) and [HDFS-13586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12924032/HDFS-13586.001.patch). \r\n\r\nI followed their way to fix this issue. No tests added since it's just an OS check added, no logic change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

ZooKeeperTestHarness to QuorumTestHarness so that integration tests which inherit from this\r\nclass can test both ZK and KRaft mode. Test cases which do this can specify the modes they support\r\nby including a ParameterizedTest annotation before each test case, like the following:\r\n\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n@valuesource(strings = Array(\"zk\", \"kraft\"))\r\ndef testValidCreateTopicsRequests(quorum: String): Unit = { ... }\r\n\r\nFor each value that is specified here (zk, kraft), the test case will be run once in the appropriate\r\nmode. So the test shown above is run twice. This allows integration tests to be incrementally\r\nconverted over to support KRaft mode, rather than rewritten to support it. As you might expect, test\r\ncases which do not specify a quorum argument will continue to run only in ZK mode.\r\n\r\nJUnit5 makes the quorum annotation visible in the TestInfo object which each @beforeeach function in\r\na test can optionally take. Therefore, this PR converts over the setUp function of the quorum base\r\nclass, plus every derived class, to take a TestInfo argument. The TestInfo object gets \"passed up\r\nthe chain\" to the base class, where it determines which quorum type we create (zk or kraft).\r\n\r\nThe general approach taken here is to make as much as possible work with KRaft, but to leave some\r\nthings as ZK-only when appropriate. For example, a test that explicitly requests an AdminZkClient\r\nobject will get an exception if it is running in KRaft mode. Similarly, tests which explicitly\r\nrequest KafkaServer rather than KafkaBroker will get an exception when running in KRaft mode.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of concept, this PR converts over MetricsTest to support

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9642, we removed the unnecessary `success` parameter, and use the `error` as the key to identify if the commit successfully or failed. That's a good improvement. However, there are some cases we passed `success` with `false`, but without `error` value. I think we should always pass the `error` value when failed. Fix it and add tests. After this fix, all `recordCommitFailure` call will always pass with an error. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

needs to honor `config.properties.exclude` property when it replicates initial/new topics. Updates to `MirrorSourceConnector` in 2.8 break exclude filter. Prior to 2.8, MM2 would create a topic in target cluster without any config applied. The TopicSync would apply the configuration, honoring exclude filter.\r\n\r\nBut in 2.8, the change has been made to create a topic on target with all the configurations from the source cluster. While doing that, no filters applied at all.\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that the same working logic filtering excluded properties is applied while creating new topics on target cluster.\r\n\r\nTesting Strategy:\r\n**Reproduce:**\r\n1. On Source cluster create topic \"Topic_Short_Retention\"\r\n2. Alter topic Topic_Short_Retention: `bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server <broker_host> --alter --entity-type topics --entity-name Topic_Short_Retention --add-config retention.ms=300000`\r\n3. include following line in MM2 config: `config.properties.exclude=follower.replication.throttled.replicas, leader.replication.throttled.replicas, message.timestamp.difference.max.ms, message.timestamp.type, unclean.leader.election.enable, min.insync.replicas, retention.ms`. *Note, I copied default exclude filter and added* `retention.ms` to it\r\n4. Start MM2 connector. *Note, the topic on a target cluster will have* `retention.ms` *copied from source cluster*.\r\n\r\n**Test the Fix:**\r\n1. Stop MM2 connector\r\n2. Apply patch\r\n3. Delete the topic from target cluster\r\n4. Start MM2 with configuration as described in step 3 of reproduction\r\n5. Check topic's retention config - it should be preserved as cluster's default and not copied from source cluster.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

PR implements the follower fetch protocol as mentioned in KIP-405.\r\n\r\nAdded a new version for `ListOffsets` protocol to receive local log start offset on the leader replica. This is used by follower replicas to find the local log star offset on the leader. \r\n\r\nAdded a new version for `FetchRequest` protocol to receive OffsetMovedToTieredStorageException error. This is part of the enhanced fetch protocol as described in KIP-405.\r\n\r\nWe introduced a new field `locaLogStartOffset` to maintain the log start offset in the local logs. Existing logStartOffset will continue to be the log start offset of the effective log that includes the segments in remote storage.\r\n\r\nWhen a follower receives OffsetMovedToTieredStorage, then it tries to build the required state from the leader and remote storage so that it can be ready to move to fetch state. \r\n\r\nIntroduced `RemoteLogManager` which is responsible for \r\n   - initializing `RemoteStorageManager` and `RemoteLogMetadataManager` instances.\r\n   - receives any leader and follower replica events and partition stop events and act on them\r\n   - also provides APIs to fetch indexes, metadata about remote log segments.\r\n\r\nFollowup PRs will add more functionality like copying segments to tiered storage, retention checks to clean local and remote log segments. This will change the local log start offset and make sure the follower fetch protocol works fine for several cases.\r\n\r\nYou can look at the detailed protocol changes in KIP:

are a few fixes included in this commit.\r\n1. When loading a snapshot the broker `BrokerMetadataListener` was using the batch's append time, offset and epoch. These are not the same as the append time, offset and epoch from the log. We must instead use the `lastContainedLogTimeStamp`, `lastContainedLogOffset` and `lastContainedLogEpoch` from the `SnapshotReader`.\r\n2. Include the highest offset and epoch into the `MetadataImage` and `MetadataDelta`. Adding the offset and epoch to `MetadataImage` is useful to version the image and to simplify the API. Adding the offset and epoch to `MetadataDelta` is needed to generate the `MetadataImage`.\r\n3.

ZooKeeperTestHarness to QuorumTestHarness so that integration tests which inherit from this\r\nclass can test both ZK and KRaft mode. Test cases which do this can specify the modes they support\r\nby including a ParameterizedTest annotation before each test case, like the following:\r\n\r\n>  @ParameterizedTest\r\n>  @ValueSource(strings = Array(\"zk\", \"kraft\"))\r\n>  def testValidCreateTopicsRequests(quorum: String): Unit = { ... }\r\n\r\nFor each value that is specified here (zk, kraft), the test case will be run once in the appropriate\r\nmode. So the test shown above is run twice. This allows integration tests to be incrementally\r\nconverted over to support KRaft mode, rather than rewritten to support it. As you might expect, test\r\ncases which do not specify a quorum argument will continue to run only in ZK mode.\r\n\r\nJUnit5 makes the quorum annotation visible in the TestInfo object which each @BeforeEach function in\r\na test can optionally take. Therefore, this PR converts over the setUp function of the quorum base\r\nclass, plus every derived class, to take a TestInfo argument. The TestInfo object gets \"passed up\r\nthe chain\" to the base class, where it determines which quorum type we create (zk or kraft).\r\n\r\nThe general approach taken here is to make as much as possible work with KRaft, but to leave some\r\nthings as ZK-only when appropriate. For example, a test that explicitly requests an AdminZkClient\r\nobject will get an exception if it is running in KRaft mode. Similarly, tests which explicitly\r\nrequest KafkaServer rather than KafkaBroker will get an exception when running in KRaft mode.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of concept, this PR converts over CreateTopicsRequestTest to support KRaft. This is a\r\ngood proof of concept because it is a very \"deeply nested\" test class (it has 5 base classes).\r\n\r\nSome notable changes in each file:\r\n\r\nKafkaServerTestHarness: add a \"brokers\" method, which replaces \"servers\" in KRaft-compatible tests.\r\nCreate KRaft brokers when configured to do so.\r\n\r\nBaseRequestTest: add KRaft implementations for functions to fetch various socket server objects.\r\n\r\nTestUtils: add KRaft-compatible versions of many utility functions.\r\n\r\nZooKeeperTestHarness: rename to QuorumTestHarness. Change the setUp function to take a TestInfo\r\nobject and configure the test appropriately (for KRaft or ZK) based on this.\r\n\r\nBrokerServer: lifecycleManager should be final and initialized in the constructor, so that the\r\nobject state is always available.\r\n\r\nKafkaBroker: add more accessor methods to this base class for the ZK and the KRaft broker.\r\n\r\nIntegrationTestHarness: set the controller endpoint when in KRaft mode.\r\n\r\nCreate TestInfoUtils to house utility functions for reading and writing TestInfo objects.\r\n\r\nReplicationControlManager.java: harmonize TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS error text with\r\nthe zk case.","created_at":"2021-10-05T21:20:50Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:09Z","closed_at":"2021-11-02T18:23:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c26198aa79d1f60378ae70829771dcaaea93b41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f28f8d36e73530c857c020785ebd1da96374fd0d","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-13340","ref":"KAFKA-13340","sha":"f28f8d36e73530c857c020785ebd1da96374fd0d","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

change allows Source Connectors the option to set \"error.tolerance\" to \"all\" to allow them to handle/ignore producer exceptions. In the event the producer cannot write to Kafka, the connector commitRecord() callback is invoked with null RecordMetadata. This is new behavior for the errors.tolerance setting. Default behavior is still to kill the task unconditionally if errors.tolerance is \"none\".\r\n\r\nA unit test has been added to validate the producer callback for failure being invoked. The sourceTask will ignore the exception and the task will not be killed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

forbid sending produce request before adding partitions in the txn in the following way:\r\n\r\n* In `Sender#runOnce`, we would not continue to `sendProducerData` as long as `maybeSendAndPollTransactionalRequest()` returns true.\r\n* Inside `maybeSendAndPollTransactionalRequest` as long as `!newPartitionsInTransaction.isEmpty()` we would enqueue an `AddPartitionsToTxn` request to the queue, so in normal cases `maybeSendAndPollTransactionalRequest` would return `true` which would forbid us to send produce request in that iteration.\r\n* One thing that caught my eyes however, is that inside `transactionManager.nextRequest(accumulator.hasIncomplete())` where we call `maybeTerminateRequestWithError(nextRequestHandler)`, if the state is already `hasAbortableError()` we would fail the request immediately and hence the caller would return `null`, in which case `maybeSendAndPollTransactionalRequest` would return false.\r\n* At the `Sender#runOnce()`, we only check `if (transactionManager.hasFatalError())` and if yes we would not proceed to send produce requests.\r\n\r\nSo I think there's a possible trace where we would send produce request before sending addPartitionsToTxn requests:\r\n\r\n1) First of all, the state of the transaction is already in `abortable error`.\r\n2) In `Sender#runOnce`, we would first pass `transactionManager.hasFatalError()` since we are not in `fatal error`\r\n3) And then in `maybeSendAndPollTransactionalRequest`, although we would generate an `addPartitionsToTxn` request, that request would fail immediately due to the `abortable error` state.\r\n4) And then we would pass `maybeSendAndPollTransactionalRequest` and continue to `sendProducerData` assuming the metadata for the destination brokers are available.\r\n\r\nIn this case, a producer request could be sent out while the addPartitionsToTxn request is failed. The effect of this happening is that the txn would \"hang forever\" since the txn marker may not be written to it ever while the txn is eventually aborted, but with the txn data appended to the partitions, it means LSO would not advance and all consumers / log compactors etc would be blocked.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

also fixes KAFKA-13070.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a problem caused by shutting down the scheduler before shutting down LogManager.\r\n\r\nWhen LogManager was closing partitions one by one, the scheduler called to delete old segments due to retention. However, the old segments could have been closed by the LogManager, which caused an exception and subsequently marked logdir as offline. As a result, the broker didn't flush the remaining partitions and didn't write the clean shutdown marker. Ultimately the broker took hours to recover the log during restart.\r\n\r\nThis PR essentially reverts https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10538\r\n\r\nI believe the exception https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10538 saw is at https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5a6f19b2a1ff72c52ad627230ffdf464456104ee/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LocalLog.scala#L895-L903 which called the scheduler and crashed the compaction thread.

PR lays the groundwork for the Scala3 migration of the code base. Gradle's Scala3 plugin is merged but not released yet (see [PR](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/18001)).\r\nDuring the migration I encountered 2 different bugs in Scala3, they are filed [here](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/13549) and [here](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/13572).\r\n\r\n# Types of changes done in this PR:\r\n* Shadowing variables or packages are now errors instead of Scala doing guess work. A fair amount of the changes done in this PR was disambiguation. These include:\r\n  * Parameter shadowing\r\n  * Shadowing among imports\r\n* Parenthesis-less methods called with parameters is not possible any more in Scala3\r\n* `SockerServer` extra classes were split into different files as Scala3 compiler was failing to find them when referenced in other classes in this same file.\r\n* `foreach` java collections method was not directly usable under Scala3, so I transformed it to the Scala collection's one (this might be another bug in Scala3, I need to investigate)\r\n* Scala3 fails to determine the right overload method when SAM is involved if types don't match exactly (a.k.a. bug https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/13549)\r\n* Scala3 companion object of a trait doesn't have the static forwarder methods, needed to reference the companion object \"old style\" (a.k.a. bug https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/13572)\r\n* Extra manual typing was needed occasionally as Scala3 is probably stricter than Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n# Compiling with Scala3\r\nIn order to test this locally one can run the following:\r\n\r\n`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-distribution-url=https://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/gradle-7.3-20210906222431+0000-bin.zip`\r\nAnd then the usual\r\n`./gradlew compileTestScala -PscalaVersion=3.0`\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nJackson is using \"2.13.0-rc2\" version as it's the one that contains Scala3 improvements, it's not really needed to successfully compile though.\r\n\r\nExtra information, Scala3 is compiling in \"Migration Mode\", meaning it outputs some warnings about deprecated and dropped features. See [Migration Mode](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/tooling-migration-mode.html) for further info.\r\nAll these warnings can be automatically fixed by the Scala compiler itself.\r\n\r\n# Current Problems\r\nSpotbugs is currently detecting 30 problems with Scala3, it works fine when compiling with Scala 2.13. This currently blocks the execution of core and streams tests. By excluding `spotbugs` tests can be run and some tests are still failing, I need to find out why is this. Tests run successfully in Scala 2.13. To exclude `spotbugs` run the following:\r\n`./gradlew test -x spotbugsMain -PscalaVersion=3.0`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
