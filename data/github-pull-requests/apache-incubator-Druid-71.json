PR fixes an issue introduced by #8196 with the `GroupByQueryToolchest` cache strategy method that pulls values from the cache and translates them back into `ResultRow`, where an omission of

All dimension positions other than the first index (which has the value of the last column), will have null values instead.\r\n\r\nPrior to this fix the added test would fail with

This change has been introduced by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6863. However this DNS resolution is now performed only one time by the clients. This is not a problem if all brokers have fixed IP addresses, however this is definitely an issue when Kafka brokers are run on top of Kubernetes. Indeed, new Kubernetes pods will receive another IP address, so as soon as all brokers will have been restarted clients won't be able to reconnect to any broker.\r\n\r\nCurrently only way to force re-resolution on the druid is side is by terminating kafka supervisors and resubmitting them, if you run a cluster ingesting from kafka on k8s\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nFix versions are available 2.1.1 and above, this PR updates it to

Description\r\n\r\nRename partition spec fields to be consistent across the various types (hashed, single_dim, dynamic). Specifically, use `targetNumRowsPerSegment` and `maxRowsPerSegment` instead of `targetPartitionSize` and `maxSegmentSize`. Consistent and clearer names are easier for users to understand and use.\r\n\r\nAlso fix various IntelliJ inspection warnings and doc spelling mistakes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is to resolve the release blocker by temporarily addressing the bug reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8481. The auto compaction will check `targetCompactionSizeBytes` with this PR. The real solution should be something better such as https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8489.\r\n\r\nIn the release notes, it should be mentioned that the auto compaction can get stuck if `maxRowsPerSegment` or `maxTotalRows` is set instead of `targetCompactionSizeBytes`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR adds support for using PostAggregators on Datasketches aggregators in SQL, by adding new SQL operators that accept quantile, HLL, and theta sketches.\r\n\r\nTo support this, the SQL system has been updated to allow operators to be converted into non-expression-based PostAggregators. This is accomplished by adding a new `PostAggregatorVisitor` class and adding new variants of the existing RexNode conversion methods that accept a post agg visitor.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not add support for all current sketch postaggregators (such as `DoublesSketchToCDFPostAggregator`) and the tuple sketch is currently not supported, I plan to  handle this in a follow on PR. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

 #8071\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis patch introduces `doubleMean` aggregation type to compute arithmetic mean of values in a column at query time.\r\n\r\nit works by keeping `sum` and `count` and in the end spitting `sum/count` as mean.\r\n\r\nI explored an alternate algorithm as mentioned in #8071 but did not implement that due to performance degradation observed. That could be added in future as a optional strategy in this aggregation type.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nAll the `*Aggregator*.java` classes and

Description\r\n\r\nIf an unhandled error occurs when curator is talking to ZooKeeper, _always_ exit the JVM in addition to stopping the lifecycle to prevent the process from being left in a zombie state (**NOTE:** Previously, exiting the JVM was a configurable option disabled by default and would be triggered when the curator max connection retries was exceeded).\r\n\r\nWith this change, BoundedExponentialBackoffRetryWithQuit is no longer needed as when curator exceeds the configured retries, it triggers its unhandled error listeners. A new \"connectionTimeoutMs\" CuratorConfig setting is added mostly to facilitate testing curator unhandled errors, but it may be useful for users as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

#8413\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis patch enables optimization to exploit limit push down in segment scan phase during V2 GroupBy query processing.\r\nAt a high level following changes are introduced.\r\n\r\n- `applyLimitPushDownToSegment` property is introduced to enable this optimization both at cluster and query level (`true` by default)\r\n- `GroupByQueryEngineV2.HashAggregateIterator.newGrouper()` is updated to return `LimitedBufferHashGrouper` when `query.isApplyLimitPushDown() == true`\r\n- `GroupByQueryEngineV2.GroupByEngineKeySerde` is updated to correctly implement `Grouper.BufferComparator bufferComparator()` and `Grouper.BufferComparator bufferComparatorWithAggregators(..)` methods.\r\n- A new method `Grouper.BufferComparator bufferComparator(int keyBufferPosition, @Nullable StringComparator stringComparator)` is added to `GroupByColumnSelectorStrategy`\r\n- Code related to creation of Grouper.BufferComparator from `RowBasedGrouperHelper` into a new class `GrouperBufferComparatorUtils` for reuse.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThis is a short patch removing unnecessary work done during execution of groupBy query with limit push down. When limit is pushed down to merge phase in the groupBy query processing , `aggregate(..)` is called for all aggregators whenever a new bucket is added to the underlying hash table. This is unnecessary when `sortHasNonGroupingFields=false` and newly added bucket did not find a place in the min-max-heap .  With `sortHasNonGroupingFields=false`, that row's position in overall ordering can never change so it is ok to skip the `aggregate(..)` calls. this improves performance for cases where you have large number of buckets with multiple complex aggregators.\r\n\r\nNo behavior change is introduced in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test
