work towards #8148 . There would be follow up PR to do same for other core aggregators once this is merged.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis patch adds handling of single/multi value column handling by double sum/min/max aggregators to do a best effort parsing string as double.\r\n\r\n`StringColumnDoubleAggregatorWrapper` and `StringColumnDoubleBufferAggregatorWrapper` classes are introduced that can wrap existing double aggregators to handle string columns. Both of the classes are used by `SimpleDoubleAggregatorFactory` to be used when input column is known to be of String type.\r\n\r\nCurrently it does not work if `fieldExpression` instead of `fieldName` is provided.

Description\r\n\r\nReorganize Travis CI jobs into smaller faster (and more) jobs. Add various\r\nmaven options to skip unnecessary work and refactored Travis CI job\r\ndefinitions to follow DRY.\r\n\r\nThe Travis CI jobs can now all complete in under 30 minutes:\r\n\r\n| Job | Before | After |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| compilation | 20-25 minutes | 7-10 minutes |\r\n| static analysis | 10-15 minutes | 5-10 minutes |\r\n| packaging | 30 minutes | 20 minutes |\r\n| unit test | 15-40 minutes | 10-15 minutes |\r\n| integration test | 30-45 minutes | 15-25 minutes |\r\n\r\n#### Detailed changes:\r\n\r\n.travis.yml\r\n- Refactor build logic to get rid of copy-and-paste logic\r\n- Skip static checks and enable parallelism for maven install\r\n- Split static analysis into different jobs to ease triage\r\n- Use \"name\" attribute instead of NAME environment variable\r\n- Split \"indexing\" and \"web console\" out of \"other modules test\"\r\n- Split 2 integration test jobs into multiple smaller jobs\r\n\r\nbuild.sh\r\n- Enable parallelism\r\n- Disable more static checks\r\n\r\ntravis_script_integration.sh\r\ntravis_script_integration_part2.sh\r\nintegration-tests/README.md\r\n- Use TestNG groups instead of shell scripts and move definition of jobs\r\n  into Travis CI yaml\r\n\r\nintegration-tests/pom.xml\r\n- Show elapsed time of individual tests to aid in future rebalancing of\r\n  Travis CI integration test jobs run time\r\n\r\nTestNGGroup.java\r\n- Use TestNG groups to make it easy to have multiple Travis CI\r\n  integration test jobs. TestNG groups also make it easier to have an\r\n  \"other\" integration test group and make it less likely a test will\r\n  accidentally not be included in a CI job.\r\n\r\nIT*Test.java\r\nAbstractITBatchIndexTest.java\r\nAbstractKafkaIndexerTest.java\r\n- Add TestNG group\r\n- Fix various IntelliJ inspection warnings\r\n- Reduce scope of helper methods since the TestNG group annotation on\r\n  the class makes TestNG consider all public methods as test methods\r\n\r\npom.xml\r\n- Allow enforce plugin to be run from command-line\r\n- Bump resources plugin version so that \"[debug] execute contextualize\"\r\n  output is correctly suppressed by \"mvn -q\"\r\n- Bump exec plugin version so that skip property is renamed from \"skip\"\r\n  to \"exec.skip\"\r\n\r\nweb-console/pom.xml\r\n- Add property to allow disabling javascript-related work. This property\r\n  is overridden in Travis CI to speed up the jobs.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.","created_at":"2019-08-05T17:07:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T16:07:42Z","closed_at":"2019-08-07T16:52:43Z","merged_at":"2019-08-07T16:52:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"05b44e3467b423be0cb2fd449d799241898fa5b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWhen using `statsd-emitter` with Dogstatsd, the Druid process/service name (e.g. broker/coordinator) is included in the metric name e.g. `druid.broker.jvm.gc.cpu`. For the same metric e.g. `jvm.gc.cpu`, multiple metric names will be generated (`druid.broker.jvm.gc.cpu`, `druid.coordinator.jvm.gc.cpu`, `druid.historical.jvm.gc.cpu`, etc).\r\n\r\n **Since we have multiple metric names it's harder to get statistics across all Druid process types.**\r\n\r\nThis PR intend to solve this issue by adding this new configuration:\r\n\r\n|property|description|required?|default|\r\n|--------|-----------|---------|-------|\r\n|`druid.emitter.statsd.dogstatsdServiceAsTag`|If `druid.emitter.statsd.dogstatsdServiceAsTag` is true, druid service (e.g. druid/broker, druid/coordinator, etc) is reported as a tag (e.g. `service:druid/broker`) instead of being included in metric name (e.g. `druid.broker.my_metric`).|no|false|\r\n\r\nSo when this `druid.emitter.statsd.dogstatsdServiceAsTag` is true, the resulting metric send would be `jvm.gc.cpu` as name with a tag `service:druid/broker`.\r\n\r\nIf needed, it can be combined with `druid.emitter.statsd.prefix` to add `druid` as prefix to get metric name like `druid.jvm.gc.cpu` instead of `jvm.gc.cpu`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of bugs in `CompactionTask` and `ParallelIndexSubTask`. In `CompactionTask`, the current running indexTask should be killed when the compactionTask is killed. In `ParallelIndexSubTask`, I think [this line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/task/batch/parallel/ParallelIndexSubTask.java#L433) should be in the synchronized block.\r\n\r\nTo reduce both of the possibility of mistakes and duplicate codes, I added a couple of helper methods to `AbstractBatchIndexTask`. I also removed the default implementation of `stopGracefully()` because it's now should be called properly for all production tasks.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nUpdate the maven dependency plugin to the latest version and fix all\r\nwarnings for unused declared and used undeclared dependencies in the\r\ncompile scope. Added new travis job to add the check to CI.

This second attempt changes the `scope` of several dependencies to `runtime` instead of removing them entirely.

Description\r\n\r\nSeveral bugs are found in the overshadowableManager. It could happen in various cases, but it was essentially the contract of the `State` of the atomicUpdateGroup was not respected properly. I updated its javadoc as below to make it more clear:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  /**\r\n   * There are 3 states for atomicUpdateGroups.\r\n   * There could be at most one visible atomicUpdateGroup at any time in a non-empty overshadowableManager.\r\n   *\r\n   * - Visible: fully available atomicUpdateGroup of the highest version if any.\r\n   *            If there's no fully available atomicUpdateGroup, the standby atomicUpdateGroup of the highest version\r\n   *            becomes visible.\r\n   * - Standby: all atomicUpdateGroups of higher versions than that of the visible atomicUpdateGroup.\r\n   * - Overshadowed: all atomicUpdateGroups of lower versions than that of the visible atomicUpdateGroup.\r\n   */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main bug fixes have been fixed in `determineVisibleAfterAdd()` and `determineVisibleAfterRemove()`.\r\n\r\nIn `determineVisibleAfterAdd()`, it should consider the following cases:\r\n\r\n1) The latest standby group should be visible if there is no full group.\r\n2) If an overshadowed group becomes full, it could be promoted to visible if there’s no full group overshadowing that overshadowed group.\r\n\r\nIn 2), we should check not only the fullness of the overshadowed group (let say `g1`), but also the fullness of sibling groups overshadowed by the same group which overshadows `g1`. 2) was not handled properly before.\r\n\r\n`determineVisibleAfterRemove()` is executed only when a visible chunk is removed, which means the current visible atomicUpdateGroup is not full anymore so we should check if there's any group we can fall back to. The group to fall back should be:\r\n\r\n1) The latest fully available atomicUpdateGroups in the overshadowed groups\r\n2) The latest standby groups\r\n3) The latest overshadowed groups if the current visible is empty\r\n\r\nOnly 1) was considered before.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

close the show log dialog the Timeout would continue to make network requests to get a task log. This is no longer the case. Additionally queries were made without a query manager which prompted the memory leak error. A query manager has been implemented to stop this. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nadded tail-query manager and a showlog query manager that handle the network request and the timeout respectively. This should protect against memory leaks as well as be consistent with the way queries work across the console.\r\n\r\nClears timeout in the component will unmount lifecycle hook. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the ability for most `DimFilter` implementations to control whether or not `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` will use a bitmap index while processing queries. I consider this to be laying the groundwork for allowing `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` the opportunity for more sophisticated decision making when deciding when to use bitmap indexes or not, but the first step of this is to enable easy experimentation so that we can shake out what good \"automatic\" decisions might be. \r\n\r\nThis PR is related to #3878, and replaces #6633, which was a more targeted attempt at something similar.\r\n\r\nThis is done by adding a new type, `FilterTuning`, which most `DimFilter` implementations will accept if specified in the filter json, which is supplied to all `Filter` implementations. The `Filter` interface itself has been modified with a few new methods:\r\n* `getRequiredColumns` which is analog to `DimFilter.getRequiredColumns`\r\n* `shouldUseIndex` which `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` and `FilteringOffset` call now instead of `supportsBitmapIndex` directly, to determine if a bitmap index should be used.\r\n\r\nAnd a static default implementation of `supportsBitmapIndex` supplied by `Filters` that currently all `Filter` implementations are using.\r\n\r\n`FilterTuning` currently has 3 properties:\r\n\r\n| property | type | description | default |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `useIndex`| boolean | allow manually skipping bitmap index even if it exists | true\r\n| `maxCardinalityToUseBitmapIndex ` | integer | allow using a bitmap index only if cardinality is _under_ max value| `Integer.MAX_VALUE` |\r\n| `minCardinalityToUseBitmapIndex ` | integer | allow using bitmap index only if cardinality is _over_ min value (this is probably useless, but i wanted levers to pull to see what happens). | 0 |\r\n\r\nSince this is an advanced feature intended primarily for experimentation, I am leaving it undocumented for now.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `Filter`\r\n* `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter`\r\n* `FilterTuning`\r\n*

of #7900 series of patches\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a small patch that makes the new CliIndexer incrementally more usable for experimental purposes while the more sophisticated memory management features described in proposal #7900 are still being developed.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the following:\r\n- A new WorkerConfig property `globalIngestionHeapLimitBytes`, which specifies a total limit for `maxBytesInMemory` across all the tasks being executed by a CliIndexer process. In this incremental patch, this limit is divided evenly across the configured worker capacity. The default is 60% of the JVM heap.\r\n- To help reduce overall memory usage while using the existing IndexMerger, the CliIndexer will limit merge/persist calls made by appenderators using a shared executor, with number of threads equal to half of the configured worked capacity.\r\n- WorkerConfig is moved into `server` package for accessibility\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-31T01:20:41Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T22:08:46Z","closed_at":"2019-08-01T02:22:41Z","merged_at":"2019-08-01T02:22:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"41893d46470b6dc0730f57c3176d28946b4fa662","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nNew druid expressions for filtering IPv4 addresses:\r\n- ipv4address_match: Check if IP address belongs to a subnet\r\n- ipv4address_parse: Convert string IP address to long\r\n- ipv4address_stringify: Convert long IP address to string\r\n\r\nThese expressions operate on IP addresses represented as either strings\r\nor longs. The filtering is more efficient when operating on IP addresses\r\nas longs. In other words, the intended use case is:\r\n\r\n1) Use ipv4address_parse to convert to long at ingestion time\r\n2) Use ipv4address_match to filter (on longs) at query time\r\n3) Use ipv4adress_stringify to convert to (readable) string at query\r\ntime\r\n\r\nA follow-up PR will add the equivalent SQL functions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

by the following flame graph, this patch attacks `HllSketchMergeBufferAggregator.init` by precomputing a single initialized sketch, and then copying that precomputed sketch into aggregation buffers. Before, this was done by calling `Unsafe.setMemory` (by way of `Memory.clear`).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1655\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1214075/62092710-0e042000-b22b-11e9-9385-54b6cd7d1de2.png\">\r\n\r\nOne interesting thing about this flame graph is that `Memory.clear` accounts for nearly 60% (!) of it. Of that, half is in the HllSketch constructor, which this patch attacks.\r\n\r\nThe rest is mostly `Union.update`, in particular two methods it calls: `DirectCouponHashSet.growHashSet`, and `DirectCouponList.promoteListToSet`. @leerho or @AlexanderSaydakov - for these two methods - any idea what size of memory would typically be cleared at once? We could potentially speed these up by using copyMemory instead of setMemory with some pre-zeroed chunks.\r\n\r\nJMH benchmarks (~5x speedup in

Description\r\nNow, druid offers the ability of getting accurate cardinality for dimension by nested group by query.\r\nIt can be described as follows conceptually:\r\nFor a sql like:\r\n```sql\r\nselect count(distinct pid) from DATASOURCE where col=\"val\"\r\n```\r\nthe exactly query will be like:\r\n```sql\r\nselect count(*) from (\r\n  select pid from DATASOURCE_segments_in_historical1 where col=\"val\" group by pid\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  select pid from DATASOURCE_segments_in_historical2 where col=\"val\" group by pid\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  select pid from DATASOURCE_segments_in_historical3 where col=\"val\" group by pid\r\n  ...\r\n) group by pid\r\n```\r\nFor high cardinality case, the size of result transfered from historical node to broker node can be really large and leads to poor performance.\r\nSo this extension try to use bitmap(64bit RoaringBitmap) as the container for the result data from the historical to reduce the data tranfered from historical to broker.\r\nThe performance can be 10 times better the nested group by method.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4433949/62921471-661a5500-bddb-11e9-91dd-300e8387741f.png)\r\n\r\nBut as there isn't globlal dictionary built in realtime ingestion, the PR can just support for single long dimension which can be put into bitmap directly.\r\n\r\nAnd add a ACCURATE_CARDINALITY() method in SQL like:\r\n```sql\r\nselect ACCURATE_CARDINALITY(pid) from DATASOURCE where col=\"val\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is after PR #6768.

than generally wanting to use the latest Curator and ZK, this change is motivated by an outage I encountered last night. I was debugging a cluster last night that was acting bizarrely, and in the end it turned out that it had two overlords that both thought they were leader. Shortly before they both gained leadership, the ZK quorum was unavailable for about 20 seconds. It doesn't look like Druid itself was doing anything particularly wrong: logs indicated the overlords weren't ignoring `stopBeingLeader` calls or anything like that.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I believe the cause of the outage was https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-498. This comment indicates the bug could cause two LeaderLatch users to become leaders at once:

for VersionedIntervalTimeline introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7547#issuecomment-511966275.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this benchmark is to measure how much slower VersionedIntervalTimeline is with segment lock than with timeChunk lock.\r\n\r\n### Data setup\r\n\r\nA synthetic segments were created to emulate the usual compaction scenario where initial segments are created and then they got compacted while new segments are appended. The benchmark first generates `numInitialRootGenSegmentsPerInterval` segments per interval. Then, it generates `numInitialRootGenSegmentsPerInterval * COMPACTED_SEGMENTS_RATIO_TO_INITIAL_SEGMENTS` compacted segments which overwrites the segments of the previous generation. It also generates new appending segments. This can be repeated more than once based on `numNonRootGenerations`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nAggregated `ResponseContext` keys into enum as a next step of [ResponseContext refactoring](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8110). Previously the keys were just static strings so theoretically there was no obstacle to use any string as a key of `ReponseContext`. This refactoring eliminates this possibility by introducing the enum of `ResponseContext` keys and exposing only methods requiring the enum instance as a key.\r\n#### Fixed the issue of merging `ResponseContext` instances returned by Historicals to Broker\r\nThere was no rule of merging different response contexts but from my point of view, the current solution of rewriting existing values by last ones is incorrect because of losing valuable information. For example, a value associated with the key `UNCOVERED_INTERVALS` contains a list of uncovered intervals and the result value is not the last returned but the concatenation of all returned lists. The same issue with the key `MISSING_SEGMENTS` (a list of missing segments) and `COUNT` (the number of scanned rows). Thus I decided to provide every key with a merge function. So response contexts merge became a simple procedure.\r\n\r\nAlso improved `ResponseContext` serialization. Previously the result of serialization was truncated if its length was greater than the limit. I believe it would be better to keep the context structure and make it deserializable thus the process of serialization removes max-length fields completely from the context until the final result length doesn't exceed the limit.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed classes is `ResponseContext`.","created_at":"2019-07-25T12:08:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T08:56:48Z","closed_at":"2019-08-03T09:05:22Z","merged_at":"2019-08-03T09:05:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f3162b85e269749bf0aa848f435409b3a1db8fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

#8142 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUpdate the `isRealtime` flag when a segment is dropped by a realtime task.\r\nIn `DruidSchema` added a check in `removeServerSegment()` when none of the replicas is a realtime server type, mark `isRealtime=0`.\r\nAdded unit test.\r\nThis is marked `incompatible` because the semantics of the `is_realtime` flag for a segment is changed, earlier a segment would be marked realtime, if any realtime task was serving the segment. It's now changed to that a segment would be marked realtime, if _only_ realtime task is serving the segment and if a historical starts serving the segment, it's realtime flag is 0 or false.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

of https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8061.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`PartitionsSpec` is a class to describe the secondary partitioning method for data ingestion, but is being used by only Hadoop tasks. For more consistent behavior and configuration, all task types should use the same `PartitionsSpec`.\r\n\r\n`PartitionsSpec` is the top interface and has one direct implementation, `DynamicPartitionsSpec`. `DynamicPartitionsSpec` is the new partitionsSpec and used by indexTask and kafka/kinesis IndexTasks.\r\n\r\n`DimensionBasedPartitionsSpec` is the child interface of `PartitionsSpec` and represents the partitionsSpec based on dimension values. It has two implementations of `HashedPartitionsSpec` and `SingleDimensionPartitionsSpec`. These partitionsSpecs are used if and only if perfect rollup is configured.\r\n\r\n~This PR is _backward-Incompatible_ for tasks which use `indexTuningConfig` (indexTask, compactionTask, and parallelIndexTask) because the JSON form of tuningConfig doesn't have `maxRowsPerSegment`, `maxTotalRows`, `numShards`, and `partitionDimensions` anymore. However, it still could read the old JSON format. It should be compatible for other task types.~\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#XXXX.\r\n\r\n(Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove the above line if there is no corresponding\r\nissue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request.)\r\n\r\n(If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers.)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDescribe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR.

PR is for https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8061 and based on https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8114.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`ShuffleDataSegmentPusher` is a dataSegmentPusher used for writing shuffle data in local storage. \r\n\r\n`ShuffleDataSegmentPusher` uses `IntermediaryDataManager` internally which coordinates the segment writes in a round-robin fashion per supervisor task across sub tasks. This is to fully utilize the local disk bandwidth for shuffle.\r\n\r\nThe middleManager and the indexer can use this. However, with the middleManager, each task uses a separate `IntermediaryDataManager` instance. This could potentially result in two issues:\r\n\r\n- The distribution of shuffle segments can be suboptimal across local storage locations.\r\n- `IntermediaryDataSegment` needs to smoosh segment files into larger ones to avoid \"too many open files\" problem. This could also be an issue if there are a lot of tasks since `IntermediaryDataSegment` can't smoosh files across tasks with middleManager.\r\n\r\nI think this would be ok for now and could be improved if required in the future. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.","created_at":"2019-07-19T23:39:20Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T22:10:54Z","closed_at":"2019-08-05T20:38:36Z","merged_at":"2019-08-05T20:38:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab5b3be6c61d7be540f85385327a6a6489b363b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nHistoricals can use multiple threads to load segments in parallel from deep storage now (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7088, https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/4966). This could lead an incorrect computation of remaining space in `StorageLocation`.\r\n\r\nThe current pattern to use `StorageLocation` is:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (location.canHandle(segment)) {\r\n  // load segment files into the location\r\n  location.addSegment(segment);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though each of `canHandle()` and `addSegment()` is synchronized, they are not atomically executed which could lead a wrong estimation of the available space.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem to add a new method, `reserve()`, to `StorageLocation`. `reserve()` basically does what `canHandle()` and `addSegment()` atomically. If some error occurs after `reserve()`, the caller should call `remove(segment)` to release the reserved space.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the

default deserializer as org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArrayDeserializer.  Also added checks to ensure that any provided deserializer class extends org.apache.kafka.serialization.Deserializer and outputs a byte array.\r\n\r\n### Background Information:\r\nI was attempting to set up a kafka supervisor that uses MessagePack for serialization and de-serialization when I discovered that the Druid Kafka indexer only supports the ByteArrayDeserializer, which is also hard-coded.  Given that I have no control over the format of the data that I am ingesting (coming from external provider), I needed to be able to support a custom Kafka deserializer.\r\n\r\nAfter conversations on Slack with @vogievetsky and @gianm , they suggested that it would be a relatively simple feature to add, so long as the custom deserializer outputs a Byte array as is expected by the Kafka indexer.\r\n\r\nAs a new feature, this will maintain the old behavior as the default (ByteArrayDeserializer) when a user does not supply a key/value deserializer within the ingestionSpec, therefore making backward compatibility seamless while supplying an additional option to users in the same situation I found myself in with regards to not being able to ingest data through the Kafka Indexer for arbitrary serialization/deserialization

Description\r\nThe PR is a refactoring of a response context integrated into query processing via \r\n`QueryRunner.run(QueryPlus<T> queryPlus, Map<String, Object> responseContext)` method. \r\nThe response context is a map holding different values associated with different keys. It is used not only for passing values between the chains of query runners but also between historicals and brokers (see QueryResource.post method). Thus I believe it is important to know what the context is holding actually. There is no such way, putting values into a response context is distributed among different classes without documentation.\r\nThe refactoring is a separation a response context into a structure with all the keys which are used currently. So it's very easy to find what might be stored in the context. I decided to keep the current logic as much as possible to shorten the PR and simplify a review.\r\n1. Response context has a delegate that is a Map as previously\r\n2. There are different implementations of ReponseContext: HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap as a delegate - according to existing logic.\r\n3. ResponseContext is still the second parameter of `QueryRunner.run` method. \r\n4. ReponseContext keys are strings as previously. So tests used dummy keys are not updated and still have these dummy strings.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes in this PR are `ResponseContext`, `DefaultResponseContext`, `ConcurrentResponseContext`.","created_at":"2019-07-19T13:55:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T21:49:14Z","closed_at":"2019-07-24T15:29:04Z","merged_at":"2019-07-24T15:29:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"799d20249fe6333ea86b020f6d09c91fa4d3f998","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

part of implementation for #7900 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the initial foundation for the work in #7900:\r\n- A new Indexer process type is added, running on port 8091 like MiddleManagers.\r\n- This process type is like MM but uses a new ThreadingTaskRunner, which runs Tasks using a thread pool instead of forking processes\r\n- A new interface, `AppenderatorsManager`, which creates and manages Appenderators for tasks, has been added. The AppenderatorsManager for the new Indexer process uses a shared query execution pool and per-datasource segment walkers/imelines for the Appenderators it creates.\r\n- The TaskReportWriter has been adjusted to support managing multiple tasks\r\n- The new Indexer process serves requests on a single port, but divides the HTTP connection pool into 3 parts: one pool of connections for chat handler requests, one pool of connections for non chat handler requests, and 2 reserved connections for lookup listening. Each of the first two pools is sized to `druid.server.http.numThreads`. The distinct connection pooling is handled through Jetty QoS filters.\r\n- Lookups are loaded once for the entire Indexer process\r\n\r\nNo additional memory management for the tasks is present in this PR, they will use whatever has been configured in their task specs with no additional external control.\r\n\r\nThe new process is not currently exposed in the docs, as this is an intermediate PR and the process is not ready for use yet.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.","created_at":"2019-07-18T22:20:13Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T17:30:24Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T00:06:34Z","merged_at":"2019-07-30T00:06:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"640b7afc1cee911a27de7bf938dda24a85ba1510","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis fixes a null pointer exception that occurs in numerous places when polling for segments while having an empty metadata database after the changes of #7653. I'm not certain if this is the _correct_ fix since previously the snapshot would remain null until there were segments available during a poll, but it resolves the issue for me at least, and doesn't appear to have any ill side-effects.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-07-18T20:48:10,597 WARN [qtp265052195-81] org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpChannel -

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.-->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a benchmark for `CachingClusteredClient` and some refactoring of the query processing pipeline to provide the foundation for testing approaches to parallel broker merges.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks can be run with a command like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -Ddruid.benchmark.cacheDir=./tmp/benches/ -jar benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar org.apache.druid.benchmark.query.CachingClusteredClientBenchmark\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubstituting benchmark cache directory as appropriate. This benchmark could potentially be improved in the future to precompute the results to merge and strictly measure the merge, but for now I am retaining the overall approach of the original from #6629.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nI'm having a go at parallel broker merges, making another attempt to achieve the goals of #5913 and #6629, eventually planning to attempt the `ForkJoinPool` in `asyncMode` approach suggested by @leventov in [this thread](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6629#discussion_r241089247). Before that, in order to untangle things a bit, I've taken the benchmarks from #6629 (credit to @jihoonson) and updated/simplified them to take advantage of some of the changes to `SegmentGenerator` from #6794, to allow a persistent cache for the generated benchmark segments for much faster benchmarking. I've also extracted some of the useful refactorings and got a bit more adventurous. This should help isolate these supporting changes from any future PR which adds parallel merging, reducing review overhead.\r\n\r\n#### Refactoring\r\n\r\n##### `CombiningFunction<T>`\r\nAdded `CombiningFunction<T>`, a new `@FunctionalInterface` to replace `BinaryFn<Type1, Type2, OutType>`, since all actual usages were of the form `BinaryFn<T, T, T>` and being strictly used in merging sequences/iterators/iterables, etc.\r\n\r\n##### `QueryToolChest` and `ResultMergeQueryRunner`\r\nIn order to split out the mechanisms useful during merge from the merge implementation, `QueryToolChest` now has 2 additional functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCombiningFunction<ResultType> createMergeFn(Query<ResultType> query)\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nOrdering<ResultType> createOrderingFn(Query<ResultType> query)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor group-by queries, `GroupByStrategy` also has these method signatures, since `GroupByQueryToolchest` is delegating these things to the strategy.\r\n\r\nThese methods are passed into a refactored, non-abstract `ResultMergeQueryRunner`, as function generators, that given a `Query` produce either a `CombiningFunction` or `Ordering` respectively.\r\n\r\n##### ~`ConnectionCountServerSelectorStrategy` is now `WeightedServerSelectorStrategy`~\r\n~I did not refactor `QueryableDruidServer` in quite the same manner as #6629, but I did still modify `QueryableDruidServer` and `QueryRunner` to add a `getWeight` method, as suggested by @drcrallen in [this comment thread](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6629#discussion_r240789022) to make the selector strategy a bit more generic instead of hard casting `QueryRunner` to a `DirectDruidClient` to get the number of connections. I'm sort unsure about this one, this refactor might have made a bit more sense in the context of the changes to `QueryableDruidServer` in #6629, but I still think it's maybe worth doing?~ I reverted this change since it felt sort of artificial at this point, in favor of doing something like this when we actually need it.\r\n\r\n#### Removed\r\n`OrderedMergingIterator`, `OrderedMergingSequence`, and `SortingMergeIterator` have been removed, since they were strictly used by their tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-16T10:32:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T21:45:12Z","closed_at":"2019-07-18T20:16:29Z","merged_at":"2019-07-18T20:16:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"03e55d30ebcac9ec97edb1a638a5a99886c41374","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a forbidden-api rule to forbid using `Class.getCanonicalName` in favor of `Class.getName` since the latter will not return null for anonymous types.\r\n\r\nOne minor

me.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `ForkingTaskRunner.shutdown` to behave in the same manner as `ForkingTaskRunner.stop`, which closes the output stream to the forked task instead of calling destroy directly, which retains the log output on that stream allowing it to be fully written before terminating the task. ~I am unable to definitively determine if this means the task is not waiting for lifecycle stop to complete, or if it's strictly a logging issue, as I have collected conflicting observations.~ This appears to be strictly a logging issue.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nWhile looking into #8075 and #7962, noticed that the task logs stop abruptly when `ForkingTaskRunner.shutdown` is called, with an exception appearing in the middle-manager logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-07-13T05:13:10,009 INFO [forking-task-runner-0] org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner - Logging task index_wikiticker_2019-07-13T05:13:09.860Z output to:

Stalebot exemption labels\r\nThis PR greatly extends the list of labels which are exempt for stalebot. The only labels which are *not* exempt are:\r\n\r\n- `Backport`\r\n- `Difficulty - *`: not used these days, old issues should be revised\r\n- `Discuss`\r\n- `duplicate`\r\n- `Feature/Change Description`: no consensus has been reached regarding this label in the discussion in the mailing list\r\n- `Feature`: no consensus has been reached regarding this label in the discussion in the mailing list\r\n- `Flaky test`: tests tend to become less flaky in time, so these issues should be revised\r\n- `invalid`\r\n- `Priority - *`: not used these days, old issues should be revised\r\n- `Question`\r\n- `Release Notes`\r\n- `WIP`\r\n- `wontfix`\r\n\r\n#### Stalebot closing timeout\r\n\r\nI've changed the timeout to 28 days for both PRs and issues. I don't see why there should be a difference between PRs and issues. 14 days feels like a too short period. Stale issues and PRs don't block anybody, so there should be no hurry with closing them.\r\n\r\n#### Added `Uncategorized problem report` label in \"Problem report\" template\r\n\r\n#### Use \"label\" instead of \"tag\" term in `committer-instructions.md`\r\n\r\n\"Label\" is the official Github term.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been
