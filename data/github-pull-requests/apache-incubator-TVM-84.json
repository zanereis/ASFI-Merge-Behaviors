GPUs have a limit of 64K.

However, I don't know how to do that without impacting the performance. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.\r\n\r\nAlso, would it make sense to move `get_cuda_arch()` to a different file so that it can be used as a helper function in other parts of TVM codebase?

found a cool bug from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7572: It only works when pushconstants are one or more 64 bit values. https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7572 didn't change the codegen but load offset needs to be adjusted for 32 bit values (since all pushconstants occupy 64 bit after https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7572). In particular, dynamic shape workload requires passing the shape size as 32 bit pushconstants, so currently VK/SPIR-V backend is completely broken for dynamic shape. \r\n\r\nI updated load offset calculation and now dynamic shape started working with VK/SPIR-V.  Dynamic shape sort, which involves mixed 32 and 64 bit pushconstants, is also working using a patch from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7607. But one test I added, dynamic cumsum, is still not working for some reason. \r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @vinx13 I'm not sure if Metal backend has this

PR adds `simulated_quantize` and `simulated_dequantize` to the QNN library in relay. These operators are primarily meant to support the pass-based quantization framework proposed [in this Discuss post](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-quantization-quantization-in-tvm/9161). However, these new ops can be cleanly broken into their own PR and can be useful for other applications. The obvious benefit of simulated qnn ops is that they mimic real quantization in floating point. The more interesting benefit of this approach is that it allows switching between per-channel and scalar QNN parameters and changing the datatype **without recompilation**. This has major compute time benefits when doing calibration or eventually trying to do quantization aware training.\r\n\r\nI also found that using qnn quantize and dequantize with per-channel parameters and negative axes caused an error and fixed it and changed a test case to catch it going

patch refactors a number of tutorials, and adds additional documents, to create a Getting Started with TVM Tutorial. The aim of the tutorial is to guide a new user of TVM through the features and architecture of the project. It starts with a basic overview of TVM, followed by some guidance on how to install TVM.\r\n\r\nIt then works through examples of how to optimize a ResNet-50v2 models, using TVMC and the Python interface. Having given a high level example of what TVM is capable of, it then takes a bottom-up approach of describing TE using vector addition and matrix multiplication, then continues to build on the matrix multiplication example to describe templates, AutoTVM, and Auto Scheduling. Finally, some additional information about targeting GPUs and RPCs is described.","created_at":"2021-03-08T22:52:49Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T23:31:52Z","closed_at":"2021-03-17T21:11:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df41eff085f18a3258765abdbfdfd239c2473cfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

on @masahi's work to add a while loop to TIR, this PR implements the [MergePath](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2628) algorithm to parallelize the later stages of mergesort. It also implements a stable in-shared-memory odd-even sort to do small block sorting before mergesort for better speed. All told, this optimization gives us dramatic speedups on both AMD and Nvidia GPUs and trades blows with our thrust implementation for many shapes, see below. cc @Laurawly @zhiics @icemelon9

if a graph module returned nested tuples (which end up being flattened per #6809), the GraphExecutor would not unflatten the result and instead naively returned only the first `k` of the flattened outputs (where `k = original top-level tuple size`).

thanks!","created_at":"2021-03-05T14:31:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T17:51:08Z","closed_at":"2021-03-08T17:50:57Z","merged_at":"2021-03-08T17:50:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc7f8dc2f4b2492872a3e56365a3cca07997ed97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/229a9e73d3f0400708c212bf5e8c555f573f5ec5","head":{"label":"leeexyz:main","ref":"main","sha":"229a9e73d3f0400708c212bf5e8c555f573f5ec5","user":{"login":"leeexyz","id":7345156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDUxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7345156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz","html_url":"https://github.com/leeexyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167013814,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjcwMTM4MTQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"leeexyz/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leeexyz","id":7345156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDUxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7345156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz","html_url":"https://github.com/leeexyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeexyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leeexyz/tvm","description":"Open

spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpTypeBool) says we cannot physically address boolean buffers, but right now we are generating code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%_runtimearr_bool = OpTypeRuntimeArray %bool\r\n...\r\n%_ptr_StorageBuffer_bool = OpTypePointer StorageBuffer %bool\r\n...\r\n         %36 = OpInBoundsAccessChain %_ptr_StorageBuffer_bool %16 %int_0 %24\r\n         %37 = OpLoad %bool %36 None\r\n```\r\nThis is generating garbage outputs. Actually we hit an error at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1831c17998b29f3797f364410980809bfef554ca/src/target/spirv/ir_builder.cc#L130-L131 so boolean buffers are not supported at all.\r\n\r\nI updated SPIR-V codegen to make a char buffer when the input is a bool tensor, and add cast to bool after loading the char.\r\n\r\nIf this change looks good, I should probably update the visitor for

doesn't allow a graph to use the same nodes as both an input and output, nor does it allow an output to be marked as an output multiple times.\r\n\r\nIt seems there are still some corners cases where the partitioning can make these subgraphs which would cause TRT to crash at runtime during graph build. This PR will prevent the crash and allow the model to execute properly. I think it's good to have this in place in case there are more issues with partitioning we aren't aware of yet.\r\n\r\nI will make a separate PR to fix the partitioning bug I have found.

adds Vitis AI as a composite target to TVMC. As we need access to the CLI options in the partitioning function for the Vitis AI target, this PR updates the TVMC compiler and tuner interface to pass those options to the partitioning functions. The Arm Compute Lib and Ethos-N partitioning functions are adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\nI think we should document the use of these targets but not sure what the best place is. For example, we can add documentation to https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/get_started/tvmc_command_line_driver.html or in the target deploy and integration documentation (for example here: https://tvm.apache.org/docs/deploy/vitis_ai.html). Or we can do both?\r\n\r\n**CI**\r\nThe following PR should be merged first for tests to pass: https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7575\r\n\r\n@leandron @comaniac @mbaret

PR deals with the case that we may want to extract tuning tasks from a JIT model that compiles each subgraph when first time executing the model graph. In this case, we need at least one valid schedule (for GPU) to make sure we can visit the whole graph and collect all tasks, but this may not be the case especially for the backward model.\r\n\r\nThe above puzzle forms a chicken egg problem -- we don't have valid schedules so we need to extract tasks to tune, but we need at least one valid schedule in order to extract tasks. This PR solves this puzzle by sampling one valid schedule during task extraction:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    env_sample = auto_scheduler.ApplyHistoryBestOrSample(\"temp.log\", num_measure=2)\r\n    env_tracing_task = auto_scheduler.relay_integration.TracingEnvironment(\r\n        auto_scheduler.relay_integration.TracingMode.EXTRACT_COMPLEX_TASK_ONLY\r\n    )\r\n    with env_sample:\r\n        with env_tracing_task:\r\n            # Run the JIT model.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is once we found that there's no valid schedule of the task being collected, we immediately sample a valid schedule and use it for the current subgraph. In this way, we guarantee the graph can be visited from beginning to the end.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy

PR makes a few changes to make the structure of the uTVM code more user-friendly:\r\n\r\n* Migrates the Zephyr runtime code from tests/micro/qemu/zephyr-runtime to apps/microtvm/zephyr/demo_runtime\r\n   (to indicate that this runtime is more generally useful, but still intended as a \"demo\")\r\n* Makes board-specific `prj.conf` files for the demo_runtime, to allow different options to be configured for qemu_x86 and nrf5340 (for example).\r\n* Adds a test to `test_zephyr.py` which converts and tests an ONNX MNIST model\r\n* Adds a tutorial using the same ONNX MNIST model\r\n* Adds some more README files to explain the purpose of each

happy to start upstream TensorIR from this PR. \r\nTensorIR is a new low-level IR with full scheduling support. Each schedule primitive is a transformation from IR to IR. To get more detailed information please refer to the previous RFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-tensorir-a-schedulable-ir-for-tvm/7872. \r\n\r\nSince this project is large, we'd like to upstreaming with several PRs, full progress tracking should be here https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7527:\r\n- Introduce core data structure (this PR)\r\n- Add tvmscript support for TensorIR data structure\r\n- Introduce basic schedule state\r\n- Add schedule primitives one by one\r\n\r\nco-authors: @spectrometerHBH @junrushao1994 @tqchen @jinhongyii @MasterJH5574 and @vinx13

is a staged removal of the use of compile engine. The motivation is to bring TIR compilation into the main flow of the compiler rather than producing and compiling it via a callback into the compile engine. By replacing Relay primitive function calls with TIR prim function calls that contain the lowered TIR we enable, \r\n- An intermediate stage in the lowering process where Relay and TIR coexist. \r\n- The ability to add passes at this intermediate stage, \r\n    - For example memory planning which can infer user provided information from TE and the resulting TIR. \r\n\r\nWe are starting with a proof of concept by refactoring the GraphRuntimeCodegen to use an introduced TIR/TE compiler instead of the compile engine directly. In the new flow, \r\n- The TE/TIR compiler lowers TE in the LowerTensorExpr pass \r\n- Replaces relay.Function(attr:primitive) with a PrimFnCall that contains the lowered TIR\r\n- Runs GraphPlanMemory\r\n- Finally runs GraphRuntimeCodegen::VisitExpr to lower to graph JSON\r\n\r\n[[RFC][Relay] TECompiler: Rewrite existing compile engine to match updated compiler
