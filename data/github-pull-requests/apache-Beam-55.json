#26602\r\n\r\nSince May 8, Jenkins slave nodes can no longer access to the LDAP server and seed job permared since them. In addition to that, LDAP no longer hosts beam committers' GitHub usernames (https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA/issues/INFRA-24579?filter=allopenissues). This PR removes the changes made in #12407 and brings seed job back green.\r\n\r\nFor now, unless manually populate Committer.groovy, comment trigger will not work for the following jobs:\r\n- seed_00_job\r\n- seed_job_standalone\r\n- beam_Publish_Docker_Snapshots\r\n- beam_Dependency_Check\r\n- beam_Metrics_Report\r\n\r\nthe latter 3 defined `enablePhraseTriggeringFromPullRequest(prPermitAll=false)`\r\n\r\nCommitters can still trigger these jobs against a PR via Jenkins UI. The steps is:\r\n\r\n- In https://ci-beam.apache.org/ choose the task to run, in Configure tab, Add Parameter -> Add String parameter, add a parameter named `ghprbPullId` and Save\r\n- In Build with Parameters tab, fill sha1 with `origin/pr/4001/head` and ghprbPullId as `4001` then build.\r\n\r\nNote that this method build the seed job directly from the PR branch, not that the PR branch merged onto master (as the triggers originally did). So rebase onto the latest master before running the seed job is recommended\r\n\r\nWe may still want to find a new way to fetch committer github user names. However the recommendation in https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA/issues/INFRA-24579?filter=allopenissues (INFRA provided a relay to pass the trigger to Jenkins GitHub hook only the author is committer) does not quite fit the current workflow\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added Support for generating throughput, watermark progress & latency metric emission for GBK translator \r\n- Throughput Metrics are emitted for input (SamzaInputGBKMetricOp) and output throughput (SamzaOutputGBKMetricOp)\r\n- Watermark Progress Metrics are emitting at the during-process watermark of output\r\n- Latency Metrics are emitted by collecting avg arrival time at input & output for each transform using formula \r\n\r\n> Latency = Avg Arrival Time of Elements at Output per windowId- Avg Arrival Time of Elements at Input per windowId\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n\r\n- Added functional tests to test SamzaTransformMetricRegistry (SamzaInputGBKMetricOp and SamzaOutputGBKMetricOp)\r\n- Added end-to-end tests for Metric Compute & Emission\r\n- All existing runners tests (samza:validateRunner) case pass\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26234\r\n\r\nThe intension of this PR is to fix the [GitHub Actions postcommit dashboard](http://metrics.beam.apache.org/d/80hUcTh4k/ga-post-commits-status?orgId=1) that  was added in this PR [#24176](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/24176).\r\n\r\nAs a result, the following changes have been added:\r\n\r\n- Fixed the dashboard's json file schema to display data\r\n- Changed the [datasource](https://github.com/apache/beam/compare/master...akvelon:beam:26234-fix_github_actions_postcommit_dashboard?expand=1#diff-94218231238a6cf88ca8882ee3a497945acb8c796656e8e1c53741fe42ce59d2R44) to the `BeamPSQL` specified in the [beampostgresql.yaml](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.test-infra/metrics/grafana/provisioning/datasources/beampostgresql.yaml#L24) file in order to fetch data from PostgreSQL\r\n- Changed env variable names to be consistent with the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.test-infra/metrics/docker-compose.yml#L85-L87) file\r\n- The [github_actions_workflows_dashboard_sync](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/details/us-central1/github_actions_workflows_dashboard_sync?env=gen1&project=apache-beam-testing&tab=source) function is updated to be consistent with the implementation\r\n- The [github_actions_workflows_dashboard_sync](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler/jobs/edit/us-central1/github_actions_workflows_dashboard_sync?project=apache-beam-testing) job scheduler is enabled\r\n\r\n### How has it been tested?\r\n\r\nTested on the local machine.\r\n\r\n1. Update the `sync_workflows.py` script by adding an entry point:\r\n```\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    githubWorkflowsGrafanaSync(None, None)\r\n```\r\n2. Follow the [instruction](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Community+Metrics#CommunityMetrics-GrafanaUI) to deploy and configure a Grafana instance locally\r\n3. Go to the `beamsyncgithub` container: `docker exec -it \"beamsyncgithub\" bash`\r\n4. Pull out data from GitHub by running the sync script `python ./sync_workflows.py`\r\n5. Go to the `GA Post-Commits Status` Grafana dashboard and verify that data is displayed\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/beam/assets/38127224/b28d4b13-94d9-4662-a260-0b46dee2d5f8)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Kafka Transform has two control flows depending on how you provide the schema and it takes different logical paths based on that.\r\n\r\n* Explicit Schema: The KafkaIO reader reads the source data and deserializes it as bytes and then applies a mapper fn to map it to the schema. In case of schema mismatch records can fail during the mapping and can be rerouted to a dlq.\r\n\r\n* Confluent Schema Registry Url: The KafkaIO reader reads the source data and deserializes it using the schema and creates GenericRecords. In case of schema mismatch records fail during the read operation. These records will have to rerouted in the I/O.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the first mode of operation. I have added dlq support in the Kafka Read schema transform by tagging with an appropriate TupleTag and a Counter to keep track of the number of failed elements in a bundle.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Beam's file-based read IOs include filepattern info in the PTransform `DisplayData` ([AvroIO](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/f1e95970ca4cb9f4ed9099761ba6a757099d22d8/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/AvroIO.java#L749-L750),

doesn't have this functionality. Setting an input source works a bit differently with Hadoop compared to other IOs -- you set it in the config, like: `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat.setInputPaths(Job.getInstance(conf), \"file://my-path.txt\")`. So, this change displays that config entry if it's non-null.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
