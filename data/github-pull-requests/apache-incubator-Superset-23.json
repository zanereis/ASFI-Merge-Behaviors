For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus‚Äôs FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin‚Äôs excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there‚Äôs a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¶ and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin‚Äôs excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there‚Äôs a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¶ and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher.

the previous practice involves auto auto populate database (stored in local storage) into the newly created dataset, which will create bugs when database name changes, database is deleted, or when database meta is changed.\r\n- the practice of saving and fetching latest modified database through localStorage is a potentially technical debut, making it easy to introduce regression that cannot be tracked. looking to potential bugs next.\r\n**BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF**\r\nstale database data in localStorage\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/25937657/b481506e-691b-40fa-889f-18562d9945c9)\r\n\r\n**after fix

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently when there is 1 temporal filter added and user tries to remove it, we display a message saying that there must be at least 1 temporal filter in the chart. We use the same flow regardless if the filter has a value or not, so simply clearing the filter requires many additional clicks.\r\nThis PR improves that behaviour:\r\n- if there's more than 1 temporal filter, remove the filter on \"x\" click\r\n- if there's 1 temporal filter and it has a value other than \"No filter\", set the value to \"No filter\" on \"x\" click\r\n- if there's 1 empty temporal filter, display a warning message\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/ba3897ab-3005-4e9e-9d9a-47e9ebd8e29c\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to explore and add 2 or more temporal filters with some values\r\n2. Delete all but the last one\r\n3. Try to delete the last one - instead of being removed, the filter should clear its value\r\n4. Try to delete it again - a warning message should be displayed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR makes default logging work as expected:\r\n- Fixes duplicate logging.\r\n- Allows `DEBUG` level logging in production.\r\n- Makes logging respect `LOG_LEVEL` and `LOG_FORMAT` in config.\r\n- ~~Sets the `LOG_LEVEL` to `INFO` to match what we currently hardcode (theoretically a breaking change.)~~\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the initial goals were but by default we are logging `DEBUG` level everything but `superset`, which is set to `INFO` level (without regard to `LOG_LEVEL`,) and logging `superset` a second time without regard to the `LOG_FORMAT` config setting. This doesn't seem desirable for anybody.\r\n\r\nThis change makes default logging work as expected.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21646\r\nI think also resolves https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4785\r\n\r\n#### Cause of duplicate logging:\r\n\r\nPython loggers output via handlers, the issue is we are adding handlers twice, once here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/c0f8dfc7f99a0e83a8c9b3c083288c76f50aa662/superset/utils/logging_configurator.py#L50\r\n\r\nAnd unintuitively also when we call logging.basicConfig() which by default adds a StreamHandler on root:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/c0f8dfc7f99a0e83a8c9b3c083288c76f50aa662/superset/utils/logging_configurator.py#L55\r\n\r\nMinimum reproduction of the bug:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import logging\r\n>>> # No need to set BasicConfig, as logging.lastResort will be used by default\r\n>>> logging.basicConfig()\r\n>>> logging.warning('test')\r\nWARNING:root:test\r\n>>> sublogger = logging.getLogger('sublogger')\r\n>>> sublogger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())\r\n>>> sublogger.warning('test')\r\ntest\r\nWARNING:sublogger:test\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nInspect startup log messages, trigger a log if need be.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

through the code to try to track down a potential issue with access checks I realized there were two methods named `check_datasource_access`:\r\n\r\n1. [`superset.explore.utils.check_datasource_access`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/546d48adbb84b1354d6a3d4ae88dbeba0ad14d44/superset/explore/utils.py#L67-L75)\r\n2. [`superset.databases.decorators.check_datasource_access`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/546d48adbb84b1354d6a3d4ae88dbeba0ad14d44/superset/databases/decorators.py#L33-L69)\r\n\r\nThe later is somewhat of a misnomer, i.e., it checks whether the current user has access to a physical table/view in the underlying database rather than a Superset datasource. \r\n\r\nThis PR remains (2) to be `check_table_access`‚Äîwhich calls `superset.security_manager.can_access_table`‚Äîto more accurately reflect what the decorator does.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

numerous SQL dialects supports  optimizer hints in the form of comments:\r\n\r\n- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/optimizer-hints.html)\r\n- [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-hints.html)\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures when running SQL statements in SQL Lab we don't strip away the comments.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nPreviously we implemented the time comparison in BigNumber viz using some new custom properties in the queryObject to compute the offsets. We are moving away from that approach in order to be more consistent with the way Superset handles time comparison in other visualizations.\r\n\r\nSome of the changes of this PR are:\r\n- Use existing time_offset APIs instead of the instant comparison ones\r\n- Create new shared section to include the controls for time comparison, some taken from Advanced Analytics\r\n- Create a new control label to display the comparison ranges using existing time_range API and not a new one\r\n\r\nThere will be a follow up PR cleaning up the customizations from previous approach, that clean up is left out of this PR to ease the review process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere can be certain items that cannot be accepted in all options. (For instance, metrics cannot be accepted in the columns selection. In cases where the controls solely consist of the columns selection, none of the metrics will be accepted in the overall dropzone, as shown in the screenshot below.)\r\n\r\nTo address this, the commit takes a step forward by checking the eligibility of each filter and hiding the item when there are no eligible options available.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED
