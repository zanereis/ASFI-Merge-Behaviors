API Row Level Security: get rls by username or roles via API #25351\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI have created the following SIP to give the client-side possibility to generate an embedding request by retrieving the row level securities defined on the UI page:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/95374244/0e32b772-5804-4207-8f2a-59bcd05c1030)\r\n\r\nProviding either the username of the user or the role already defined on Apache Superset, API returns the list of RLS to be provided to body of endpoint /api/v1/security/guest_token/:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/95374244/ef896753-2f12-4497-9c07-27b08bfe9ecb)\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the client making the request must know in advance the settings provided at the user interface level. The following endpoints generate output considering the filter type (Basic / Regular) and the presence or absence of the Group Key. Right now a user without providing an rls but only the default value [ ], can display all the data within the dashboard, in my case I needed to manage the display of the type of data with respect to the user requesting the embedding. The output of request will be list of dictionaries with \"clause\" and \"dataset\" as keys, e.g:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n[{\"clause\":\"(province = 'AG')\",\"dataset\":25},{\"clause\":\"(gender = 'boy')\",\"dataset\":2}]\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf the different rls filters associated with the requested user or role have the same group key, the filters associated with the same dataset will be merged using the OR condition, e.g:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n[{\"clause\":\"(province = 'AG') OR (province = 'SI')\",\"dataset\":25}]\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nProposed Change\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/95374244/78f80485-77a1-401a-9bbe-b35da9625500)\r\n\r\nI created new two endpoints:\r\n\r\n- /api/v1/security/get_rls_by_username/\r\n- /api/v1/security/get_rls_by_role/\r\n\r\nthat retrieve users, roles, tables and rls from Metadata tables (using the SQLAlchemy package), convert all filters of type Base to Regular and aggregate the filters with respect to the defined group key value. Obviously considering only the row level securities enabled on that specific user or role.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBEFORE: no endpoints to retrieve RLS configs made by Row Level security settings page\r\n\r\nAFTER: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/95374244/c6860cd1-219f-47b5-b36b-a990d4fd0d07)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCreate an user with a specific role and related RLS, check if endpoints return correct output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

So to avoid it I have added eagerload so that we can get all the data with single query.\r\n\r\nAlso for each role we were doing the same call so to avoid that I fetched all the data in main function and then passed it as parameter to set_role function.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nInorder to test the functionality we need to add SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = True in config.py and then run superset init. Before this changes we will able to see too many queries getting logged. After refactoring number of queries have decreased.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nApply the hour offset defined in the Dataset to relative timestamp filters. \r\n\r\nI created a new method inside the `SqlaTable` to return the offset as human readable time delta, so it could be parsed inside the `superset/utils/date_parser.py` module. Lastly, the offset is applied to the time range in the `get_since_until` function.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14370340/bb48a5ab-863d-4d42-9412-4904ae3f0ae0\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14370340/99ed975e-5b61-482f-9657-145436ab79fe\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Add a dataset with an hour offset;\r\n2. Create a table chart with an timestamp field;\r\n3. Filter the records using a relative filter, like \"Last day\".\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

Note that the [`insert_dashboard`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/06c0a5bba9c6c09ed8d0aba4616b33d46be18c77/tests/integration_tests/base_tests.py#L480-L520) method does flush (and commit) to

SUMMARY\r\nGunicorn 21 fixes a few nasty bugs I ran into, namely:\r\n- A deadlock that can choke workers: https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/2917\r\n- An annoying error that can be seen on logs sometimes: `ValueError: count must be a positive integer (got 0)`: https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/pull/2773\r\n\r\nThe latest patch release has been out for a few months now, and seems to work well based on my testing. Also, v 21 adds Support for Python 3.11 which we are mostly supporting now, and want to officially support soon.\r\n\r\nThe full changelog: https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/news.html\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, rendering 20+ filters takes not normal lot of time due to two issues:\r\n1. The issue with the Select filter. After rendering, Select Filter adds the `__cache` key to the dataMask, and changing dataMask triggering a redraw of all filters again. This happens for each Select filter in sequence. This can be resolved by adding `__cache` to the default dataMask.\r\n2. The issue with the `dataMaskSelected` in the hooks is that it is specified as an object, which always triggers a redraw. This can be resolved by setting `dataMaskSelected` to `JSON.stringify`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/4c3b4ff0-bb12-49eb-aa45-7ff1d8add39c\r\n\r\n#### After\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/db05070e-7dad-478f-a392-276a15848f63\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to any dashboard\r\n2. Add 30 select filters\r\n3. Reload dashboard\r\n4. See that filters take a lot of time for before render.\r\n5 (optional). You can add console log to [FilterBarScrollContext](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/nativeFilters/FilterBar/index.tsx#L120C1-L120C1) such as `console.log('rerendered filters bar!')` to see the number of times it logs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSupport auto-scaling the supersetNode and supersetWorker using HPA with CPU/MEM metrics.\r\nWhen enabled in helm values, will create HPA objects and omit the static number of replicas from the deployments.\r\nHPA templates have been derived from the standard templates generated using `helm create`.\r\nThe default is disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nHPA Objects are created after the values are configured and feature enabled:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/36480650/2ef33b2e-1aed-456f-a899-f163349625c4)\r\n\r\nHPA Is reacting to CPU load and increasing replicas:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/36480650/9619c17b-3b85-4cbe-a49e-0bb1b303a53d)\r\nPods

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nApply with custom values.yaml and set the following options :\r\n```\r\nsupersetNode:\r\n  autoscaling:\r\n    enabled: true\r\n    minReplicas: 1\r\n    maxReplicas: 5\r\n    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80\r\n    targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same options can be set for `supersetWorker`\r\nThe helm install/upgrade will then create the HPA objects and starts monitoring the resource usage and scale replicas.\r\n\r\nTo simulate CPU load we added a sidecar which generates load as the HPA averages across all containers in the pods.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nIn Echarts Treemap, the value formatter (number and currency) was unnecessarily applied to labels when labels were numeric.

SUMMARY\r\nImplements [SIP-98](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24948).\r\n\r\nIf a feature flag `PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTS_AND_THUMBNAILS` is on, use Playwright instead of Selenium to take screenshots of dashboards and charts when preparing reports and thumbnails.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe change should be visible when running a report on a dashboard that contains deck.gl charts.\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/f372524f-c307-431a-932d-21b63b91addf)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/d8bce4c2-973b-4e8b-a882-744680f6f0ee)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTS_AND_THUMBNAILS` ff\r\n2. Setup reports (https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/alerts-reports/)\r\n3. Create a report and verify that the screenshot was taken correctly. If possible, also verify using deck.gl charts\r\n4. Generate thumbnails (https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/cache/#caching-thumbnails)\r\n5. Verify that thumbnails screenshots were taken correctly (including deck.gl charts)\r\n6. If the feature flag is disabled, the screenshots should be taken using Selenium - no changes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR removes custom scripts to cancel running GitHub Actions workflows and replaces them with the built-in functionality [concurrency groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency#overview).\r\n\r\nThis will cancel all running workflow jobs for PRs only. In case it is not a PR, this won't cancel running jobs as `run_id` is unique.\r\n```\r\nconcurrency:\r\n  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.run_id }}\r\n  cancel-in-progress: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nPartially reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/12090\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn case we want to cancel running jobs for commits to master or release tags also, it can be modified to:\r\n```\r\nconcurrency:\r\n  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}\r\n  cancel-in-progress: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nYou can see the cancelled workflows for the first

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe goal of this PR is to make the alerts & reports scheduler job more reliable.  See https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25058 for a great description of one current reliability issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes two main changes to improve reliability\r\n### Adjusts the center of the window used to check cron schedules.\r\nCurrently, the following logic defines the window:\r\n```python\r\nstart_at = time_now - timedelta(seconds=1)\r\nstop_at = time_now + timedelta(seconds=window_size) # window_size = 59\r\n```\r\nThe consequence is that if more than a second had elapsed since the `scheduler` job was originally triggered, any alerts & reports supposed to be triggeredwould not be.  This PR moves the center of the window 30 seconds towards the past, giving more leeway for delayed jobs\r\n### Reads current time based on when celery beat triggered the scheduler job, rather than having the scheduler job generate the current time.\r\nAs I was making the above change, I realized that if the celery queue was backed up, or there was any kind of delay between when celery beat placed the job into the queue and when it was executed, alerts & reports could be missed.  It would be preferable if we could simply use the time at which celery beat triggered the job.  I found that this was not currently [supported natively by celery](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/6974), but there is a [workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40000663/get-celery-beat-trigger-time-on-task) using the `expires` option.  As [noted on the celery repo](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/6974#issuecomment-977939822), this is not a perfect solution, but I see it as much more reliable than the current approach.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a report is supposed to be sent at 12:00, but the celery queue is backed up such that the scheduler job triggered by beat isn't executed until 12:02, this change will make it so that now the report will be triggered, whereas currently it would not be.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25058\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe(https://github.com/clickHouse/clickHouse) are using Superset for internal analytics and found Partition charts to be very useful. But bugs such as https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/10586 make this powerful feature almost unusable.\r\n\r\n- Debugging showed that order of nodes with depth more than 2 is not ordered within parent node.\r\n- Issue is related to partition limit feature that removes nodes from a tree if number of nodes under the single parent is higher than the limit. It dropped data without leaving sum of values dropped and thus icicle node scale was inconsistent.\r\n- Feature partition threshold never worked as 0-1 float parameter was parsed as integer 0 all the time.\r\n- Some recent changes removed time column picker that did not allow to use types other than `Not a time series`\r\n- Incorrect logic to compute place of deeper nodes did not start to draw child nodes within parent height\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n- Feature `Partition threshold` was fixed to get correct setting value\r\n- Added time column picker back\r\n- A separate node with `<other>` name is created to replace all removed nodes within the same parent. This node has cumulative value of all removed nodes. It allows to see significance of pruned partitions and have correct scale for all depth levels. Partition threshold still allows to improve drawing speed significantly for results with many nodes. Ordering of drawn nodes adds `<other>` node after all remaining nodes within same parent\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n1. Partition Limit feature\r\n\r\nBEFORE: Partition Limit=2.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the cache key is only dependent on on the id‚Äôs of the RLS filters applied for the current user/table.  This means that if an existing RLS filter‚Äôs clause is updated, a user with that RLS will still be able to retrieve results that were cached before the RLS was updated since their RLS filter id‚Äôs are unchanged, so the cache key doesn‚Äôt change.  Therefore the user sees results based on the old RLS clause, ignoring the new clause.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes this behavior so that cache keys are instead dependent on the actual clauses of the RLS filters so that RLS rules apply correctly after an RLS clause is updated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen a chart is added to a dashboard with a time range filter applied, adding an additional filter to the chart in Explore results in an issue where the added filter cannot be removed as expected.\r\n\r\nRepro Steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a chart and add it to a dashboard. For example, a pie chart with video_game_sales, where the dimension is \"genre\" and the metric is \"sum(global_sales).\"\r\n1. On the dashboard, apply a native filter for a time range, such as 1998-2023.\r\n2. Click on the chart title to access it in Explore.\r\n3. In Explore, add a new filter to the chart. In this case, add the filter \"publisher in Nintendo\"\r\n4. Overwrite the chart and return to the dashboard.\r\n5. Access the pie chart in Explore once more and attempt to remove the state filter. Overwrite the chart.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe state filter should be removable from the chart after the second overwrite in step 5.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnfortunately, the state filter still persists, and it cannot be removed as expected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![filter](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5705598/4c7ebe00-28ce-44da-bc42-c78d245d4fff)\r\nAfter: \r\n![filter_a](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5705598/939befa4-c680-4c1f-8f8b-a1f7e4990526)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe `database.get_indexes` method, which in turn calls `inspector.get_indexes`, gets called twice on the `get_extra_table_metadata` call, which causes unnecessary query overhead. This PR adds an optional `indexes` argument to the `latest_partition` method to reuse the retrieved indexes when they're available.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

a feature in Superset that permanently adds a second time column to requests to Clickhouse, ElasticSearch, Kusto. But there is an problem with it, as many people think it's a bug :).\r\n\r\nHow about adding a checkbox for feature time secondary column to the dataset? i think it would be better than hardcoding it for all database connections (Clickhouse, elasticsearch, Kusto). It would also allow the ability to add a second time column to other databases.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThere's currently a bug in Superset where (1) if a chart is saved with a `granularity_sqla`, and (2) the `GENERIC_CHART_AXIS` feature is enabled after the chart creation, then the chart will break. This happens for some charts. Stripping `granularity_sqla` is not an option, because some charts still need it even when `GENERIC_CHART_AXIS` is enabled.\r\n\r\n@Vitor-Avila found a workaround where saving the chart again will fix it. So in this PR I'm adding a new column to charts called `force_save`. When the column is true, the chart will save itself when loaded (in explore or a dashboard), and the column will be set to false. This way, charts can be forced to save by setting this column to true, which could be done conditionally (for certain viz types, eg).\r\n\r\nNote that while this is a hack, it's a pattern we've used before. For alerts and reports we had to introduce logic to re-save the chart in order to set `query_context`. See https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15824, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15865, and https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15846.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nHi team,\r\n\r\nWe're looking to make a few changes that would allow folks to populate the `sql_query_mutator` with more useful params. Ultimately we're hoping to get chart_id and dataset_id into query comments, to automate our data masking with Satori. Open to discussion on the best practices to do so.\r\n\r\n**These are the three items we're looking to change:**\r\n- Change [mutate_query_from_config](https://github.com/hwmarkcheng/superset/pull/1/files#diff-af5e15a55ff9c81f441eb6b9b10dae13b2ee17fec614d3e3ad0057ed0dc814aeR819) to take in kwargs (Consistent with intended purpose of sql_query_mutator, see this [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19083))\r\n- Add `slice_id` to `query_obj `:  As addition context for `query_obj`. Having slice_id is versatile and can open doors for powerful integrations/automations. We originally wanted to add in the whole slice object for more options, but some integration tests failed since the object cannot be converted to a dictionary. Happy to discuss the best way to do this going forward.\r\n- Add `chart_id` and `dataset_id` as default parameters for [mutate_query_from_config](https://github.com/hwmarkcheng/superset/pull/1/files)\r\n\r\n**Example Usecase, Automated Data Access Requests via Satori:**\r\nContext: We use Satori for our data access management.\r\n- Users posts chart link to request access to specific schemas -> DAR team approves request -> We grab chart/dataset id from query -> Integrate with Satori to automatically identify all schemas in the chart and grant the user access to them\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n- Change [sql_query_mutator](https://github.com/hwmarkcheng/superset/pull/1/files#diff-c99ae4b2b09b756ab2189a99a9685229f9d12633fc2616c368ea869770f603bfR1212) to add kwargs as comments. **Note this will be reverted before committing (we don't want to change this)**\r\n  - Click view query on any chart in a dashboard. You should now see the chart_id, as well as the dataset_id\r\n  - <img width=\"1403\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 4 34 57 PM\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe `SQLParse.is_select` method checks only the first statement of a query. **Currently this is not an issue because it only gets called on a per-statement basis** in `superset/sql_lab.py.py` (via the DB engine spec `is_select_query` method), but it could potentially cause security issues in the future if the method is called on a query with multiple statements:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from superset.sql_parse import ParsedQuery\r\n>>> ParsedQuery(\"SELECT 1; DROP DATABASE superset\").is_select()\r\nTrue\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the method so it checks for every statement.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR practically drops the apt package `build-essential` (`gcc` etc.) from the Docker image, by removing it in the same step it got installed. This package is needed solely to install `python-ldap` and `mysqlclient` (from `requirements/development.txt`).\r\n\r\n**Important**: Users building on top of `apache/superset` would have to install these tools themselves potentially breaking their Dockerfile depending on their usage.\r\n\r\n----\r\n~~Also removed because not needed:~~\r\n- ~~`rm /var/[log,tmp]/*`: Both dirs are empty.~~\r\n- ~~`rm /tmp/*`: Basically empty except for a single file from upstream Python Docker image. Removing this file wouldn't save image size.~~\r\n- ~~`apt-get clean`: [runs automatically](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#run) for debian-based docker images.~~\r\n\r\n(already merged) \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThis results in a smaller image:\r\n- uncompressed: `1.29 GB` down to `1.04 GB`\r\n- compressed: `382 MB` down to `311 MB`\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n-  check if the image builds: ```docker build . -t test```\r\n-  run `docker-compose.yml` based on that image and check if all services are running\r\n- successfully run integration tests on that docker stack\r\n- successfully run unit test\r\n- check GitHub CI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an incorrect default value for config variable `UPLOAD_FOLDER`:\r\n- current `superset/app/static/uploads/`\r\n- new `superset/static/uploads/`\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n- `static/uploads/` is now checked into git (analog to `superset/static/assets/`)\r\n- `static/assets/` was initially checked into git years before, but in another commit (also years before) then .gitignored without removal from git (I think unintentionally)\r\n\r\nThe config variables `IMG_UPLOAD_FOLDER` and `IMG_UPLOAD_URL` were never used (found nothing using full text search) and are therefore removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. `docker build . -t test`\r\n2. run integrations (+unit) tests based on that docker image\r\n3. look for correct directories\r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis migration is marked as causing potential downtime, which we did see using a postgres db where it was locking the table while dropping the constraint and deadlocking with production db requests. I‚Äôm using two different techniques here to attempt to make this a more performant/non blocking migration so that we can run it without any downtime.  \r\n1) instead of dropping the old constraint and creating a new one, I am renaming the old constraint which is a non-blocking action. Then creating the new constraint with the cascade on delete. \r\n2) utilizing postgres‚Äô feature to not validate constraint updates. I‚Äôm using this on the subsequent drop constraint as again it is a way to drop the column in a non-blocking way. Then we validate the changes which also don‚Äôt block. \r\n\r\nI have run the benchmark scripts several times up to over 1m rows which is much more than the size of the table that we had issues with. Other than the tests locally, this hasn‚Äôt been validated in production yet. \r\n\r\nThe other callout is that with renaming and then creating a new constraint, there is a period of time when there will be two constraints before the original one is dropped. From what I can tell it should work fine under these conditions but it has only been tested locally. \r\n\r\n\r\nThese changes only affect migrations running on Postgres metadata databases. \r\n\r\nfor the embedded table:\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nCurrent: 0.40 s\r\n10+: 0.44 s\r\n100+: 0.44 s\r\n1000+: 0.26 s\r\n10000+: 0.26 s\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the dashboard slices table:\r\nCurrent: 0.30 s\r\n10+: 0.45 s\r\n100+: 0.45 s\r\n1000+: 0.28 s\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
