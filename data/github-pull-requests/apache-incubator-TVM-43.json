`evaluate_model_accuracy` addresses only a very specific use case - when one only cares about the average accuracy and runtime of a host-driven AOT model. This prevents users from implementing workarounds to bugs like #12538, and means we redundantly return both model predictions and the accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `evaluate_model_accuracy` in `python/tvm/micro/testing/evaluation.py` into `predict_labels_aot`. This function has the type signature:\r\n```python\r\ndef predict_labels_aot(session, aot_executor, input_data, runs_per_sample=1):\r\n```\r\nUnlike `evaluate_model_accuracy`, `predict_labels_aot` does not take as input the true labels of the data. Instead, it returns an iterator of `(prediction, runtime)` tuples, and lets users do what they want with these.\n\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

current support of mixed precision in adreno schedules  was implemented as standalone schedules having \"fp32\" suffix. Such kernels can be selected during compilation due to two reasons\r\n\r\n1. We had higher priority for fp16_acc32 schedule than pure fp16 schedules\r\n2. If we saw AutoTVM tune statistics with proper schedule name\r\n\r\nThe tune flow in its turn was not able to distinguish and point only fp16 or fp16_acc32. Both schedules are tuned and during the compilation the schedule having best time is selected. I.e. by fact without artificial approach we are not able to tune and compile pure fp16 or fp16_acc32. Only manual selection of tune statistics causes currently to execute one of this mode.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the conversion function to fp16 was custom made in the user's script that isnot available to the public tvm user.\r\n\r\nTo address above issues we are proposing to use `ToMixedPrecision()` pass. It supports mixed precision (fp16 compute with fp32 accumulation) as well.\r\n\r\nCurrent PR changes\r\n1. Adreno strategy to remove extra fp16_acc32 schedules\r\n2. topi/adreno/* to leave the only schedule per each convolution instead of 3\r\n3. topi/adreno/conv2d_alter_op.py <- to address performance issue happening in the new flow due to different order of casts and causing in some cases more data be passed between opencl kernels. We addressed case where we have number of input channel not divideable by 4 and number of output channels dividable by 4. Previously we generated 4 kernels for repacking data in runtime, now we have only two kernels for such case and we do not repack weights in runtime + we do not repack output back to

Enable spike based AoTTestRunner for AoT/CRT related test cases\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nI have a followup ready based on this PR, which enable usage of spike for MicroTVM deployment (ProjectAPI Server).\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- Why not use existing CSI-NN GCC toolchain?\r\n\r\nThat toolchain (`Xuantie-900-gcc-linux`) is mainly targeting 64-bit devices capable of running Linux. While it could be used for 32-bit bare metal targets as well (using the `-static` compile flag), it is missing relevant multilib arches, such as `rv32gc+ilp32d` to be  usable. Thus, I use Sifives GCC (which does currenlty not support the RVV1.0 extension)\r\n\r\n- Should we fix the version of spike being build or just use the latest development branch?\r\n\n\ncc @Mousius

went a long way to improving microTVM code reuse, but introduced an unintentional? change. Previously, the full `pytest` names of microTVM tests included the value of `board`, prepended to any paremeterization. For example, `test_rpc_large_array` would have the name:\r\n```\r\ntests.micro.zephyr.test_zephyr.test_rpc_large_array[nucleo_f746zg-(4*1024)]\r\n```\r\nThis behavior was useful, as it meant that exported Junit XML files would correctly record which board the test was run on. However, after #12207 the names of tests stopped including this information:\r\n```\r\ntests.micro.zephyr.test_zephyr.test_rpc_large_array[(4*1024)]\r\n```\r\nThis prevented Junit from differentiating between the tests when they were run on different boards, and instead just overwrote results on previous boards. Additionally, we never made this distinction for `common` tests that were parameterized by `platform`, so tests like `tests.micro.common.test_autotune.test_kws_autotune_workflow` would have one of the platforms overwrite the other (with whichever one finished last being the one that was ultimately reported).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the `pytest_generate_tests` hook to fix this issue. Now, the `board` parameter is included in the test name as before, and the `platform` parameter will be included for any tests that use that fixture (e.g. common tests).\n\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

this change wants to add some minor updation to region estimator used by buffer compaction:\r\n- Add and clearify among `EstimateRegionStrictBound`, `EstimateRegionLowerBound` and `EstimateRegionUpperBound`\r\n   \r\n  Originally we have `EstimateRegionLowerBound`, actually it implements strict bound estimation IMO. Now add `upper` and `strict` version for where we actually want them.\r\n\r\n- When estimating upperbounds (eg. in buffer compaction), try estimate each dimension independently when they are dependent accesses where `EstimateRegionLowerBound` is expected to fail. \r\n\r\n  Eg, `A[i, i], 3 < i < 16`  fails via `EstimateRegionLowerBound` who check indices be independent. But we can still try best to invoke strict bound analysis on each dimension individually.\r\n\r\n- If range->extent == 1 for `EvalSet(range, dom)`, invoke `EvalSet(range->min, dom)` instead.\r\n  \r\n  Eg, `EvalSet([k*k, k*k+1), dom_k)` results to [-inf, +inf] due to current algorithm limitation but  `EvalSet(k*k, dom_k)` results to a range which makes more sense.\r\n    \r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao

adds a `--tasks` flag to the `tvmc tune` command to filter the lists of tasks to be tuned. See examples below.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n- As auto-tuning can be quite time consuming, it is often desirable to cut down the number of tuned tasks in a session.\r\n- If the tuning session was canceled halfway through, it would be a bad idea to start from scratch. Instead continue with the last untuned task\r\n- Some tasks have more impact on the model performance than others, thus we should be able to train some tasks longer than others\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n1. Use `--task list` to show which tasks are available for tuning\r\n```\r\n$ tvmc tune toycar.tflite -o out.txt --task list\r\nAvailable Tasks for tuning:\r\n  0. Task(func_name=dense_nopack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 640), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (128, 640), 'int...\r\n  1. Task(func_name=dense_pack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 640), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (128, 640), 'int16...\r\n  2. Task(func_name=dense_nopack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 128), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (128, 128), 'int...\r\n  3. Task(func_name=dense_pack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 128), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (128, 128), 'int16...\r\n  4. Task(func_name=dense_nopack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 128), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (8, 128), 'int16...\r\n  5. Task(func_name=dense_pack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 128), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (8, 128), 'int16')...\r\n  6. Task(func_name=dense_nopack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 8), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (128, 8), 'int16')...\r\n  7. Task(func_name=dense_pack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 8), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (128, 8), 'int16'), ...\r\n  8. Task(func_name=dense_nopack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 128), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (640, 128), 'int...\r\n  9. Task(func_name=dense_pack.x86, args=(('TENSOR', (1, 128), 'int16'), ('TENSOR', (640, 128), 'int16...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Filter the list of tasks to be tuned:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Only tune a single task (index 5)\r\ntvmc tune toycar.tflite -o out.txt --tasks 5\r\n\r\n# Tunes tasks starting with index 6\r\ntvmc tune toycar.tflite -o out.txt --tasks \"6-\"\r\n\r\n# Tune tasks 1,4,5,6,8,9\r\ntvmc tune toycar.tflite -o out.txt --tasks \"1,4-6,8-\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nI added a basic unit test for the `filter_tasks` utility in `tests/python/driver/tvmc/test_autotuner.py`.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n- ~~While the (truncated) string representations of AutoTVM tasks are quite helpful to pick the correct tasks, using AutoScheduler the tasks can not really be distinguished from each other (only by index). Is there a way to get similar information from AutoScheduler tasks?~~\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius

that we only need to tile to `1`\r\n2. if `out = in_channel // groups // ic_bn` ！= 0, but  the `out * ic_bn * group < in_channel` .

change adds a callback for visualizing the FLOPS during tuning (AutoTVM & AutoScheduler (**NEW**)) over time using Matplotlib.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### With Python\r\n\r\nCreate callback (`multi=False`: 1 window per Task, `multi=True`: all tasks in a single window):\r\n\r\n```\r\nvisualize_callback = autotvm.callback.visualize_progress(task_idx, live=True, out_path=\"plot.png\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nPass callback to tuner:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntuner.tune(\r\n  n_trial=100,\r\n  measure_option=measure_option,\r\n  callbacks=[visualize_callback],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### With TVM command line\r\n\r\n~~Just add a `--visualize` to the `tvmc tune` command.~~\r\n\r\nThere are three modes available:\r\n\r\n- *Live only:* add `--visualize live` to `tvmc tune` command\r\n- *File only:* add `--visualize /pah/to/file.png` to `tvmc tune` command\r\n- *Both:* add `--visualize live,/path/to/file.png` to `tvmc tune` command\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![tvmc_tune_visualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7712605/185800229-2b84a914-b5df-4afd-86e6-a57747cb81d4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional changes\r\n\r\n- Make `si_prefix` in `tvmc/autotuner.py` variable (Prerequisite for a later PR)\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n- ~~How to handle the `matplotlib` python dependency? Should I change `python/gen_requirements.py` and if yes which groups (tvmc/dev/?)?~~\r\n- ~~The graph window automatically closes when the tuning is finished. Do we need an option to keep it open until closed?~~ Solved by newly introduced `keep_open` option\r\n- ~~A similar feature for the AutoScheduler would be nice, too. I can look into it if there is interest.~~\r\n- ~~Saving the plot to a file would also be possible. We only need to decide how to expose this to the cmdline (i.e. `--visualize plot.png`)~~\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius

AutoTVM's `ApplyHistoryBest` class does not support loading tuning logs from memory. This is a pet peeve of mine, as it requires you to work with a `tempfile` whenever writing autotuning tests. This is also just strange, as the rest of AutoTVM has support for text buffers (e.g. `tvm.autotvm.callback.log_to_file` supports passing in a text buffer, letting us write to but not read from them).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `ApplyHistoryBest` handles input arguments very unintuitively. Before this PR, it allowed users to pass string filepaths, a list of string filepaths, or an `Iterable` (such as a list) of input and result tuples. However, it did not support taking in `StringIO` objects as mentioned above, nor `pathlib.Path` objects, nor combinations of a filepath and an `Iterable` of tuples.\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, we would change `ApplyHistoryBest` to take as input a path-like object, file-like object, or an `Iterable` of input and result tuples (similar to what `ApplyGraphBest` takes as an argument). However, this would break the existing functionality to take as input a list of filepaths.\r\n\r\nTo be backwards compatible, while fixing this issue, this pull request defines a new type inside `dispatcher.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nRecords = Union[\r\n    Union[str, bytes, Path],  # Path-like objects\r\n    TextIOBase,  # File-like objects\r\n    Iterable[Tuple[MeasureInput, MeasureResult]],\r\n]\r\n```\r\nIt then rewrites `ApplyHistoryBest.load` so it takes the following arguments:\r\n```python\r\ndef load(self, records: Union[Records, Iterable[Records]]):\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds unit tests for this new functionality, and fixes a relevant bug in `tests/micro/common/test_autotune.py` in which a `StringIO` object was passed to `apply_history_best`, causing it to appear to pass but not actually read any data.","created_at":"2022-08-21T13:46:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T16:32:57Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T16:32:57Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T16:32:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"da5836f230525afe8984dcbfea8ee788a6286b5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/131e56ab5ba4a5f4c73077693543aae707601f41","head":{"label":"guberti:add-load-history-best-typing","ref":"add-load-history-best-typing","sha":"131e56ab5ba4a5f4c73077693543aae707601f41","user":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371518634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE1MTg2MzQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"guberti/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guberti/tvm","description":"Open

in tir, using `cache_read` will rewrite all consumer blocks of the specified buffer in the current scope. However, there may be cases where we want to apply that transformation only to a subset of consumer blocks. In the te version of cache_read, this is explicitly specified through a list of `consumer_blocks`. This PR extends the tir version of `cache_read` with an optional `consumer_blocks` argument.

`FInferCorrectLayout` was set to `ElemwiseArbitraryLayout` which is for layout agnostic operators.

So i write a `L2NormalizeInferCorrectLayout` for it.\r\nAlso, add some tests.\r\n\r\nBTW! I'm still new to cpp, please advise if there is anything inappropriate in code.

several decorators and classes for declaring tensor intrinsics is a (hopefully) more ergonomic way. The `AcceleratorInterface` and `IntrinsicDeclaration` classes act as handles to accelerators and intrinsics declared underneath them as well as places to store metadata in the future.\r\n\r\n`@intrinsic` and `@AcceleratorInterface.intrinsic`decorators are for declaring new intrinsics.\r\n\r\n`@generator` and `@run_generator` add utilities for generator functions (functions which return an intrinsic).\r\n\r\nSome example snippets are in the docstrings but it would probably be helpful to make an example test though I am not entirely sure what would be the best to put there. Anyway, thoughts are welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the TIR tag is the most sensible so please correct me as needed.\r\n\r\nTagging: @csullivan, @JosephTheOctonaut, @Lunderberg \r\n\r\n\r\ncc

constants, represented by `AllocateConst` nodes, were introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8509. They are generated if `link-params = 1`. \r\n\r\nAt Relay level, `link_params = True` makes constant tensors kept bound to the function body, rather than lifting them to function parameters during `FuseOps`. So we end up with the following Relay prim func, for example:\r\n```\r\nfn (%p0: Tensor[(128, 768), uint8]) -> Tensor[(128, 768), int32] {\r\n  nn.contrib_dense_pack(%p0, meta[relay.Constant][0], units=None, out_dtype=\"int32\", weight_layout=\"NC32n4c\")\r\n} \r\n```\r\n(if `link-params = False`, which is the default, the weight also becomes the parameter of the function).\r\n\r\nI found that TensorIR related components below do not support such TIR-level constants currently:\r\n* `CreatePrimFunc`: It assumes that all tensors will be passed as parameters. This doesn't hold if `link-params = 1`.\r\n* `PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation`: Handling for `AllocateConst` nodes is incorrect. It creates a duplicated allocation for constant already allocated by `AllocateConst` node, which `StorageRewrite` complains because there are two allocations of the same-name constant.\r\n* `LeafBlockRemovalPlan` (used by `compute_at` and `compute_inline`): Assumes that the body of `Block` begins with `SeqStmt`. This may not be the case since I placed `AllocateConst` at the beginning of a body, like below\r\n```\r\ndef main(...) -> None:\r\n    ...\r\n    fused_nn_contrib_conv2d_NCHWc_constant_1 = T.allocate_const(..., \"int32\", [1, 16, 1, 1, 4])\r\n    fused_constant_0 = T.allocate_const(..., \"int8\", [16, 16, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4])\r\n    for i0, i1, i2, i3, i4 in T.grid(1, 16, 58, 58, 4):\r\n       ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most important change is the introduction of `CreatePrimFuncWithConstants` function. It reuses `tir::BindParams` pass added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8509 to create a PrimFunc with `AllocateConst` nodes. Since this new function takes an array of `runtime::NDArray` as an additional argument, I had to change all places where `CreatePrimFunc` is used.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao1994 @Hzfengsy @vinx13 @csullivan

our microTVM implementation of `depthwise_conv2d` uses the fallback schedule, and performance is subsequently terrible. This change adds a schedule for certain cases of `depthwise_conv2d` when it is run on a Cortex M4 or M7 based chip (though I mainly thought about the M4). Almost all of the \"big\" performance speedups have been implemented, which should make our implementation faster than TFLite Micro and comparable to CMSIS-NN:\r\n- Performs 4x fewer memory loads than the fallback implementation by loading four `int8` values from the kernel and input tensor at a time. This is the main source of our speedup.\r\n- Uses a hand-written assembly micro-kernel utilizing the `__SMLAD` instruction to compute convolutions for four channels at once.\r\n- Uses a specialized kernel packing to remove four assembly instructions from the micro kernel. \r\n- When `stride>1`, pads the kernel asymmetrically to slightly reduce the size of the padded tensor.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the interest of merging a PR I did not implement a few other optimizations. The most important one is that this schedule is not autotunable in any meaningful way (besides reordering a few loops). In an ideal world, we would use custom knobs to allow reordering of the instructions inside `QUAD_CHANNEL_TENSOR_REARRANGE_SUM_DSP` (e.g. do we load the kernel from memory first, or perform halfword packs on our input tensor first?). This would improve performance on the M4 by a little bit, but I suspect would improve M7 performance a lot.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would have liked to handle the edges of the convolution with strip mining, instead of by padding the input tensor. This padding requires copying the entire tensor, and is therefor slow, but support for strip mining in TVM is pretty bad. A few other desired improvements:\r\n- Custom knobs for reordering instructions in micro kernel\r\n- Replace tensor padding with strip mining or something else\r\n- Use a specialized version of `QUAD_CHANNEL_TENSOR_REARRANGE_SUM_DSP` for the entry in kernels with an odd number of entries (e.g. 3x3 kernels)\r\n- Generalize the micro kernel to support kernel sizes beyond 3x3\r\n- Similar to the above, remove other restrictions on the use of this micro kernel (e.g. support kernel dilation)\r\n- Allow requantization and ReLU instructions to be fused in a way that's not slow\r\n\r\nI'm marking this PR as a draft for now, since there currently aren't any tests. Thanks to Andrew for his help with explaining how TVM does
