change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T00:57:14Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T01:21:58Z","closed_at":"2018-09-05T01:21:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMinor code refactoring, no functional change. All of them are reported by IntelliJ IDEA.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* remove unnecessary null check\r\n* fix typo\r\n* code simplification\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt should have no functional change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

method\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-01T03:23:07Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T06:14:51Z","closed_at":"2018-11-08T06:14:51Z","merged_at":"2018-11-08T06:14:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"117d48530672440bdb63ab68033f71a9535e1473","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3cfb36eb02334d0187d2b14fcda277726afc95fe","head":{"label":"kexianjun:master","ref":"master","sha":"3cfb36eb02334d0187d2b14fcda277726afc95fe","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

verify during the next release.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-31T10:01:45Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T01:42:02Z","closed_at":"2018-09-05T01:09:44Z","merged_at":"2018-09-05T01:09:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7e7c143462e7371096b9c681e1ee7ce52e979e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/19","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/19","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/19/labels","id":3482638,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzQ4MjYzOA==","number":19,"title":"2.6.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":31,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-09T11:50:57Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T06:32:27Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-01-15T09:48:19Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2417/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2417/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2417/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d325cfeb16bb3c11ca69d1008c6ffba839e16cf6","head":{"label":"chickenlj:apache-release-script","ref":"apache-release-script","sha":"d325cfeb16bb3c11ca69d1008c6ffba839e16cf6","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Brief changelog\r\n\r\nTurn on private access(netty4) modifier, inherit client and server\r\nConsumer adds protocolConfig\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-31T05:42:36Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T12:24:56Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T12:24:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"902c40dce3e7f2866f963bfa55a4205160293c76","assignee":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"qinliujie","id":8599441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8599441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie","html_url":"https://github.com/qinliujie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T10:47:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T09:28:44Z","closed_at":"2018-09-19T09:28:44Z","merged_at":"2018-09-19T09:28:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"cd60e58e1a579749c89c6ac8ddb39f8e8e894ef5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/71baab571ae6a71df92f0656000fff60b87e740c","head":{"label":"lllichen:issues_2348_abstract_registry_util_test_enhancement","ref":"issues_2348_abstract_registry_util_test_enhancement","sha":"71baab571ae6a71df92f0656000fff60b87e740c","user":{"login":"lllichen","id":11263332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYzMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11263332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen","html_url":"https://github.com/lllichen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9135546c847edb3eb6d8abd3efd46f9ab702bd2e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T10:39:04Z","updated_at":"2018-09-02T09:46:54Z","closed_at":"2018-08-30T10:40:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ea610fbe40dc39429a7b06e5354ffb0c20df0d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/465ae866c5225e23000577c1e717746296c489f0","head":{"label":"lllichen:issues_2348_abstract_registry_util_test_enhancement","ref":"issues_2348_abstract_registry_util_test_enhancement","sha":"465ae866c5225e23000577c1e717746296c489f0","user":{"login":"lllichen","id":11263332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYzMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11263332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen","html_url":"https://github.com/lllichen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ff373a7db7645ea1b55bf84150d0326d1e999b78","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2006](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2006)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n当有异常发生在 `ExchangeCode` 的 `encodeResponse` 方法的时候，会发送一个`exception response`给 consume，但是初始的 response 也会在`exception response` 被发送完成之后给发送出去，就会出现发送两次的情况，导致服务出现异常\r\nWhen an exception occurs in the encodeResponse method of `ExchangeCode`, an `exception response` is sent to consume, but the initial response is also sent out after the `exception response` is sent out, which causes an exception to the service.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T08:40:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T09:31:23Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T09:31:23Z","merged_at":"2018-08-28T09:31:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"86d734722d7309fca22499a7b7ccd2a42570d3e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2396/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2396/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2396/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/95bf819f4913fe62c699d84129dace4d1a61f6bc","head":{"label":"gongchangwangpi:master","ref":"master","sha":"95bf819f4913fe62c699d84129dace4d1a61f6bc","user":{"login":"gongchangwangpi","id":13031640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDMxNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13031640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi","html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangwangpi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146415553,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY0MTU1NTM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"gongchangwangpi/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gongchangwangpi","id":13031640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDMxNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13031640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi","html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangwangpi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangwangpi/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`.

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSolve the [issue#1814](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/1814). \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nNow we can simply add `<dubbo:registry wait=\"6000\" address=\"multicast://224.5.6.7:1234\"/>` in xml to set gracefully showdown param.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T03:51:57Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T12:13:58Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T12:13:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10a87398d02ce283933608869317e29b1bb69f7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/717da2ff8930a528e16689b730fae83f86c3b7ac","head":{"label":"shilei1719:master","ref":"master","sha":"717da2ff8930a528e16689b730fae83f86c3b7ac","user":{"login":"shilei1719","id":21306506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA2NTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21306506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719","html_url":"https://github.com/shilei1719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146286779,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYyODY3Nzk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"shilei1719/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shilei1719","id":21306506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA2NTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21306506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719","html_url":"https://github.com/shilei1719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shilei1719/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

Support configuring dubbo.service.shutdown.wait / dubbo.service.shutdown.wait.seconds in xml file.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd SpringConfigUtils which invokes ConfigUtils and it's invoked in ServiceBean.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nconfiguration sample:\r\n```\r\n<dubbo:application name=\"demo-provider\">\r\n        <dubbo:parameter key=\"dubbo.service.shutdown.wait\" value=\"15000\"/>\r\n</dubbo:application>\r\n```\r\nIt's loaded into `ApplicationConfig.parameters` and set to `ConfigUtils.properties`, the gracefulShutdown method use the property in `ConfigUtils.properties`.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue#1293. Provide user-define strategy to get `ReferenceConfig` from `ReferenceConfigCache`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd methods in ReferenceConfigCache.KeyGenerator .\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nthree methods that user can implement.\r\n```\r\nString generateKey(String[] keys);\r\nString[] mapReferenceConfigToCustomKeys(ReferenceConfig<?> referenceConfig);\r\nReferenceConfig mapCustomKeysToReferenceConfig(String[] keys);\r\n```\r\nIf user implements these method then the method `ReferenceConfigCache#get(java.lang.String[])` can be used.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

relationship\r\n- add putProxyURL and getProxyURL functions\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix issue #1054\r\nIn `DubboInvoker.doInvoke`, there are some lines to add attachment to the `invocation`.\r\nThe application name from url parameter can be put into the attachments of invocation for sending to provider.\r\n\r\nUser can work with `DubboProtocol.reply` to print logs and so on.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\ndubbo-rpc/dubbo-rpc-dubbo/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/rpc/protocol/dubbo/DubboInvoker.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nut pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-08-28T03:34:43Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T03:10:27Z","closed_at":"2018-08-30T03:10:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd6e87928605804cc2e57af5f076240916de9e39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T03:31:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T03:44:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T03:44:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"177be4a0e0ea1e66084319f39b31e8b9e37e2a9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2376/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2376/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2376/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/988fc5fae9c25b53077e57f69cdd16b55bcadddd","head":{"label":"shilei1719:master","ref":"master","sha":"988fc5fae9c25b53077e57f69cdd16b55bcadddd","user":{"login":"shilei1719","id":21306506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA2NTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21306506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719","html_url":"https://github.com/shilei1719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146286779,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYyODY3Nzk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"shilei1719/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shilei1719","id":21306506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA2NTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21306506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719","html_url":"https://github.com/shilei1719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shilei1719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shilei1719/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

2来完成的。具体代码编写于HeaderExchangeChannelTest类。\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

For get 'graceful-shutdown timeout'  attribute from  xml file.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

HeaderExchangeCHannel.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T03:19:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T03:21:45Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T03:21:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e06a778b6170d30a30be750a5221892fa33260c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/21e3a12d1ba8d55bef8a32563628c62bfc2233f9","head":{"label":"1409070209:master","ref":"master","sha":"21e3a12d1ba8d55bef8a32563628c62bfc2233f9","user":{"login":"1409070209","id":17427480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI3NDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17427480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209","html_url":"https://github.com/1409070209","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146273506,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYyNzM1MDY=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"1409070209/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"1409070209","id":17427480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI3NDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17427480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209","html_url":"https://github.com/1409070209","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1409070209/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/1409070209/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo support the feature: provider will know the appName of consumer.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- To append the consumer's appName in the request for rpc invocation, we get the name through ConfigUtil and store it in the map relation (parameters) of URL && attachment of RpcInvocation.\r\n- For provider, wo offer a method (getConsumerAppName) in WrappedChannelHandler to get the consumer's appName.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\ntristanhuang\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T03:13:48Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T03:12:11Z","closed_at":"2018-08-30T03:12:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05130983f3b8b2e70cf9c9b6cab0ba5b984e64bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6dcb5f4bb78c1ecdb97e89c3eaf2a76e17ca031c","head":{"label":"TristanHuang0501:master","ref":"master","sha":"6dcb5f4bb78c1ecdb97e89c3eaf2a76e17ca031c","user":{"login":"TristanHuang0501","id":23564846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY0ODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23564846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501","html_url":"https://github.com/TristanHuang0501","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146275825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYyNzU4MjU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"TristanHuang0501/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TristanHuang0501","id":23564846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY0ODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23564846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501","html_url":"https://github.com/TristanHuang0501","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TristanHuang0501/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TristanHuang0501/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

purpose of issue3 is to solve the problem that multiple Dubbo applications deployed by docker on a single machine, which use the same IP from a cluster perspective. At the same way, multiple Dubbo applications within a single LAN use the same IP from a wide area network perspective.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is that the application independently specifies the address to register in the registry, which can be either an IP address, a domain name or a host name. The solution mentioned in is to use the environment variable to specify the registered address.\r\n\r\nSo in the registration phase, we take out the value of the environment variable when we configure the registration. Because we find that the registered address supports multiple configurations, we put the new address directly in the registration list.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #2043 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nchange code ` AbstractInterfaceConfig.java` \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nadd the unit test of the HeaderExchangeChannel.class which is located in incubator-dubbo-master\\dubbo-remoting\\dubbo-remoting-api\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\dubbo\\remoting\\exchange\\support\\header\\HeaderExchangeChannel.java\r\n# Brief changelog\r\n### 1.Add HeaderExchangeChannelTest.class\r\nadd the unit tests for the methds as follows:\r\n\r\n- HeaderExchangeChannel getOrAddChannel(Channel ch)\r\n- void removeChannelIfDisconnected(Channel ch)\r\n- void send(Object message\r\n- void send(Object message, boolean sent)\r\n- ResponseFuture request(Object request)\r\n- ResponseFuture request(Object request, int timeout)\r\n- boolean isClosed()\r\n- void close()\r\n- void close(int timeout)\r\n- void startClose()\r\n- InetSocketAddress getLocalAddress()\r\n- InetSocketAddress getRemoteAddress()\r\n- URL getUrl()\r\n- boolean isConnected()\r\n- ChannelHandler getChannelHandler()\r\n- ExchangeHandler getExchangeHandler()\r\n- Object getAttribute(String key)\r\n- void setAttribute(String key, Object value)\r\n- void removeAttribute(String key)\r\n- boolean hasAttribute(String key)\r\n- int hashCode()\r\n### 2.Modify MockChannel.class\r\nadd the method:\r\n ```\r\npublic boolean isClosing(){return  closing;}\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd an internal filter to add consumer application name to Invocation attachements.In the provider endpoint,use RpcContext to get consumer application name.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-08-28T01:46:44Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T10:08:17Z","closed_at":"2018-08-31T10:08:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdc6351f49b779cdd9ad98604bc70d98489e33cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

a  new method of getting ReferenceConfig through url,name,version\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

RpcContext, so the provider can get application of consumer by RpcContext. \r\nTO be specific, we add the property of ConsumerApplication to RpcContext, before invoke, we add the\r\napplication of consumer in the ConsumerContextFilter \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnhance TagRouter: modify tag router strategy\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThanks kirito for making a new big feature at first time.\r\nThe key point is with current implement, an invocation with a tag can't return all invokers in TagRouter.\r\nSo I suggest here:\r\nAdd a forceTag flag(TAG_FORCE_KEY = \"tag.force\"), default value is **TRUE**.\r\n1. When it's true, TagRouter strickly match invokers' tag. \r\n    - An invocation with \"black\" tag only match invokers with \"black\" tag. \r\n    - An invocation with empty tag only match invokers with empty tag.  \r\n    - An invocation match no invokers will return no invokers.  \r\n2. When it's false(default), TagRouter match invokers' tag by the most invokers strategy. \r\n    - An invocation with \"black\" tag match invokers with \"black\" tag. If no invokers with \"black\" tag, return all invokers.\r\n    - An invocation with empty tag will match all invokers.\r\n    - An invocation match no invokers will return all invokers.  \r\nThen we can cover all conditions for using TagRouter.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUT passed.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-24T02:56:52Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:57:05Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:57:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9edba8e710d20dd44b848f61d705cec1d1d89e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6b1c026c38da227ca4584efab75399231ac7f73f","head":{"label":"kimmking:master","ref":"master","sha":"6b1c026c38da227ca4584efab75399231ac7f73f","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":127419937,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjc0MTk5Mzc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kimmking/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSet Dubbo root pom as parent also for BOM module. \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-21T06:58:19Z","updated_at":"2018-10-29T06:34:40Z","closed_at":"2018-10-16T03:41:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50dbd3c866125933d3bfe7af2989d8a38e25dc53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/55e17cd3e7fc8bbc97531861f5bcebb373ec4afc","head":{"label":"ulinkwo:move-dubbo-serialization-fst","ref":"move-dubbo-serialization-fst","sha":"55e17cd3e7fc8bbc97531861f5bcebb373ec4afc","user":{"login":"ulinkwo","id":45244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo","html_url":"https://github.com/ulinkwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136700666,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY3MDA2NjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ulinkwo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulinkwo","id":45244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo","html_url":"https://github.com/ulinkwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulinkwo/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsupplemental change for PR#1973\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- add necessary content in LICENSE\r\n- move utility method from StringUtils to ClassHelper\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-08-21T05:35:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T08:12:18Z","closed_at":"2018-08-22T08:12:14Z","merged_at":"2018-08-22T08:12:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"7500033b9d22e2162c5ab614d3233eb43aaeebd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0e7281b388e1f9d5c236961da2a01113a3056e9f","head":{"label":"beiwei30:pr1973-follow-up","ref":"pr1973-follow-up","sha":"0e7281b388e1f9d5c236961da2a01113a3056e9f","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9c8f4e761951bfac0ad50e3bffe92824e5497a6d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

context\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-16T02:35:11Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T05:03:05Z","closed_at":"2018-08-16T05:03:05Z","merged_at":"2018-08-16T05:03:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a267f86b47f93860754d4b1dc6f95db251c4d0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cd41e410d9d0190eb32a44bb35bae33d5ee077b0","head":{"label":"diecui1202:delete-dubbo-all-javadoc","ref":"delete-dubbo-all-javadoc","sha":"cd41e410d9d0190eb32a44bb35bae33d5ee077b0","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ √] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed issue #1343.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-08-14T03:58:14Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T06:47:03Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T06:43:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f8b758e38aea63ea9261d38ceee09fc6f37a51c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n#1713 \r\nfix bugs for issue 1713\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix Issue #1343\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nFile Changed:\r\nServiceConfig.Java\r\n\r\nMain Change:\r\nWhen listen failed, detect new idle port.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n#1728 \r\n\r\nfix bugs for issue 1728\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Capture the specific conflict type and continue to automatically probe the available ports\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T03:39:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T06:44:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T06:44:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"526db52fb534947166e3bc7182ce6cef8d506453","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n#1343 \r\n\r\nfix bugs for issue 1343\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apahe/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

null params in isMatch method in InvokeTelnetHandler.java\r\nadd unit-test in InvokeTelnetHandlerTest.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T03:25:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T05:46:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T05:46:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65d85e36119c1cc72c17e78c4624f37abcb91719","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0fd3bd27d9e4d0cbb9234018796b1a626b2da089","head":{"label":"sunby:issue1","ref":"issue1","sha":"0fd3bd27d9e4d0cbb9234018796b1a626b2da089","user":{"login":"sunby","id":9817127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTcxMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9817127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby","html_url":"https://github.com/sunby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1c16f78036b96582166c194d6142436399a1ce5a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
