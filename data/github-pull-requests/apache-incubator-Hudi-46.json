Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at relaxing current `MERGE INTO` constraints to permit limited casting operations w/in matched-on conditions by:\r\n\r\n - Stripping out superfluous symmetrical casting (`cast(target.id as string) = cast(source.id as string`)\r\n - Verifying that the incoming source dataset's primary-key could actually be up-casted to the target table's primary-key data-type w/o loss of precision (for ex, when `target.id` is of type `Int` and `source.id` is of type `Short`)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: Low**\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo docs update are required \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nadd integrity check of merged parquet file for HoodieMergeHandle.\r\n\r\nIn the current production environment, due to the instability of the cluster, it is very easy for hudi to

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `HoodieTable` is holding `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` that is setup not to reuse actual LogScanner and HFileReader used to read MT itself.\r\n\r\nThis is proving to be wasteful on a number of occasions already, including (not an exhaustive list):\r\n\r\n - #6373: Cleaner leveraging file-listing takes 5min, vs the MT based one taking **4h**\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n  - Eliminating `reuse` flag from the `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` ctor to make sure readers are always reused\r\n  - Holding `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` as `Broadcast` in HoodieTable to make sure it's being deserialized once per executor (instead of currently being once per _task_)\r\n  - Made `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` serializable object (still omitting the readers though)\r\n  - Restored `HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar` to be able to register serializer for `SerializableConfiguration`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: Low**\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocumentation update is required now specifying that `--conf spark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.spark.HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar` property will be mandatory\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the current implementation with other Protobuf users, there were a few asks around handling some types better.\r\n\r\n1. Handle unsigned longs as a decimal (backed by a fixed size byte array) in avro to allow users to query these fields within their lake without converting to an unsigned long after reading the data or when writing the query (currently unsigned long is just stored as a signed long). When the long is less than max signed long value, it is kept as a long to avoid unnecessary conversion overhead. \r\n2. Handle timestamps by converting them to a long with the timestamp-micros logical type in avro\r\n3. Make fields within a `oneOf` nullable since only one of them will ever be set\r\n4. Change the default settings for handling wrapped primitives to just treat them as nullable primitives\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDefault settings are updated but this feature is not yet released (part of 0.13.0 release)\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low **\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-27T03:31:41Z","updated_at":"2022-10-09T13:09:31Z","closed_at":"2022-10-07T22:32:38Z","merged_at":"2022-10-07T22:32:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d2c2853ea37ca8268f0d049460bedddde026216","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the logic to auto-tune the dedup parallelism.  Before this change, the write shuffle parallelism (`hoodie.insert|upsert|bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism`, default value as 200) is directly fed into the Spark's `reduceByKey` transformation.  The default parallelism 200 is too high if the input batch of records is small.  This has caused increased latency in the write operations when dedup is enabled, which also affects CI test finish time.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to limit the parallelism based on the number of partitions of the input RDD of records.  A new API `getNumPartitions` is added in `HoodieData` abstraction to retrieve the information.\r\n\r\n`TestHoodieSparkSqlWriter#testToWriteWithoutParametersIncludedInHoodieTableConfig` which does not have shuffle parallelism set:\r\nBefore this PR: dedup and related jobs (9, 11) take 16 seconds due to bloated parallelism even if upserting only one record.\r\n<img width=\"1762\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-24 at 14 16 30\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/192654574-ffe881c4-5dae-467e-bb79-1cd7600d5766.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter this PR: dedup and related jobs (33, 35) take less than 1 second.  Even the writing job (job 37 vs job 13 in the above screenshot) latency is reduced 5s to 2s.\r\n<img width=\"1762\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-26 at 18 46 25\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/192654601-552b62ff-8698-40d6-ace7-7eca81466d83.png\">\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: medium**\r\nNew unit tests and validation of the number of RDD partitions are added.\r\n\r\nThe PR is validated with the `TestHoodieSparkSqlWriter#testToWriteWithoutParametersIncludedInHoodieTableConfig` test and through Spark UI, as shown above, the parallelism for dedup and related jobs is auto-tuned.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo docs update is needed.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-27T02:02:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T05:05:33Z","closed_at":"2022-09-28T15:03:42Z","merged_at":"2022-09-28T15:03:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"c733079734a2c61867cfd160d9da53ff298fd028","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/f29b7651130535f6212f2f3917ad6d48800710cb","head":{"label":"yihua:HUDI-4924-auto-tune-dedup-parallelism","ref":"HUDI-4924-auto-tune-dedup-parallelism","sha":"f29b7651130535f6212f2f3917ad6d48800710cb","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196439401,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY0Mzk0MDE=","name":"hudi","full_name":"yihua/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yihua

When the amount of data is large and the parallelism is high, there is a certain network performance bottleneck, resulting in very slow tagloacation.\r\nHowever, hoodieBaseFile can be obtained directly through HoodieIndexUtils.getLatestBaseFilesForAllPartitions() in loadColumnRangesFromFiles(), so it can effectively improve the performance of TagLoaction of Bloom Index.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\n_Choose one.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `HoodieMetadataLogRecordReader` is flushing cache for every lookup it's doing, which led to multiple occasions of poor performance as MT had to be re-scanned over and over again, even though nothing really changed.\r\n\r\nThis PR rectifies that, additionally: \r\n\r\n - Making sure `LogRecordScanner` is not extended for MT (there's no reason for that, instead its configuration is simply expanded to accommodate for MT use-case)\r\n - Refining and cleaning up the API provided `HoodieMetadataLogRecordReader` \r\n - Avoiding unnecessary locking\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproved performance of metadata log record reader.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-24T00:10:52Z","updated_at":"2023-01-19T17:10:14Z","closed_at":"2023-01-19T17:10:13Z","merged_at":"2023-01-19T17:10:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8028a400ebe7a64d7745fae90e769306a8a07a7","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2177611461,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc3NjExNDYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"a6fcaf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf a user provides a recursive proto schema, it will fail when we write to parquet. We need to allow the user to specify how many levels of recursion they want before truncating the remaining data. \r\n\r\nMain changes to existing code:\r\n - ProtoClassBasedSchemaProvider tracks number of times a message descriptor is seen within a branch of the schema traversal\r\n - once the number of times that descriptor is seen exceeds the user provided limit, set the field to preset record that will contain two fields: 1) the remaining data serialized as a proto byte array, 2) the descriptors full name for context about what is in that byte array\r\n - Converting from a proto to an avro now accounts for this truncation of the input\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, I needed to change how the namespace was set for the Records within the Avro schema. Since we cannot repeat the exact same namespace + name, I made the namespace the path within the schema being traversed so each instance of a recursive message class will have a unique full name.\r\n\r\nMarking this as low risk since the protobuf support is scheduled for the 0.13.0 release\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low **\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have `FileSystemBasedLockProvier`, which relies on the atomic guarantee of the underlying file system. Specifically, only with filesystem's atomic rename & atomic create capability, the LockProvider can work properly.\r\n\r\n This PR enables Object store (e.g, AliyunOSS) as a lock provider.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo API change.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\nLOW.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nImplement consistent hashing bucket index for flink. This PR only covers the write core of the index, and the resizing implementation will be in another PR.\r\n\r\nThere are three main changes:\r\n- Extract common code of consistent hashing bucket index, to serve both Spark&Flink engine.\r\n- Have Flink engine write path adapt to consistent hashing bucket index, e.g., introduce `ConsistentBucketStreamWriteOperator `.\r\n- Consistent hashing clustering schedule plan for Flink.\r\n- Introduce the basic framework of `UpdateStrategy` for Flink, to handle conflict between concurrent clustering & update.\r\n- Introduce `FlinkDuplicateUpdateStrategy` for handle concurrent clustering (i.e., resizing) & write.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x]  Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-22T02:19:52Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T19:32:03Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter we landed https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6472, hive-sync in docker demo is broken. It fails w/ NoClassDefFoundError for LogicalType. Apparently, we have avro only as provided scope and hence it fails. Adding back the apache-avro, but w/o shading to hudi-hive-sync bundle. \r\n\r\nHere is the version of avro that spark pulls in. avro version for spark3.3 has been bumped accordingly in our pom. rest of the avro version matches. \r\n\r\n|Spark version| avro version|\r\n|-----------|-----|\r\n|2.4.8|1.8.2|\r\n|3.1.1| 1.8.2|\r\n|3.1.2| 1.8.2|\r\n|3.1.3| 1.8.2|\r\n|3.2.0| 1.10.2|\r\n|3.2.1| 1.10.2|\r\n|3.2.2| 1.10.2|\r\n|3.3.0| 1.11.1|\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nHive sync was failing w/o this patch. \r\nDocker demo fails w/o this patch.  \r\n\r\n**Risk level:  low **\r\n\r\n_Choose one. If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\nTests:\r\nTested that hive sync works with hive sync bundle and utilities slim bundle (tried bundles in two different ordering) and validated that hive sync succeeded. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T22:35:41Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T09:06:33Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T09:06:33Z","merged_at":"2022-09-29T09:06:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"986b63104d9919fcaec1d05d67d0b7368a91e7a9","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/95d5bc16716f6e553d2e34e779ef76e476161a22","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:docker_demo_hive_sync_fix","ref":"docker_demo_hive_sync_fix","sha":"95d5bc16716f6e553d2e34e779ef76e476161a22","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_ev

Change Logs\r\n\r\nContext: https://apache-hudi.slack.com/archives/C4D716NPQ/p1660215517081789\r\n\r\nMultiTableDeltastreamer currently supports single transformer class for all of the data being synced. And it can only be enabled or disabled as a whole. There is no support for enabling transformers for a select feed of data or to use different transformers for different feeds. This PR addresses the same.\r\n\r\nThe same feature is available in schemaprovider class through `hoodie.deltastreamer.schemaprovider.class` property in table level configs.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe impact audience are the confined to users of MultiTableDeltaStreamer and that too if they use transformers. And since this is a new feature, things should run as-is even if this change has been incorporated.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\nlow\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI
