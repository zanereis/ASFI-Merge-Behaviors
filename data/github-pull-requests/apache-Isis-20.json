changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when serializing HTML, newlines in elements descending from a pre tag were incorrectly skipped. That caused\nwhat should have been preformatted output to instead be a run of text.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1776\">jhy/jsoup#1776</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.1 [2022-May-15]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Change: removed previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#wholeOwnText() to retrieve the original (non-normalized) ownText of an Element. Also\nadded the :containsWholeOwnText(text) selector, to match against that. BR elements are now treated as newlines\nin the wholeText methods.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :matchesWholeText(regex) and :matchesWholeOwnText(regex) selectors, to match against whole\n(non-normalized, case sensitive) element text and own text, respectively.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when evaluating an XPath query against a context element, the complete document is now visible to the\nquery, vs only the context element's sub-tree. This enables support for queries outside (parent or sibling) the\nelement, e.g. ancestor-or-self::*.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1652\">jhy/jsoup#1652</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: allow a maxPaddingWidth on the indent level in OutputSettings when pretty printing. This defaults to\n30 to limit the indent level for very deeply nested elements, and may be disabled by setting to -1.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1655\">jhy/jsoup#1655</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when cloning a Node or an Element, the clone gets a cloned OwnerDocument containing only that clone, so\nas to preserve applicable settings, such as the Pretty Print settings.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/763\">jhy/jsoup#763</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a convenience method Jsoup.parse(File).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1693\">jhy/jsoup#1693</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in the NodeTraversor, added default implementations for NodeVisitor.tail() and NodeFilter.tail(), so</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases\">graphql-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>18.0</h2>\n<p>We are happy to announce v18.0 of graphql-java</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A18.0+is%3Aclosed\">https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A18.0+is%3Aclosed</a></p>\n<h1>Applied Directives</h1>\n<p>Graphql directives have two modes.  They can be <em>defined</em> in a schema</p>\n<pre lang=\"graphql\"><code>directive @example on FIELD_DEFINITION | ARGUMENT_DEFINITION\n</code></pre>\n<p>and they can be <em>applied</em> to  schema elements and query elements</p>\n<pre lang=\"graphql\"><code>type Query {\n   field(arg : String! ) @example\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we have a directive definition and cases where that directive is applied to an element.</p>\n<p>However when the <code>graphql.schema.GraphQLDirective</code> and <code>graphql.schema.GraphQLArgument</code> classes was created, we modelled this badly.  These classes should really represent a directive definition in schema only but we reused them to also be the representation of a directive and value arguments <em>applied</em> to another schema or query element.</p>\n<p>This modelling is wrong.  You can tell because we have javadoc comments like this in <code>graphql.schema.GraphQLArgument</code> saying a certain property is only applicable in certain call contexts.</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>    /**\n     * This is only used for applied directives, that is when this argument is on a {@link GraphQLDirective} applied to a schema or query element\n     *\n     * @return an input value with state for an applied directive\n     *\n     * @deprecated use {@link GraphQLAppliedDirectiveArgument} instead\n     */\n    @Deprecated\n    public @NotNull InputValueWithState getArgumentValue() {\n        return value;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we have decided to fix this bad class modelling in version 18.  We have introduced new classes</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>graphql.schema.GraphQLAppliedDirective</code></li>\n<li><code>graphql.schema.GraphQLAppliedDirectiveArgument</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>which represent an <em>applied</em> directive on a schema element and</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>graphql.execution.directives.QueryAppliedDirective</code></li>\n<li><code>graphql.execution.directives.QueryAppliedDirectiveArgument</code></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Support for composite types on properties (inline edit dialog)\r\n- [x] Support for composite types on action parameters (nested inline edit dialog)\r\n- [x] Inconsistent ScalarPanel null/isRequired handling - false positives/negatives\r\n- [x] Improve programming model for the _composite-value-mixin_ member name currently hard-coded to `updatec`\r\n- [x] Metamodel: add new _Member_ search scope to search mixins ONLY (vs INCLUDED or EXCLUDED)\r\n- [x] Optional Properties/Parameters not handled when null (UI).\r\n- [x] Missing option for clearing a composite-value parameter or property
