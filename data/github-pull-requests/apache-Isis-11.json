calls.</h2>\n<p>ApprovalTests only wants one call to <code>verify()</code> per test.\nThere are ways to go around this but if you call <code>verify</code> where it would want the exact same file name twice, it will now throw an exception.\nThis will make it easier for people to not be confused as most other testing frameworks allow you to put multiple assertions in the same test.</p>\n<h1>Backwards compatibility</h1>\n<p>There are some situations where you want to check that two different processes produce the same result.\nCalling <code>verify</code> multiple times in the same test can be a way to do this.\nIf you want to do that, we have provided two calls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Approvals.settings().allowMultipleVerifyCallsForThisClass()</code></li>\n<li><code>Approvals.settings().allowMultipleVerifyCallsForThisMethod()</code></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a

twice, it will now throw an exception.\nThis will make it easier for people to not be confused as most other testing frameworks allow you to put multiple assertions in the same test.</p>\n<h1>Backwards compatibility</h1>\n<p>There are some situations where you want to check that two different processes produce the same result.\nCalling <code>verify</code> multiple times in the same test can be a way to do this.\nIf you want to do that, we have provided two

Resource Leak Checker now issues a <code>required.method.not.known</code> error when an expression with type <code>@MustCallUnknown</code> has a must-call obligation (e.g., because it is a parameter annotated as <code>@Owning</code>).</p>\n<p>The Resource Leak Checker's default MustCall type for type variables has been changed from <code>@MustCallUnknown</code> to <code>@MustCall({})</code>.  This change reduces the number of false positive warnings in code that uses type variables but not resources.  However, it makes some code that uses type variables and resources unverifiable with any annotation.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation details:</strong></p>\n<p>Deprecated <code>ElementUtils.getSimpleNameOrDescription()</code> in favor of <code>getSimpleDescription()</code>.</p>\n<p>Renamed methods in <code>AnnotatedTypeMirror</code>.\nThe old versions are deprecated.
