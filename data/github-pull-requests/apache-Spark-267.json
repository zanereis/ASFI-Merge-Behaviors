What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23043\r\n\r\nThere are 4 places we need to deal with NaN and -0.0:\r\n1. comparison expressions. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be treated as same. Different NaNs should be treated as same. This should be true for prefix comparator as well, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23334 fixes it.\r\n2. Join keys. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be treated as same. Different NaNs should be treated as same.\r\n3. grouping keys. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be assigned to the same group. Different NaNs should be assigned to the same group.\r\n4. window partition keys. `-0.0` and `0.0` should be treated as same. Different NaNs should be treated as same.\r\n\r\nThe case 1 is OK. Our comparison already handles NaN and -0.0, and for struct/array/map, we will recursively compare the fields/elements.\r\n\r\nCase 2, 3 and 4 are problematic, as they compare `UnsafeRow` binary directly, and different NaNs have different binary representation, and the same thing happens for -0.0 and 0.0.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, a simple solution is: normalize float/double when building unsafe data (`UnsafeRow`, `UnsafeArrayData`, `UnsafeMapData`). Then we don't need to worry about it anymore.\r\n\r\nFollowing this direction, this PR moves the handling of NaN and -0.0 from `Platform` to `UnsafeWriter`, so that places like `UnsafeRow.setFloat` will not handle them, which reduces the perf overhead. It's also easier to add comments explaining why we do it in `UnsafeWriter`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we encode a Decimal from external source we don't check for overflow. That method is useful not only in order to enforce that we can represent the correct value in the specified range, but it also changes the underlying data to the right precision/scale.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we encode a Decimal from external source we don't check for overflow. That method is useful not only in order to enforce that we can represent the correct value in the specified range, but it also changes the underlying data to the right precision/scale. Since in our code generation we assume that a decimal has exactly the same precision and scale of its data type, missing to enforce it can lead to corrupted output/results when there are subsequent transformations.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`1. The shuffle dependency specifies no aggregation or output ordering.`\r\nIf the shuffle dependency specifies aggregation, but it only aggregates at the reduce-side, serialized shuffle can still be used.\r\n`3. The shuffle produces fewer than 16777216 output partitions.`\r\nIf the number of output partitions is 16777216 , we can use serialized shuffle.\r\n\r\nWe can see this mothod:

tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-04T10:26:04Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T01:41:50Z","closed_at":"2018-12-05T01:41:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d8a060acbbea98a83db588ad4c7a045114f9fd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3ede8be1a9073f057cc46fb82eacd7fa3ec36c6","head":{"label":"10110346:locs_transient","ref":"locs_transient","sha":"b3ede8be1a9073f057cc46fb82eacd7fa3ec36c6","user":{"login":"10110346","id":24688163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg4MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24688163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346","html_url":"https://github.com/10110346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77023032,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzAyMzAzMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"10110346/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"10110346","id":24688163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Njg4MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24688163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346","html_url":"https://github.com/10110346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/10110346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/10110346/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently if user provides data schema, partition column values are converted as per it. But if the conversion failed, e.g. converting string to int, the column value is null. \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to throw exception in such case, instead of converting into null value silently:\r\n1. These null partition column values doesn't make sense to users in most cases. It is better to show the conversion failure, and then users can adjust the schema or ETL jobs to fix it.\r\n2. There are always exceptions on such conversion failure for non-partition data columns. Partition columns should have the same behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can reproduce the case above as following:\r\n```\r\n/tmp/testDir\r\n├── p=bar\r\n└── p=foo\r\n```\r\nIf we run:\r\n```\r\nval schema

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor better test coverage, this pr proposed to use the 4 mixed config sets of `WHOLESTAGE_CODEGEN_ENABLED` and `CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE`  when running `SQLQueryTestSuite`:\r\n1. WHOLESTAGE_CODEGEN_ENABLED=true, CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE=CODEGEN_ONLY\r\n2. WHOLESTAGE_CODEGEN_ENABLED=false, CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE=CODEGEN_ONLY\r\n3. WHOLESTAGE_CODEGEN_ENABLED=true, CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE=NO_CODEGEN\r\n4. WHOLESTAGE_CODEGEN_ENABLED=false, CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE=NO_CODEGEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pr also moved some existing tests into `ExplainSuite` because explain output results are different between codegen and interpreter modes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

predicate subqueries (IN/EXISTS) are converted to Joins at the end of optimizer in RewritePredicateSubquery. This change moves the rewrite close to beginning of optimizer. The original idea was to keep the subquery expressions in Filter form so that we can push them down as deep as possible. One disadvantage is that, after the subqueries are rewritten in join form, they are not subjected to further optimizations. In this change, we convert the subqueries to join form early in the rewrite phase and then add logic to push the left-semi and left-anti joins down like we do for normal filter ops. I can think of the following advantages : \r\n\r\n1. We will produce consistent optimized plans for subqueries written using SQL dialect and data frame apis or queries using left semi/anti joins directly.\r\n2. Will hopefully make it easier to do the next phase of de-correlations when we open up more cases of de-correlation. In this case, it would be beneficial to expose the rewritten queries to all the other optimization rules, i think.\r\n3. We can now hopefully get-rid of PullupCorrelatedPredicates rule and combine this with RewritePredicateSubquery. I haven't tried it. Will take it on a followup.\r\n\r\n(P.S Thanks to Natt for his original work in [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17520). I have based this pr on his work)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nA new suite LeftSemiOrAntiPushDownSuite is added. Existing subquery suite should verify the results and any potential regressions.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-03T22:25:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T00:06:26Z","closed_at":"2020-01-04T00:06:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d089b9e9c6a683d857654789b5222a908ef687c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4bb126472eb5a808a3ae94bcfb59e0674e01217","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:SPARK-19712-NEW","ref":"SPARK-19712-NEW","sha":"f4bb126472eb5a808a3ae94bcfb59e0674e01217","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdjust the batch write API to match the read API refactor after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23086\r\n\r\nThe doc with high-level ideas:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1vI26UEuDpVuOjWw4WPoH2T6y8WAekwtI7qoowhOFnI4/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nBasically it renames `BatchWriteSupportProvider` to `SupportsBatchWrite`, and make it extend `Table`. Renames `WriteSupport` to `Write`. It also cleans up some code as batch API is completed.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the test from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22688 . Now data source must return a table for read/write.\r\n\r\nA few notes about future changes:\r\n1. We will create `SupportsStreamingWrite` later for streaming APIs\r\n2. We will create `SupportsBatchReplaceWhere`, `SupportsBatchAppend`, etc. for the new end-user write APIs. I think streaming APIs would remain to use `OutputMode`, and new end-user write APIs will apply to batch only, at least in the near future.\r\n3. We will remove `SaveMode` from data source API: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26356\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-03T15:23:45Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T21:56:50Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T21:56:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6267fff092b5ca2854b07c6da9b6243ef467368","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/693fb986e54ef8f7d09d6c028d18df50d2db117e","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:refactor-batch","ref":"refactor-batch","sha":"693fb986e54ef8f7d09d6c028d18df50d2db117e","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Implement `SQLShuffleWriteMetricsReporter` on the SQL side as the customized `ShuffleWriteMetricsReporter`.\r\n2. Add shuffle write metrics to `ShuffleExchangeExec`, and use these metrics to create corresponding `SQLShuffleWriteMetricsReporter` in shuffle dependency.\r\n3. Rework on `ShuffleMapTask` to add new class named `ShuffleWriteProcessor` which control shuffle write process, we use sql shuffle write metrics by customizing a ShuffleWriteProcessor on SQL side.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd UT in SQLMetricsSuite.\r\nManually test locally, update screen shot to document attached in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nSpark has extension points API to allow third parties to extend Spark with custom optimization rules. The current API does not allow fine grain control on when the optimization rule will be exercised. In the current API,  there is no way to add a batch to the optimization using the SparkSessionExtensions API, similar to the postHocOptimizationBatches in SparkOptimizer.\r\nIn our use cases, we have optimization rules that we want to add as extensions to a batch in a specific order.\r\n\r\nChanges: \r\nAdd two new methods to SparkSessionExtensions to: \r\n- Inject optimizer rule in a specific order\r\n- Inject optimizer batch. \r\n\r\nDesign details is here: \r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1m7rQZ9OZFl0MH5KS12CiIg3upLJSYfsA/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- New unit tests have been added to the SparkSessionExtensionSuite\r\n- Ran the sql, hive, catalyst unit tests without any issues.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `JsonInferSchema` class is extended to support `TimestampType` inferring from string fields in JSON input:\r\n- If the `prefersDecimal` option is set to `true`, it tries to infer decimal type from the string field.\r\n- If decimal type inference fails or `prefersDecimal` is disabled, `JsonInferSchema` tries to infer `TimestampType`.\r\n- If timestamp type inference fails, `StringType` is returned as the inferred type.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test suite - `JsonInferSchemaSuite` to check date and timestamp types inferring from JSON using `JsonInferSchema` directly. A few tests were added `JsonSuite` to check type merging and roundtrip tests. This changes was tested by `JsonSuite`, `JsonExpressionsSuite` and `JsonFunctionsSuite` as well.

valid date format string.\r\n\r\nI think we shall avoid casting to String type if Date/timestamp string literal value can be converted to a valid date or timestamp,  and we shall convert the filter right expression column to string type only if  filter expression with string literal cannot be converted to data/timestamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUsing Existing Unit testcase and manual testing.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-01T18:45:07Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T08:53:22Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T08:53:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15d19dbff99ef9fa79849649c003f9732a76645c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f1b2493d92c4340d02d4958da38d9ff8c1ab612","head":{"label":"sujith71955:master_filter_perf","ref":"master_filter_perf","sha":"9f1b2493d92c4340d02d4958da38d9ff8c1ab612","user":{"login":"sujith71955","id":12999161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12999161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955","html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79292929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTI5MjkyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sujith71955/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sujith71955","id":12999161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12999161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955","html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn my local setup, I set log4j root category as ERROR (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27781187/how-to-stop-info-messages-displaying-on-spark-console , first item show up if we google search \"set spark log level\".) When I run such command \r\n``` \r\nspark-submit --class foo bar.jar \r\n``` \r\nNothing shows up, and the script exits.  \r\n\r\nAfter quick investigation, I think the log level for ClassNotFoundException/NoClassDefFoundError in SparkSubmit should be ERROR instead of WARN. Since the whole process exit because of the exception/error.\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20925, the message is not controlled by `log4j.rootCategory`. \r\n\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPartition column name is required to be unique under the same directory.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's a bad idea to use case class as public API, as it has a very wide surface. For example, the `copy` method, its fields, the companion object, etc.\r\n\r\nFor a particular case, `UserDefinedFunction`. It has a private constructor, and I believe we only want users to access a few methods:`apply`, `nullable`, `asNonNullable`, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, all its fields, and `copy` method, and the companion object are public unexpectedly. As a result, we made many tricks to work around the binary compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to only make interfaces public, and hide implementations behind with a private class. Now `UserDefinedFunction` is a pure trait, and the concrete implementation is `SparkUserDefinedFunction`, which is private.\r\n\r\nChanging class to interface is not binary compatible(but source compatible), so 3.0 is a good chance to do it.\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR to go with this direction. If it's accepted, I'll create a umbrella JIRA and fix all the public case classes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-29T13:55:16Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T17:50:47Z","closed_at":"2018-12-02T02:50:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63381c38d7a2de1ff634babc0e6e0e34dd6ba224","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad6605e5f049cc21ed5754b754b695bcac6d4502","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:udf","ref":"udf","sha":"ad6605e5f049cc21ed5754b754b695bcac6d4502","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

change modifies the logic in the SecurityManager to do two\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n- generate unique app secrets also when k8s is being used\r\n- only store the secret in the user's UGI on YARN\r\n\r\nThe latter is needed so that k8s won't unnecessarily create\r\nk8s secrets for the UGI credentials when only the auth token\r\nis stored there.\r\n\r\nOn the k8s side, the secret is propagated to executors using\r\nan environment variable instead. This ensures it works in both\r\nclient and cluster mode.\r\n\r\nSecurity doc was updated to mention the feature and clarify that\r\nproper access control in k8s should be enabled for it to be secure.","created_at":"2018-11-28T21:25:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T20:38:23Z","closed_at":"2018-12-06T22:21:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f8e12389305afbc3c2be586f77e3d4cad78f1ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/791b5ee88d2f3c856aad640f662472124e098c66","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-26194","ref":"SPARK-26194","sha":"791b5ee88d2f3c856aad640f662472124e098c66","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes `InSet` expressions for byte, short, integer, date types. It is a follow-up on PR #21442 from @dbtsai.  \r\n\r\n`In` expressions are compiled into a sequence of if-else statements, which results in O\\(n\\) time complexity. `InSet` is an optimized version of `In`, which is supposed to improve the performance if all values are literals and the number of elements is big enough. However, `InSet` actually worsens the performance in many cases due to various reasons.\r\n\r\nThe main idea of this PR is to use Java `switch` statements to significantly improve the performance of `InSet` expressions for bytes, shorts, ints, dates. All `switch` statements are compiled into `tableswitch` and `lookupswitch` bytecode instructions. We will have O\\(1\\) time complexity if our case values are compact and `tableswitch` can be used. Otherwise, `lookupswitch` will give us O\\(log n\\).\r\n\r\nLocally, I tried Spark `OpenHashSet` and primitive collections from `fastutils` in order to solve the boxing issue in `InSet`. Both options significantly decreased the memory consumption and `fastutils` improved the time compared to `HashSet` from Scala. However, the switch-based approach was still more than two times faster even on 500+ non-compact elements.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that applying the switch-based approach on less than 10 elements gives a relatively minor improvement compared to the if-else approach. Therefore, I placed the switch-based logic into `InSet` and added a new config to track when it is applied. Even if we migrate to primitive collections at some point, the switch logic will be still faster unless the number of elements is really big. Another option is to have a separate `InSwitch` expression. However, this would mean we need to modify other places (e.g., `DataSourceStrategy`).\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-3.html#jvms-3.10) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10287700/difference-between-jvms-lookupswitch-and-tableswitch) for more information.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not cover long values as Java `switch` statements cannot be used on them. However, we can have a follow-up PR with an approach similar to binary search.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere are new tests that verify the logic of the proposed optimization.\r\n\r\nThe performance was evaluated using existing benchmarks. This PR was also tested on an EC2 instance (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_191-b12 on Linux 4.14.77-70.59.amzn1.x86_64, Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2686 v4 @ 2.30GHz). \r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- [This link](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/langtools/file/30db5e0aaf83/src/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/jvm/Gen.java#l1153) contains source code that decides between `tableswitch` and `lookupswitch`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR puts in a limit on the size of a debug string generated for a tree node.  Helps to fix out of memory errors when large plans have huge debug strings.   In addition to SPARK-26103, this should also address SPARK-23904 and SPARK-25380.  AN alternative solution was proposed in #23076, but that solution doesn't address all the cases that can cause a large query.  This limit is only on calls treeString that don't pass a Writer, which makes it play nicely with #22429, #23018 and #23039.  Full plans can be written to files, but truncated plans will be used when strings are held in memory, such as for the UI.\r\n\r\n- A new configuration parameter called spark.sql.debug.maxPlanLength was added to control the length of the plans.\r\n- When plans are truncated, \"...\" is printed to indicate that it isn't a full plan\r\n- A warning is printed out the first time a truncated plan is displayed. The warning explains what happened and how to adjust the limit.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were created for the new SizeLimitedWriter.  Also a unit test for TreeNode was created that checks that a long plan is correctly truncated.","created_at":"2018-11-28T18:04:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T01:13:11Z","closed_at":"2019-03-13T17:01:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9db2aa575e1e54af145e694e6f2cd9b99f024e80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4afa26baf8580bf5f630d0332e4ab49b243b434","head":{"label":"DaveDeCaprio:text-plan-size","ref":"text-plan-size","sha":"e4afa26baf8580bf5f630d0332e4ab49b243b434","user":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79563979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTU2Mzk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"DaveDeCaprio/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix a regression introduced in: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21004/files#r236998030\r\n\r\nIf user specifies schema, Spark don't need to infer data type for of partition columns, otherwise the data type might not match with the one user provided.\r\nE.g. for partition directory `p=4d`, after data type inference  the column value will be `4.0`.\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26188 for more details.\r\n\r\nNote that user specified schema **might not cover all the data columns**:\r\n```\r\nval schema = new StructType()\r\n  .add(\"id\", StringType)\r\n  .add(\"ex\", ArrayType(StringType))\r\nval df = spark.read\r\n  .schema(schema)\r\n  .format(\"parquet\")\r\n  .load(src.toString)\r\n\r\nassert(df.schema.toList === List(\r\n  StructField(\"ex\", ArrayType(StringType)),\r\n  StructField(\"part\", IntegerType), // inferred partitionColumn dataType\r\n  StructField(\"id\", StringType))) // used user provided partitionColumn dataType\r\n```\r\nFor the missing columns in user specified schema, Spark still need to infer their data types if `partitionColumnTypeInferenceEnabled` is enabled.\r\n\r\nTo implement the partially inference, refactor `PartitioningUtils.parsePartitions`  and pass the user specified schema as parameter to cast partition values.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-28T16:21:46Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T07:16:08Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T04:05:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c57e42eb8652bb5a21c9979e9adf17fdfa8c49e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23165/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23165/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23165/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36c65e5a4d8b173b331aee2d5658e1b25e6ce795","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixFileIndex","ref":"fixFileIndex","sha":"36c65e5a4d8b173b331aee2d5658e1b25e6ce795","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently spark always requires a local sort before writing to output table on partition/bucket columns (see `write.requiredOrdering` in `FileFormatWriter.scala`), which is unnecessary, and can be avoided by keeping multiple output writers concurrently in `FileFormatDataWriter.scala`.\r\n\r\nThis pr is first doing hash-based write, then falling back to sort-based write (current implementation) when number of opened writer exceeding a threshold (controlled by a config). Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. (hash-based write) Maintain mapping between file path and output writer, and re-use writer for writing input row. In case of the number of opened output writers exceeding a threshold (can be changed by a config), we go to 2.\r\n\r\n2. (sort-based write) Sort the rest of input rows (use the same sorter in SortExec). Then writing the rest of sorted rows, and we can close the writer on the fly, in case no more rows for current file path.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test in `DataFrameReaderWriterSuite.scala`. Existing test like `SQLMetricsSuite.scala` would already exercise the code path of executor write metrics.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-28T10:01:48Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T00:13:42Z","closed_at":"2020-05-17T00:13:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"144b7e6b965ec10450d19b362f763bfbf3996ec1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23163/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23163/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23163/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c544abf4c30474d504b74f2d4c252dc55f1ba4e","head":{"label":"c21:more-writers","ref":"more-writers","sha":"7c544abf4c30474d504b74f2d4c252dc55f1ba4e","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add `maxFields` parameter to all functions involved in creation of textual representation of spark plans such as `simpleString` and `verboseString`. New parameter restricts number of fields converted to truncated strings. Any elements beyond the limit will be dropped and replaced by a `\"... N more fields\"` placeholder. The threshold is bumped up to `Int.MaxValue` for `toFile()`.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test to `QueryExecutionSuite` which checks `maxFields` impacts on number of truncated fields in `LocalRelation`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-27T22:51:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:53Z","closed_at":"2018-12-27T10:17:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df532823bd6ec7e062bea1ca917997c3225c9a40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6ad27581d4a90384d44a729423b34383966c505","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:to-file-max-fields","ref":"to-file-max-fields","sha":"c6ad27581d4a90384d44a729423b34383966c505","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the 'spark.history.fs.inProgressOptimization.enabled' is true, inProgress application's last updated time is not getting updated in the History UI. Also, during the cleaning time, InProgress application is getting removed from the listing, even if the last updated time is within the cleaning threshold time.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, if the fastInprogressOptimization enabled, we update the `lastUpdateTime` of the application as last scan time. This will update the `lastUpdateTime` in the historyUI and also while cleaning, it won't remove if the updateTime is within the cleaning interval  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nContinuous processing is waiting on epochs which are not yet complete (for example one partition is not making progress) and stores pending items in queues. These queues are unbounded and can consume up all the memory easily. In this PR I've added `spark.sql.streaming.continuous.epochBacklogQueueSize` configuration possibility to make them bounded. If the related threshold reached then the query will stop with `IllegalStateException`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting + additional unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use **java.time API** for parsing timestamps and dates from CSV content with microseconds precision. ~~The SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled` allow to switch back to previous behaviour with using `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`/`FastDateFormat` for parsing/generating timestamps/dates.~~\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by `UnivocityParserSuite`, `CsvExpressionsSuite`, `CsvFunctionsSuite` and `CsvSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-26T23:02:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-23T19:12:38Z","closed_at":"2018-12-04T14:40:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b604d25ec8b2b5cb92343ee513d169b0583d18f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60c0974261c947c0838457c40f4fe0e64d17ca15","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:time-parser","ref":"time-parser","sha":"60c0974261c947c0838457c40f4fe0e64d17ca15","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a maven plugin and wrapper script to use scalafmt to format files that differ from git master.\r\n\r\nIntention is for contributors to be able to use this to automate fixing code style, not to include it in build pipeline yet.\r\n\r\nIf this PR is accepted, I'd make a different PR to update the code style section of https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html to mention the script\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by modifying a few files and running ./dev/scalafmt then checking that ./dev/scalastyle still passed.","created_at":"2018-11-26T20:18:42Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T19:36:41Z","closed_at":"2018-11-29T14:58:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ff07db3ab5d90040019a0f0e68b68fc8e253cf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92dd105b4f2d3be2d2059f5a983dab01339e81a9","head":{"label":"koeninger:scalafmt","ref":"scalafmt","sha":"92dd105b4f2d3be2d2059f5a983dab01339e81a9","user":{"login":"koeninger","id":98311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger","html_url":"https://github.com/koeninger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26181117,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjE4MTExNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"koeninger/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"koeninger","id":98311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger","html_url":"https://github.com/koeninger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/koeninger/spark-1","description":"Mirror
