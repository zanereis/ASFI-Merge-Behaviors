discussion with @mistercrunch, looks like #1213 introduced some slowdowns. I believe it's related to increased use of `dag.get_task()` which iterates over all tasks in `dag.tasks`. For example: https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/1213/files#diff-a32a363fa616685db3bfefba947535b2R1767\n\nThe solution is to replace the list of tasks with a `{task_id: task}` dict. Adding a `tasks` property that returns a list of the dict's values means all other uses of `dag.tasks` should work.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T00:12:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:40:48Z","closed_at":"2016-04-13T21:42:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14d53ec2d0b4448d9163c290684f2a4242520046","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/81bf781d5c12c67a73440c8153e2fdec6752bc1f","head":{"label":"jlowin:task-dict","ref":"task-dict","sha":"81bf781d5c12c67a73440c8153e2fdec6752bc1f","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

PR fixes the comment to match code: open_slots = 128.\n\nI am wondering what is the thought process behind setting open_slots to 128. Since the function is trying to prioritizing queues for an executor, it would make sense to derive the value of open_slots according to the the config flag 'parallelism' when no pools are created, and then subtract the number of running TIs that are not in any pools. And if we want to set a hard cap of 128 during prioritization, perhaps we can also document it somewhere to prevent surprises.\n\nPerhaps I am missing something here, so just want to clarify.

The idea is to make writing DAGfiles easier and less verbose, particularly where code gets extremely repetitive.\n\nAlso there is a big update to the \"Concepts\" doc, which was getting stale, including tips for writing airflow code.\n\nThe new features are well summarized (with examples!) in the new docs page, but briefly:\n1. DAG assignment can be deferred until after an Operator is created\n2. DAG assignment can be inferred from setting a relationship with an Operator that already has a DAG assigned\n3. DAGs can be used as context managers to assign Operators \n4. Operators and DAGs can be composed (setting upstream/downstream/assignment relationships) with the `>>` and `<<` bitshift operators\n5. Operators have a default owner: `Airflow` (a minor thing, but assigning owners over and over was annoying. In theory users can make a `policy` to require a different owner if they choose.)\n\nIn short, to show it all off, this is now a valid (if extreme) Airflow DAGfile:\n\n``` python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators import DummyOperator, BashOperator, PythonOperator\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# this context manager is superfluous because the dag \n# is also part of the composition pipeline\n#\n# also note that context manager objects enter globals() \n# as long as the \"as\" statement is present, so this DAG \n# would be loaded by airflow\nwith DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1)) as dag:\n    (\n        dag # alternatively, this line is unnecessary because of the context manager\n        >> DummyOperator(task_id='dummy_1')\n        >> BashOperator(\n            task_id='bash_1',\n            bash_command='echo \"HELLO!\"')\n        >> PythonOperator(\n            task_id='python_1',\n            python_callable=lambda: print(\"GOODBYE!\"))\n    )\n\n```\n\nNB: Had to remove one unit test (the infamous \"trap executor error\" that has caused some confusion) -- it relied on being able to raise a very unusual error and deferred dag assignment \"fixed\" the problem I was taking advantage of. I can't find another stable way to break the

will render dicts and walk through replacing templates. However, the logic in `render_template_from_field` assumes that all the values will be strings. If any values are non strings the function will raise an AirflowException.\n\nThis PR isn't designed to be merged - it contains a few examples of broken test cases. The last two tests are the ones of note:\n- fails with an `AirflowException` when `False` is a value within the templated dict\n- when given `{{ False }}` as a template it returns `False` as a string\n\nI'm not sure how easy the later one is to fix, but in the event the value isn't a string, IMHO it should warn or just accept it silently rather than fail.\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T18:06:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T13:16:33Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T13:16:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02cdfa97865048d9c963f9f11a3a98ab70690f7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6d034eae79f27486f685a3b5dfce3c1b3f4b739e","head":{"label":"withnale:rendering_test","ref":"rendering_test","sha":"6d034eae79f27486f685a3b5dfce3c1b3f4b739e","user":{"login":"withnale","id":1526703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjY3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1526703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale","html_url":"https://github.com/withnale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55398059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTM5ODA1OQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"withnale/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"withnale","id":1526703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjY3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1526703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale","html_url":"https://github.com/withnale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/withnale/airflow","description":"Airflow

However, without customizing `__eq__` and `__hash__`, the following two lines have no effect, never removing elements from `queued_tis` leading to infinite retries on failure.

However, due to the scheduler loop swallowing all exceptions, our scheduler was dead for hours looping over this error:\n\n```\n[2016-04-03 19:31:57.721295] ERROR:airflow.jobs.SchedulerJob:(sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError) Can't reconnect until invalid transaction is rolled back [SQL: '...']\n```\n\nI know there's a param to restart the scheduler every N loops, but we don't have that turned on because we found that the scheduler would reboot and schedule the same tasks many times over, leading to a large celery queue depth.\n\nI'm proposing this patch that lets the exception propagate so the scheduler can die and restart fresh. If the scheduler is hitting some kind of persistent error, dying quickly is still desirable since that can let us detect a flapping

For discussion at present. Not expecting this PR to be merged as-is_\n## Allow Operators to specify SKIPPED status internally\n\nAt present there is no clean way to specify that a downstream tasks should be skipped. The current options are:\n- generate an Exception for an Operator but this is messy since the task will flag as ERROR in the web interface. We only want Exceptions to occur when things are not 'working as expected' and someone might need to investigate\n- use the BranchOperator or ShortCircuit operator. However, both of these modify the Session directly and do not honour the DAG properly. For example, if an Operator is marked with 'one_success' this will never get run because it is artificially marked as SKIPPED, even if one of it's other upstream dependencies is successful.\n\nRather than have operators manipulate the session directly this should be provided centrally.\n#### PR: Specify SKIPPED via Exception\n\nThe following PullRequest implements an Exception (AirflowSkipException - although since it isn't flagging an error state maybe a name change?) which when generated by an Operator indicates that the job completed without errors but should not be considered as successful.\n\nThe scheduler during it's normal DAG traversal looking for task instances to schedule will the see the state 'SKIPPED' and will use this in its decision making.\n\nAn example DAG is provided which shows two distinct trees using this approach. One of them includes a join using trigger_rule='all_success' and the other uses the rule='one_success', which probably explains things better than I can. In this circumstance, the DummySkipOperator just raises AirflowSkipException immediately. The example DAG graph from the webserver can be seen below:\n\n![example workflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1526703/14243593/6fb706b6-fa4e-11e5-8c8e-d04f98f54641.png)\n\nI have also included an additional parameter to the BaseSensorOperator called soft_fail (defaults to false). If this is set to true, the sensor will error with a SKIPPED rather than an error. This should allow general sensors to encapsulate optional logic without generating errors on the DAG webserver frontpage.\n","created_at":"2016-04-04T09:24:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T23:12:59Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T17:23:49Z","merged_at":"2016-04-06T17:23:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"81ff5cccb7bbf90b93c1fb3eebb9e381b5f7baa1","assignee":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/81b93d378f34bad6b70fb2686839982a08dba091","head":{"label":"withnale:skip_exception","ref":"skip_exception","sha":"81b93d378f34bad6b70fb2686839982a08dba091","user":{"login":"withnale","id":1526703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjY3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1526703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale","html_url":"https://github.com/withnale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55398059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTM5ODA1OQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"withnale/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"withnale","id":1526703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjY3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1526703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale","html_url":"https://github.com/withnale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/withnale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/withnale/airflow","description":"Airflow

#1238 for details.\n\nThis PR replaces Airflow's import machinery with standard Python imports. This has an impact in four places:\n\n`airflow.hooks.*`\n`airflow.operators.*`\n`airflow.contrib.hooks.*`\n`airflow.contrib.operators.*`\n\nOperators that could formerly be accessed from these directories must now be accessed explicitly from submodules:\n\n``` python\nfrom airflow.operators import PigOperator # NO\nfrom airflow.operators.pig_operator import PigOperator # YES\n```\n\nOld style imports _will still work_ but will warn:\n\n``` bash\nIn [4]: airflow.operators.PigOperator\n/Users/jlowin/anaconda3/bin/ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: PigOperator: Importing \nPigOperator directly from 'airflow.operators' has been deprecated. Please import \nfrom 'airflow.operators.[operator_module]' instead. Support for direct imports will \nbe dropped entirely in Airflow 2.0.\n  #!/bin/bash /Users/jlowin/anaconda3/bin/python.app\n\nOut[4]: pig_operator.PigOperator\n```\n\n`run_unit_tests.sh` exports an environment variable `AIRFLOW_USE_NEW_IMPORTS` which turns off the old-style (deprecated) imports completely. Therefore, unit tests must use the new style. **I've tried to adjust the tests already but there are some I can't test locally so I will see what Travis has issues with and make adjustments.**\n\nPlugins are handled similarly. Let's say the user creates a plugin `MyPlugin` with some operators. Currently those operators are available at `airflow.operators.*`. Through this PR, that behavior is maintained (through Airflow 2.0) but a new module is dynamically created with the operators at `airflow.operators.myplugin.*`\n\nLastly, I took advantage of the fact I was going into lots of files to add licenses to all hooks and operators.\n","created_at":"2016-04-01T18:58:51Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T13:18:04Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T11:57:29Z","merged_at":"2016-06-17T11:57:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"f26b7a25d9c4632af68d9d64ac5f4a929a44f426","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f26b7a25d9c4632af68d9d64ac5f4a929a44f426","head":{"label":"jlowin:standard-imports","ref":"standard-imports","sha":"f26b7a25d9c4632af68d9d64ac5f4a929a44f426","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

Handling queued/retried tasks in `BackfillJob`\n   - queued tasks never ran\n   - retried tasks were sometimes viewed as errors\n2. Handling queued tasks in `SchedulerJob`\n   - Scheduler tried to run ALL queued tasks, including those from other jobs, causing collisions and confusion. Now it only schedules queued tasks from its own executor, by examining the executor's `events_buffer`.\n3. Handling deadlocked tasks in `BackfillJob`\n   - If the backfill gets into a situation where none of the tasks can run, it exits with a helpful message. Previously it looped forever.\n4. Fixed handling of `depends_on_past` in `BackfillJob`\n   - previously, this was handled by automatically overriding start dates to effectively coerce them into ignoring their depends_on_past parameter. This was fragile and didn't always make it into nested executor instructions. Instead, this PR makes it possible to explicitly ignore ONLY `depends_on_past` dependencies when determining if a task can run. Users can tell a BackfillJob that they want to `ignore_first_depends_on_past` if they desire. The default is not to do this (but the helpful deadlock error message will tell users if that's the reason their tasks aren't running).\n   - The command line parameter to ignore `depends_on_past` is `-I` or `--ignore_depends_on_past` (for `airflow run`) or `--ignore_first_depends_on_past` (for `airflow backfill`)\n5. Fixed determination of DagRun states\n   - previously, DagRuns were failed as soon as a task failed and marked successful if all tasks succeeded/skipped. That's no good, because tasks can fail and other tasks can respond with triggers or retries, but in the current system the dagrun would terminate immediately and those tasks wouldn't run. \n   - Now:\n   - dagruns FAIL when any of the root tasks FAIL\n   - dagruns SUCCEED when all of the root tasks SUCCEED/SKIP\n   - dagruns FAIL when all active dagruns are deadlocked (no tasks can run).\n6. Fixed issue where triggers were not respected by BackfillJob\n   - once a task failed, the backfill removed all of its downstream tasks from consideration no matter what their triggers were\n","created_at":"2016-04-01T16:05:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T18:43:05Z","closed_at":"2016-04-03T12:34:10Z","merged_at":"2016-04-03T12:34:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"a301ff549df75f698fa90782f24cbbe85f73373a","assignee":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c1eb83adbf9d4371dab7dd545c593cc5a853fb8b","head":{"label":"jlowin:subdag_pool_issue_1225","ref":"subdag_pool_issue_1225","sha":"c1eb83adbf9d4371dab7dd545c593cc5a853fb8b","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

tracked this one down! Closes #1199\n\nWhen tasks run, they try to catch any errors and, if there are any, mark themselves failed. In addition,\n`SequentialExecutor` and `LocalExecutor` both use `subprocess.Popen` to run Airflow commands, then `wait()` for the command to return. If an exception is raised, they mark the task as failed; otherwise they mark it as a success.\n\nThe problem here is that `Popen` doesn't actually raise errors -- you have to check the `returncode` explicitly. That means that Executors always return 'SUCCESS' for their commands (even when the command fails).\n\nThis is usually not an issue because a task's own status takes precedence over the executor's status; if the task reports failure and the executor reports success, failure wins. However, sometimes this IS a problem (as described in #1199) when an error is raised before the task even has a chance to run. In that case, the task reports no status and the executor reports `SUCCESS`. There is a trap for this case in `jobs.py` but unfortunately it leads to an infinite loop because the task is simply rescheduled.\n\nThis PR:\n1. modifies `SequentialExecutor` and `LocalExecutor` to use `subprocess.check_call()` instead of `subprocess.Popen().wait()`. Check_call raises `CalledProcessError` if the command returncode is not 0 OR if there is a genuine error calling the function.\n2. Checks for the case when TI says it's running but executor says it failed (as described by @mistercrunch [here](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/1199#issuecomment-200184468)\n3. In case all else fails, monitors the \"Unusual circumstances\" block of `jobs.py` to see if an `airflow run` command failed more than 3 times. If it does, it intervenes and marks the task as failed. This prevents the infinite loop.\n\nThis DAG demonstrates the issue (inspired by #1168). It (illegally) changes the name of its subdag, which means the subdag can't be found and an error is raised before any tasks run. In the current Airflow master, this DAG loops forever. \n\n``` python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators import SubDagOperator\nfrom airflow.example_dags.subdags.subdag import subdag\n\nargs = {\n    'owner': 'airflow',\n    'start_date': datetime(2016, 1, 1),\n}\n\ndag = DAG(\n    dag_id='test_raise_subdag_error',\n
