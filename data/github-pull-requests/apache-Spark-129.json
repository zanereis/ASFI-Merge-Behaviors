What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-39638 and SPARK-39231, `ColumnVectorUtils#populate(WritableColumnVector, InternalRow, int)` method in `ColumnVectorUtils` only used by  `ConstantColumnVectorBenchmark` and `ColumnVectorSuite`.  So this pr do following changes:\r\n\r\n- Clean up `ColumnVectorUtils#populate(WritableColumnVector, InternalRow, int)` from `ColumnVectorUtils`\r\n- Added a simplified version `populate` method for `ConstantColumnVectorBenchmark`\r\n- Clean up `SPARK-38018: ColumnVectorUtils.populate to handle CalendarIntervalType correctly` from `ColumnVectorSuite` due this scenario no longer exists, and the similar scenarios using `ConstantColumnVector` have been covered by `fill calendar interval` in `ColumnVectorUtils`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up useless code\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Execute `ConstantColumnVectorBenchmark` manually with [Benchmark GitHub Action](https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/runs/7147111541), the result file can be produced successfully. Since the result has no obvious change, so not update in the current pr\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-01T09:10:12Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T02:07:39Z","closed_at":"2022-07-04T16:56:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb97ceeebc2737cc70c200cc21491abb10121a60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37045/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37045/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37045/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e4dfd8036959da1fabbacbd7a865bd76ffc8a1b","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-39653","ref":"SPARK-39653","sha":"3e4dfd8036959da1fabbacbd7a865bd76ffc8a1b","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of #36963.\r\n\r\nWith the change of #36963, LogicalRelation prints out the catalog table differently in explain on logical plan. It only prints out the qualified table name, and optionally also prints the class of serde if the information is available.\r\n\r\n#36963 does not account the part which can be optionally written (serde class). While this does not break \"current\" tests, it would be ideal to address the issue in prior.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new internal config to exclude serde on output of CatalogTable in SQL explain, which is intended to use only for test e.g. SQLQueryTestSuite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt could probably be a possible bug in future, though it would be just a test side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs. The internal test failed because of this (it exposed the serde class), and we fixed the test with this patch.","created_at":"2022-07-01T06:44:39Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T20:37:19Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T08:47:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5126c9f830056127fef235e1b4d7a03bed1bc727","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14466d47db1f47bff3206522159ab084eac32f9a","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-39564-followup","ref":"SPARK-39564-followup","sha":"14466d47db1f47bff3206522159ab084eac32f9a","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the incorrect value schema in streaming deduplication. It stores the empty row having a single column with null (using NullType), but the value schema is specified as all columns, which leads incorrect behavior from state store schema compatibility checker.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set the schema of value as `StructType(Array(StructField(\"__dummy__\", NullType)))` to fit with the empty row. With this change, the streaming queries creating the checkpoint after this fix would work smoothly.\r\n\r\nTo not break the existing streaming queries having incorrect value schema, this PR proposes to disable the check for value schema on streaming deduplication. Disabling the value check was there for the format validation (we have two different checkers for state store), but it has been missing for state store schema compatibility check. To avoid adding more config, this PR leverages the existing config \"format validation\" is using.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix. Suppose the streaming query below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# df has the columns `a`, `b`, `c`\r\nval df = spark.readStream.format(\"...\").load()\r\nval query = df.dropDuplicate(\"a\").writeStream.format(\"...\").start()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the query is running, df can produce a different set of columns (e.g. `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) from the same source due to schema evolution. Since we only deduplicate the rows with column `a`, the change of schema should not matter for streaming deduplication, but state store schema checker throws error saying \"value schema is not compatible\" before this fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is basically a bug fix which end users wouldn't notice unless they encountered a bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2022-07-01T04:41:30Z","updated_at":"2022-07-03T23:21:58Z","closed_at":"2022-07-02T13:46:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3743543b0261061674086f045fb441b09503ce2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix type hints of `like`, `rlike`, `ilike` of Column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent type hints are incorrect so the doc is confusing: `Union[\"Column\", \"LiteralType\", \"DecimalLiteral\", \"DateTimeLiteral\"]]` is hinted whereas only `str` is accepted.\r\n\r\nThe PR is proposed to adjust the above issue by introducing `_bin_op_other_str`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Doc change only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug in the original SPARK-37205 PR, where we treat the method `setTokensConf` as a static method, but it should be non-static instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe method `setTokensConf` is non-static so the current code will fail:\r\n```\r\n06/29/2022 - 17:28:16  - Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: object is not an instance of declaring class\r\n06/29/2022 - 17:28:16  - at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n06/29/2022 - 17:28:16  - at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n06/29/2022 - 17:28:16  - at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n06/29/2022 - 17:28:16  - at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually tested this change internally and it now

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes three longstanding bugs in Spark's `JsonProtocol`:\r\n\r\n- `TaskResourceRequest` loses precision for `amount` < 0.5. The `amount` is a floating point number which is either between 0 and 0.5 or is a positive integer, but the JSON read path assumes it is an integer.\r\n- `ExecutorResourceRequest` integer overflows for values larger than Int.MaxValue because the write path writes longs but the read path assumes integers.\r\n- Off heap StorageLevels are not handled properly: the `useOffHeap` field isn't included in the JSON, so this StorageLevel cannot be round-tripped through JSON. This could cause the History Server to display inaccurate \"off heap memory used\" stats on the executors page.\r\n\r\nI discovered these bugs while working on #36885.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nJsonProtocol should be able to roundtrip events through JSON without loss of information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes: it fixes bugs that impact information shown in the History Server Web UI. The new StorageLevel JSON field will be visible to tools which process raw event log JSON.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing unit tests to cover the changed logic.","created_at":"2022-06-30T00:45:34Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T20:42:13Z","closed_at":"2022-06-30T20:42:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4471c473a7c0ecc216adb1b5e90b23f0a4ce0486","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/26ad09032bf52c8fae5ce40ed96b09616bcda30b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:jsonprotocol-bugfixes","ref":"jsonprotocol-bugfixes","sha":"26ad09032bf52c8fae5ce40ed96b09616bcda30b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add a `shuffleStatus != null` condition to `o.a.s.MapOutputTrackerMaster#unregisterShuffle` method to avoid throwing NPE when using Scala 2.13. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure that no NPE is thrown when `o.a.s.MapOutputTrackerMaster#unregisterShuffle` is called by multiple threads, this pr is only for Scala 2.13. \r\n\r\n`o.a.s.MapOutputTrackerMaster#unregisterShuffle` method will be called concurrently by the following two paths:\r\n\r\n- BlockManagerStorageEndpoint:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6f1046afa40096f477b29beecca5ca6286dfa7f3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManagerStorageEndpoint.scala#L56-L62\r\n\r\n-

2.13, for example `sql/core` module,  there are many log as follows，although these did not cause UTs failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n17:44:09.957 WARN org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerMaster: Failed to

PR is only for protection, we should remove this protection after Scala 2.13(maybe https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9957) fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GA\r\n- Add new test `SPARK-39553: Multi-thread unregister shuffle shouldn't throw NPE` to `MapOutputTrackerSuite`, we can test manually as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests -pl core -am -Pscala-2.13\r\nmvn clean test -pl core -Pscala-2.13 -Dtest=none

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TPCDSQueryBenchmark` cannot start via Github Actions. That is due to the extra required `--data-location` argument.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to provide an option to pass the argument by `SPARK_TPCDS_DATA` environment variable. This is the same approach taken by `TPCDSQueryTestSuite`. This PR also adds the Github workflow step to generate the TPC-DS data and set the `SPARK_TPCDS_DATA` location.\r\nDevelopers still can use `--data-location` argument to `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` just like before for manual testing.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a refinement of [the earlier attempt](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33544)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` is excluded from benchmark runs via Github Actions. Therefore, benchmark results e.g. TPCDSQueryBenchmark-results.txt are not updated regularly and obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested on  Github Actions.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-28T16:53:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T01:03:20Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T19:45:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ef4474553ca3a75acba0244e8c5119d6df5f6c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c79efce5fa100d4d917449109c169fbed0099b64","head":{"label":"kazuyukitanimura:SPARK-34927","ref":"SPARK-34927","sha":"c79efce5fa100d4d917449109c169fbed0099b64","user":{"login":"kazuyukitanimura","id":129050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura","html_url":"https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":394523815,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ1MjM4MTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"kazuyukitanimura/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kazuyukitanimura","id":129050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura","html_url":"https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazuyukitanimura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHello, according to this [problem](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39617 ) raised also by me, and highlighted by two other persons on Stack Overflow ([this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71691292/driver-cores-must-be-a-positive-number) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72473151/exception-in-thread-main-org-apache-spark-sparkexception-driver-cores-must-be)) and thanks to this [feature](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35013) we are currently unable to run Spark 3.2.x with Mesos in Cluster Mode.\r\n\r\nFrom what I saw, it happends because of the **_MesosClusterDispatcher_** and its components which treat the driverCores variable as a Double and in the end it's passed to SparkSubmit as a double and this makes the check by **_SparkSubmitArguments_** to fail.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing this quick fix because I think it's a quick & safe way to go with.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be able to run Spark 3.2.x in Cluster Mode with Mesos\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt's a very small change, basically the Cast from String to Int is safe now.\r\n\r\nThank

[SPARK-27073](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27073), fix a race condition when handling of IdleStateEvent, but in [SPARK-37462](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37462) the call

encountered in our production environment, and it is difficult to test the race condition

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCoalesce paritition for every group\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWith CartesianProduct,  CoalesceShufflePartitions can not optimize it.\r\n\r\nSuch as sql like this, if CoalesceShufflePartitions can not apply ,`t1 join t2` will produce a lot partition, the result partition will be `left partition * right partition` which can be quite large.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM ( SELECT * FROM t3) t3\r\n    JOIN (\r\n        SELECT t1.key, t2.value FROM\r\n         ( SELECT * FROM t1) t1\r\n            JOIN\r\n         ( SELECT * FROM t2) t2\r\n            ON t1.value = t2.value\r\n    ) t ON t3.key = t.key OR t3.value = t.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's better to support partial optimize with CartesianProductExec.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new API `Dataset.as(StructType)` to \"cast\" the entire dataframe to the specified schema. Its behavior is very similar to table insertion where we need to adjust the input query to match the table schema, but it's extended to work for inner fields as well:\r\n* Reorder columns and/or inner fields to match the specified schema\r\n* Project away columns and/or inner fields that are not needed by the specified schema\r\n* Cast the columns and/or inner fields to match the data types in the specified schema\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor lakehouse tables, schema evolution is a common feature. It's more robust to specify the expected schema at the beginning so that the data pipeline can always be run with the same input schema.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it adds a new API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdated REST API `/api/v1/applications`, to use the same condition as history server page to filter completed/incomplete applications.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen opening summary page, history server follows this logic:\r\n\r\n- If there's completed/incomplete application, page will add script in response, using AJAX to call the REST API to get the filtered list.\r\n- If there's no such application, page will only return a message telling nothing found.\r\n\r\nIssue is that page and REST API are using different conditions to filter applications. In `HistoryPage`, an application is considered as completed as long as the last attempt is completed. But in `ApplicationListResource`, all attempts should be completed. This brings inconsistency and will cause issue in a corner case.\r\n\r\nIn driver, event queues have capacity to protect memory. When there's too many events, some of them will be dropped and the event log file will be incomplete. For an application with multiple attempts, there's possibility that the last attempt is completed, but the previous attempts is considered as incomplete due to loss of application end event.\r\n\r\nFor this type of application, page thinks it is completed, but the API thinks it is still running. When opening summary page:\r\n- When checking completed applications, page will call script, but API returns nothing.\r\n- When checking incomplete applications, page returns nothing.\r\n\r\nSo the user won't be able to see this app in history server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, there will be a change on `/api/v1/applications` API and history server summary page.\r\n\r\nWhen calling API, for application mentioned above, previously it is considered as running. After the change it is considered as completed. So the result will be different using same filter. But this change should be OK. Because attempts are executed sequentially and incrementally. So if an attempt with bigger ID is completed, the previous attempts can be considered as completed.\r\n\r\nFor history server summary page, previously user is not able to see the application. Now it will appear in the completed applications.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a new unit test `HistoryServerPageSuite`, which will check whether `HistoryPage` behaves the same as `ApplicationListResource` when filtering applications. To implement the test, there's a minor change of `HistoryPage`, exposing a method called `shouldDisplayApplications` to tell whether the summary page will display applications.\r\n\r\nThe test verifies that:\r\n- If no completed/incomplete application found, `HistoryPage` should not display applications, and API should return an empty list.\r\n- Otherwise, `HistoryPage` should display applications, and API should return a non-empty list.\r\n\r\nCurrently 2 scenarios are included:\r\n- Application with last attempt completed but previous attempt incomplete.\r\n- Application with last attempt incomplete but previous attempt completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-27T15:58:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-06T16:17:38Z","closed_at":"2022-07-08T13:20:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a84a3f5c81cad8a86e22d2b3968c79d11218c60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb8242fb5aa7764aa052df18125e2ed4fb6d51ac","head":{"label":"kuwii:kuwii/hs-fix","ref":"kuwii/hs-fix","sha":"eb8242fb5aa7764aa052df18125e2ed4fb6d51ac","user":{"login":"kuwii","id":10705175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzA1MTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10705175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii","html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":507788564,"node_id":"R_kgDOHkQ9FA","name":"spark","full_name":"kuwii/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kuwii","id":10705175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzA1MTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10705175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii","html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdated REST API `/api/v1/applications`, to use the same condition as history server page to filter completed/incomplete applications.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen opening summary page, history server follows this logic:\r\n\r\nIf there's completed/incomplete application, page will add script in response, using AJAX to call the REST API to get the filtered list.\r\n- If there's no such application, page will only return a message telling nothing found.\r\n- Issue is that page and REST API are using different conditions to filter applications. In `HistoryPage`, an application is considered as completed as long as the last attempt is completed. But in `ApplicationListResource`, all attempts should be completed. This brings inconsistency and will cause issue in a corner case.\r\n\r\nIn driver, event queues have capacity to protect memory. When there's too many events, some of them will be dropped and the event log file will be incomplete. For an application with multiple attempts, there's possibility that the last attempt is completed, but the previous attempts is considered as incomplete due to loss of application end event.\r\n\r\nFor this type of application, page thinks it is completed, but the API thinks it is still running. When opening summary page:\r\n- When checking completed applications, page will call script, but API returns nothing.\r\n- When checking incomplete applications, page returns nothing.\r\n\r\nSo the user won't be able to see this app in history server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, there will be a change on `/api/v1/applications` API.\r\n\r\nFor application mentioned above, previously it is considered as running. After the change it is considered as completed. So the result will be different using same filter.\r\n\r\nBut I think this change should be OK. Because attempts are executed sequentially and incrementally. So if an attempt with bigger ID is completed, the previous attempts should also be completed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWIP\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-27T15:20:35Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T15:56:50Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T15:56:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"029e3311e2c41bfc47071bacd2659c9ff7a1298d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d87d84ca8233462dc13e58b13c51930cc26cbe5c","head":{"label":"kuwii:kuwii/hs-fix","ref":"kuwii/hs-fix","sha":"d87d84ca8233462dc13e58b13c51930cc26cbe5c","user":{"login":"kuwii","id":10705175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzA1MTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10705175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii","html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":507788564,"node_id":"R_kgDOHkQ9FA","name":"spark","full_name":"kuwii/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kuwii","id":10705175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzA1MTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10705175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii","html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new expression `RegExpCount` as a runtime replaceable expression of `Size` and `RegExpExtractAll`. And bind the expression to the function name `REGEXP_COUNT`. The `REGEXP_COUNT` function returns a count of the number of times that a regular expression pattern is matched in a string. It takes two parameters:\r\n1. An expression that specifies the string in which the search is to take place.\r\n2. An expression that specifies the regular expression string that is the pattern for the search.\r\n\r\nWhen any of the input parameters are NULL, the function returns NULL too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier, and achieve feature parity to such systems. For example, Redshift and Snowflake support the `REGEXP_COUNT` function, see:\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/REGEXP_COUNT.html\r\n- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/regexp_count.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z regexp-functions.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *ExpressionsSchemaSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix a regression at Apache Spark 3.3.0 which doesn't allow long pod name prefix whose length is greater than 63.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Pod's `hostname` follows [DNS Label Names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names), Pod name itself follows [DNS Subdomain Names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names) whose maximum length is 253.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd new feature, make distribution and ordering support V2 function in writing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the rule `V2Writes` support converting `ApplyTransform` to `TransformExpression` (unevaluable), this PR makes `V2Writes` supports converting `TransformExpression` to `ApplyFunctionExpression`/`Invoke`/`StaticInvoke` (evaluable).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-33779 introduced API for DSv2 writer to claim distributions and orderings of data before writing, w/ SPARK-34026, Spark can translate `IdentityTransform` to catalyst expression in distributions and orderings expressions.\r\n\r\nBut for some databases like ClickHouse, which allows table partition defined by an expression, e.g. `PARTITIONED BY num % 10` it's useful to support translating `ApplyTransform` so Spark can organize the data to fit the target storage requirement before writing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, user can use V2 function as partition transform in DSv2 connector.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support more cases for pushing down limit through window.\r\n1. Window's partition specification is not empty. It will push down top N with global sort by partition specification and order specification.\r\n   ```sql\r\n   -- Origin query\r\n   SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b) AS rn FROM Tab1 LIMIT 5;\r\n   -- Equivalent push down limit query\r\n   SELECT *,\r\n          row_number() OVER(partition BY a ORDER BY b) AS rn\r\n   FROM   (SELECT * FROM tab1 ORDER BY a, b LIMIT 5) t\r\n   ```\r\n2. It has `less than` or `less than or equal` filter condition on that pushable window and limit number less than or equal with that filter condition.\r\n   ```sql\r\n   -- Origin query\r\n   SELECT *\r\n   FROM   (SELECT *, row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b) AS rn FROM tab1) t\r\n   WHERE  rn <= 5\r\n   LIMIT 5\r\n   -- Equivalent push down limit query\r\n   SELECT *\r\n   FROM   (SELECT *,\r\n                  row_number() OVER(partition BY a ORDER BY b) AS rn\r\n           FROM   (SELECT * FROM tab1 ORDER BY a, b LIMIT 5) t)\r\n   WHERE rn <= 5\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.\r\n\r\nImpala also support it: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-9983\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve logs to show address together in addition to ports.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide used address information explicitly . \r\n\r\n1. For example, we can check if `IPv4` and `IPv6` is used correctly.\r\n\r\n**IPv4**\r\n```\r\nStandaloneRestServer: Started REST server for submitting applications on 172.16.0.31 with port 54511\r\n```\r\n\r\n**IPv6**\r\n```\r\nStandaloneRestServer: Started REST server for submitting applications on [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1] with port 54566\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In `NettyBlockTrasferService`, `hostName` could be different from `bindAddress` like the following.\r\n```\r\nNettyBlockTransferService: Server created on otherHost localhost:54718\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the docs for `array_agg`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe \"Since\" marker is incorrect, leading to user confusion when they think they should be able to use `array_agg` on their version of Spark but don't find it available.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the docs for `array_agg`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI didn't test it, since it's so small as to be presumptively correct.

wishes.)","created_at":"2022-06-24T19:54:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T14:40:39Z","closed_at":"2022-06-25T11:42:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7758ebcdc757773446870e32b38cdc3c3288c44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13cb59fcc3ca41b50c49c3c54c808ad5732160c0","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-39582-array-agg-since","ref":"SPARK-39582-array-agg-since","sha":"13cb59fcc3ca41b50c49c3c54c808ad5732160c0","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd ByteBuffer#rewind after ByteBuffer#get in AvroDeserializer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- HeapBuffer.get(bytes) puts the data from POS to the end into bytes, and sets POS as the end. The next call will return empty bytes. \r\n- The second call of AvroDeserializer will return an InternalRow with empty binary column when avro record has binary column. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd ut in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange `getDatabase` and `listDatabases` catalog API to support 3 layer namespace. If the database exists in the sessionCatalog, we return that. Otherwise, parse the name as 3 layer name and use V2 catalog. Furthermore, `Database` class is augmented with `catalog` (a nullable String). The original constructor is retained for backwards compatibilty.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`getDatabase`/`listDatabases` don't support 3 layer namespace.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This PR introduces a backwards-compatible API change to support 3 layer namespace (e.g. `catalog.database.table`). Additionally, the `Database` type includes a new field `catalog`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-06-23T19:39:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-01T02:52:50Z","closed_at":"2022-07-01T01:42:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4617c6c2a7a7e703ef89bb5f162d85c0f8d87596","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/879b9a6f423dc03d0475aec6821fc56b4cae8992","head":{"label":"zachschuermann:3l-catalog","ref":"3l-catalog","sha":"879b9a6f423dc03d0475aec6821fc56b4cae8992","user":{"login":"zachschuermann","id":19472747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDcyNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19472747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann","html_url":"https://github.com/zachschuermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506424940,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi9ubA","name":"spark","full_name":"zachschuermann/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zachschuermann","id":19472747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDcyNzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19472747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann","html_url":"https://github.com/zachschuermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachschuermann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zachschuermann/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`ResolveInlineTables` requires the column expressions to be foldable, however, `Alias` is not foldable. Inline-table does not use the names in the column expressions, and we should trim aliases before checking foldable. We did something similar in `ResolvePivot`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make inline-table handle more cases, and also fixed a regression caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31844 . After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31844 , we always add an alias for function literals like `current_timestamp`, which breaks inline table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyea, some failed queries can be run after this PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the `PercentileBase` to support ANSI interval types (year-month and day-time interval types) by the `Percentile`, `PercentileDisc`, `Median`, `PercentileCont` expressions. Intermediately, input intervals are casted to double values, and eventually the result of the calculations are casted back to intervals.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Before the changes, the `percentile` functions fail with error:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW intervals AS SELECT * FROM VALUES\r\n         > (0, INTERVAL '0' SECOND),\r\n         > (0, INTERVAL '20' SECOND),\r\n         > (0, INTERVAL '25' SECOND),\r\n         > (0, INTERVAL '30' SECOND)\r\n         > AS intervals(k, dt);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT median(dt), percentile(dt, 0.25), percentile_cont(0.75)\r\n         > WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dt) FROM intervals;\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'median(intervals.dt)' due to data type mismatch: argument 1 requires numeric type, however, 'intervals.dt' is of interval second type.; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT median(dt), percentile(dt, 0.25), percentile_cont(0.75)\r\n         > WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dt) FROM intervals;\r\n0 00:00:22.500000000\t0

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to expose the information of catalog table (V1/V2) to the logical plan in streaming query, specifically, parsed plan and analyzed plan. (We may discard some information in optimized plan.)\r\n\r\nThe major change is to propagate the information of catalog table from the place we resolve the table to the place we execute the query. In MicroBatch execution, we have several transformations on the logical plan which replace the node with another node, hence this PR touches multiple logical nodes which the code path passes through.\r\n\r\nSpecifically for DSv1 sink, we don't have a specific write logical node, hence it's not feasible to expose the information for the destination. This PR introduces `WriteToMicroBatchDataSourceV1` which is DSv1 version of `WriteToMicroBatchDataSource` as a logical node for DSv1 sink. Worth noting that `WriteToMicroBatchDataSourceV1` plays as a marker - we eliminate this node in streaming specific optimization phase.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR give a better UX to end users who use table API for streaming query. Previously it's not easy or even not feasible to check which tables are being read and written from the streaming query. Most likely it requires end users to look into their code/query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, in parsed/analyzed plan, we now expose the table information into the read/write logical node. Specifically for DSv1, we introduce a marker write node to expose the information for destination without majorly changing existing logic.\r\n\r\n> DSv1 read and write\r\n\r\n>> Before the patch\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1635\" alt=\"original-read-from-dsv1-write-to-dsv1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/175210731-dcc4cc4d-a70b-467d-b577-79c20600db32.png\">\r\n\r\n>> After the patch\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1716\" alt=\"proposal-read-from-dsv1-write-to-dsv1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/175262327-960a23f5-6b24-4b89-bdaf-766a5c31aaf1.png\">\r\n\r\n> DSv2 read and write\r\n\r\n>> Before the patch\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1684\" alt=\"original-read-from-dsv2-write-to-dsv2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/175210780-4a99c670-8a42-4511-959c-cafe0c24bc00.png\">\r\n\r\n>> After the patch\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1755\" alt=\"proposal-read-from-dsv2-write-to-dsv2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/175261938-fd7804a6-b98e-4202-ae23-622b512c66fa.png\">\r\n\r\nWorth noting that the screenshot is taken with the config \"spark.sql.ui.explainMode=extended\". By default, we only show physical plan as formatted one, which hides the improvement being done here. Still, end users can run `query.explain(extended=true)` to print out plan\"s\" which contains parsed/analyzed plans.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test cases.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport ARRAY, STRUCT, MAP types as DEFAULT values.\r\n\r\nPreviously these types were not supported and DDL commands that attempted to use them

DEFAULT ARRAY(1, 2);\r\nSELECT * FROM t;\r\n> false, [1, 2]\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE t(I BOOLEAN) USING PARQUET;\r\nINSERT INTO t SELECT FALSE;\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN s STRUCT<x BOOLEAN, y STRING>

ListTables API compatible )\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nto support 3-layer-namespace in the python side\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1, for existing UT, update them to cover original cases;\r\n\r\n2, for 3-layer-namespace, maually test:\r\n  - 2.1 move all `InMemoryCatalog` related files from `test` to `main`, by `mv sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/InMemory*.scala sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/`\r\n - 2.2 fix a few conflicts\r\n - 2.3 compile and then maually test in the pyspark repl, for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE DATABASE my_db\")\r\nspark.createDataFrame([(1, 1)]).createOrReplaceTempView(\"temp_tab\")\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE tab1 (name STRING, age INT)

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a check for invalid plans in AQE replanning process. The check will throw exceptions when it detects an invalid plan, causing AQE to void the current replanning result and keep using the latest valid plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAQE logical optimization rules can lead to invalid physical plans and cause runtime exceptions as certain physical plan nodes are not compatible with others. E.g., `BroadcastExchangeExec` can only work as a direct child of broadcast join nodes, but it could appear under other incompatible physical plan nodes because of empty relation propagation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `LimitPushDownThroughWindow` so that it no longer supports pushing down a limit through a window using percent_rank.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nGiven a query with a limit of _n_ rows, and a window whose child produces _m_ rows, percent_rank will label the _nth_ row as 100% rather than the _mth_ row.\r\n\r\nThis behavior conflicts with Spark 3.1.3, Hive 2.3.9 and Prestodb 0.268.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\nAssume this data:\r\n```\r\ncreate table t1 stored as parquet as\r\nselect *\r\nfrom range(101);\r\n```\r\nAnd also assume this query:\r\n```\r\nselect id, percent_rank() over (order by id) as pr\r\nfrom t1\r\nlimit 3;\r\n```\r\nWith Spark 3.2.1, 3.3.0, and master, the limit is applied before the percent_rank:\r\n```\r\n0\t0.0\r\n1\t0.5\r\n2\t1.0\r\n```\r\nWith Spark 3.1.3, and Hive 2.3.9, and Prestodb 0.268, the limit is applied _after_ percent_rank:\r\n\r\nSpark 3.1.3:\r\n```\r\n0\t0.0\r\n1\t0.01\r\n2\t0.02\r\n```\r\nHive 2.3.9:\r\n```\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select id, percent_rank() over (order by id) as pr\r\nfrom t1\r\nlimit 3;\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> WARNING: Hive-on-MR is deprecated in Hive 2 and may not be available in the future versions. Consider using a different execution engine (i.e. spark, tez) or using Hive 1.X releases.\r\n+-----+-------+\r\n| id  |  pr   |\r\n+-----+-------+\r\n| 0   | 0.0   |\r\n| 1   | 0.01  |\r\n| 2   | 0.02  |\r\n+-----+-------+\r\n3 rows selected (4.621 seconds)\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrestodb 0.268:\r\n```\r\n id |  pr  \r\n----+------\r\n  0 |  0.0 \r\n  1 | 0.01 \r\n  2 | 0.02 \r\n(3 rows)\r\n```\r\nWith this PR, Spark will apply the limit after percent_rank.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo (besides changing percent_rank's behavior to be more like Spark 3.1.3, Hive, and Prestodb).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of #36903\r\n\r\nChange `Inline.eval` to return a row of null values rather than a null row in the case of a null input struct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider the following query:\r\n```\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nselect inline(array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2), null));\r\n```\r\nThis query fails with a `NullPointerException`:\r\n```\r\n22/06/16 15:10:06 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.GenerateExec.$anonfun$doExecute$11(GenerateExec.scala:122)\r\n```\r\n(In Spark 3.1.x, you don't need to set `spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage` to false to reproduce the error, since Spark 3.1.x has no codegen path for `Inline`).\r\n\r\nThis query fails regardless of the setting of `spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage`:\r\n```\r\nval dfWide = (Seq((1))\r\n  .toDF(\"col0\")\r\n  .selectExpr(Seq.tabulate(99)(x => s\"$x as col${x + 1}\"): _*))\r\n\r\nval df = (dfWide\r\n  .selectExpr(\"*\", \"array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2), null) as struct_array\"))\r\n\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"*\", \"inline(struct_array)\").collect\r\n```\r\nIt fails with\r\n```\r\n22/06/16 15:18:55 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)/ 1]\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.JoinedRow.isNullAt(JoinedRow.scala:80)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.writeFields_0_8$(Unknown Source)\r\n```\r\nWhen `Inline.eval` returns a null row in the collection, GenerateExec gets a NullPointerException either when joining the null row with required child output, or projecting the null row.\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids producing the null row and produces a row of null values instead:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nspark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\tfalse\r\nTime taken: 3.095 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> select inline(array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2), null));\r\n1\t2\r\nNULL\tNULL\r\nTime taken: 1.214 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\nspark-sql>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.","created_at":"2022-06-21T20:58:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:09:26Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T23:32:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28db02931028bdde48dc90b9634201865adf4bf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0fb5a5f638125dd4e4e8a6a9ef2a0a8cb42008fc","head":{"label":"bersprockets:inline_eval_null_struct_issue_31","ref":"inline_eval_null_struct_issue_31","sha":"0fb5a5f638125dd4e4e8a6a9ef2a0a8cb42008fc","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change attempts to make V2SessionCatalog return NoSuchNameSpaceException rather than NoSuchDataseException\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nif a catalog doesn't overrides `namespaceExists` it by default uses `loadNamespaceMetadata` and in case a `db` not exists loadNamespaceMetadata throws a `NoSuchDatabaseException` which is not catched and we see failures even with `if exists` clause. One such use case we observed was in iceberg table a post test clean up was failing with `NoSuchDatabaseException` now. Also queries such as `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {}` fails with no such db exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nModified the UT to match the proposed
