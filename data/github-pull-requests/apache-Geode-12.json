redis commands that increment or decrement using a long end up storing the new value in the RedisData instance as an ascii byte array. They are also required to return that value to the client. When geode's implementation returns the value, it currently does so as a \"long\" instead of as a \"byte[]\". This forces the code later on to call Coder.longToBytes again. Since we already have it in the correct form we should return that to the caller so that it can just copy the bytes instead of needing to compute them again.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

incorrectly\nassumes thatif a file path does not start with a file separator, it must\nbe relative. It attempts to convert such a path to absolute by\nprepending the current directory onto it:\n\n```\nString absoluteDiskDirectoryName = diskDirectoryName.startsWith(File.separator)\n        ? diskDirectoryName\n        : CURRENT_DIRECTORY + File.separator + diskDirectoryName;\n```\n\nOn Windows, an absolute file path can begin with a letter, e.g.\n`C:\\Users\\geode\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\junit783716437098694709\\DISKSTORE`.\nThe test incorrectly interprets a path like this as relative, and\nprepends the current directory onto it, producing an invalid path. It\nthen uses this incorrect path in an assertion, causing the test to fail\nwhen it should pass.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nUse Java's `Path` implementation for the OS to compute the absolute form of the given

is now used by RedisHash and RedisSortedSet for its map.\r\nThis saves around 20 bytes per \"hash\" or \"zset\" instance.\r\nBytes2ObjectOpenHashMap is derived from Object2ObjectOpenCustomHashMap so if you see\r\nsome code in it that you question, compare it to the original. The class comment on Bytes2ObjectOpenHashMap describes the changes made to it. The goal was to keep the code as\r\nclose to the original, but to make some changes to save on memory. Some cosmetic changes were\r\nalso made using intellij automated cleanup (for example adding curly braces, getting rid of extra parens).\r\n\r\nSome new top level methods were added to allow users to avoid the overhead of creating a new instance\r\nwhen calling keySet(), entrySet(), or values(). These methods use to cache their result but no longer do to save on memory footprint. These new methods are named \"fast*\" and use the same pattern of some fast iteration code from the original Object2ObjectOpenCustomHashMap.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

convertLongToAsciiDigits to Coder so that ints and longs can more efficiently be converted to bytes. The goal was to reduce\r\nthe number of short lived object allocations based on this observation:\r\n  Refactor the getIntegerResponse(ByteBuf buffer, long l) method to write byte string representation to avoid allocating transient char[], String, and byte[]. The existing allocations accounted for 17% of objects requiring GC.\r\n\r\nSo now when converting an int or long we never convert it to a String and for some values (-99..99) we don't allocate a new byte array. The same is also true when converting a sequence of bytes from command input into a long; we no longer allocate a short lived String.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

limits command lines to a maximum length of ~32k characters. The\ncommand line for DUnit child VMs is very close to this limit.\n\nCurrently this prevents us from adding JUnit 5 support. JUnit 5 adds 8\nmore jars to the classpath, which adds ~1300 characters to the command\nline, which puts the command line over the limit.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nWrite the ChildVM's entire classpath to a \"pathing\" jar, then include\nonly that pathing jar on the command line. This results in command line\nthat is shorter by many thousands of characters, and which does not grow\nas we add more jars or other classpath elements.\n","created_at":"2021-08-16T21:39:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T21:00:23Z","closed_at":"2021-08-19T21:00:20Z","merged_at":"2021-08-19T21:00:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e9b3684f2be3f2ff8174c690bd2c15d31f9179c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2387116680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg3MTE2Njgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"4d86eb","default":false,"description":"add

`RestAPICompatibilityTest` backward compatibility test assumed that\ntwo ephemeral ports would remain available while not in use. The test:\n\n1. Launched two locators, each on an ephemeral port.\n2. Stopped each locator.\n3.

Starts a server on an ephemeral port\n2. Stops the server\n3. Restarts the server on the same port\n\nThis test failed in CI because, between steps 2 and 3, another process\nbound to the ephemeral port.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange `CqPerfDUnitTest.createServer(VM)` to assign an available port via\n`AvailablePortHelper`, rather than specify an ephemeral port. The ports\nassigned by `AvailablePortHelper` are outside of each OS's ephemeral\nport range.\n\nCONSIDERED\n\nI could have changed just the one failing test to assign a port. But\nbecause there is no good reason for tests to prefer ephemeral ports by\ndefault, I decided to change the `createServer(VM)` to always assign a\nport. This change preempts this kind of problem in other tests. If a\ntest has an explicit need for an ephemeral port, it can call\n`createServer(VM, 0)` to get

JUnit 5 support to all Geode projects that use `geode-junit`.\n\nSTANDARD TEST TASKS\n\nUpdated **./gradle/test.gradle** to configure these standard test tasks\nto use JUnit Platform to run tests:\n- `test` and `repeatUnitTest`\n- `acceptanceTest` and `repeatAcceptanceTest`\n- `distributedTest` and `repeatDistributedTest`\n- `integrationTest` and `repeatIntegrationTest`\n- `performanceTest`\n- `uiTest`\n- `upgradeTest` and `repeatUpgradeTest`\n\nSTANDARD TEST MODULES\n\nUpdated **./geode-junit/build.gradle**:\n- Added `junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-params` as API\n  dependencies.\n- Added `junit-jupiter-engine` and `junit-vintage-engine` as\n  implementation dependencies.\n\nThese changes add JUnit 5 support to any source set that depends on\n`geode-junit`, either directly or via `geode-dunit`.\n\nOTHER PROJECTS\n\nAdded `junit-vintage-engine` dependency directly to each project that\nruns tests without `geode-junit` or `geode-dunit`:\n- `geode-common`\n- `geode-concurrency-test`\n- `geode-jmh`\n- `geode-modules`\n- `geode-rebalancer`\n- `static-analysis:pmd-rules`\n\nThese changes **do not** add JUnit 5 support to these projects.\nDevelopers who want

- Previously when you only specified --dir option the PID was read from\r\n   the member workDir and the status request was attempted to solved by\r\n   using the attachment API, and after that JMX interface.\r\n   But given only --dir was specified the controller resolving the\r\n   request should be FileProcessController instead.\r\n - Logic has been changed for both servers and locators to always use\r\n   FileProcessConroller whenever only --dir flag is specified.\r\n - Added an UT to verify new code.\r\n - Modified several ITs to verify the new behaviour.\r\n - Deleted the following ITs which no longer apply with the new logic:\r\n   * statusWithEmptyPidFileThrowsIllegalArgumentException\r\n   * statusWithEmptyWorkingDirectoryReturnsNotRespondingWithDetails\r\n   *

of using a general purpose sizer for sizing the contents of the map and set, now these classes are abstract and the subclasses that know the type of the element have some simple code to size element.\r\nAlso the overhead constants are now computed at runtime using JvmSizeUtils.sizeClass which will give us accurate numbers when the sizing is done on different types of jvms. The big difference is when the jvm has a large heap or uses ZGC since both of these disable compressed oops. Some of the existing tests exist to compute these overhead constants; I got them passing but it might make sense to remove them or at least rename them.\r\n\r\nNote that RedisSortedSet no longer does extra sizing that it then undoes with the \"sizeInBytesAdjustment\". Instead it just has a score set that does not size the element at all since it is already sized by the MemberMap. \r\nAlso the computing the byte size of the score set is now simpler getting rid of another int field.\r\nRemoval of these fields reduced the memory overhead of RedisSortedSet.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

commit changes Geode's build system to run test worker processes\noutside of Docker. It replaces the Dockerized test plugin with a new\nplugin that assigns each test worker process a distinct range of ports.\n\nBUILD SYSTEM\n\nChanged `multi-process-test.gradle` to mark relevant test tasks as\nisolated tests. The `IsolatedTestPlugin` applies itself to test tasks\nmarked this way.\n\nDOCKERIZED TEST PLUGIN\n\nRemoved the dockerized test plugin.\n\nSPECIFY PORT RANGES VIA SYSTEM PROPERTIES\n\nAdded `AvailablePort.lowerBound` and `AvailablePort.upperBound` system\nproperties to specify the range of non-membership ports considered by\nthe \"get random port\" methods of `AvaiablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper`.\n\nChanged `AvailablePort` and `AvailablePortHelper` to use the membership\nport range specified by Geode's existing `membership-port-range` system\nproperty, if defined.\n\nChanged `ProcessManager`to forward the test worker JVM's port range\nsystem properties to each child VM it creates.\n\nISOLATED TEST PLUGIN\n\nAdded the `IsolatedTestPlugin`, which overrides Gradle's built-in test\nworker process launcher with a custom mechanism:\n\n- `PortRange`: Defines a range of ports.\n- `PortRangeContext`: Defines the membership and non-membership port\n  ranges for a process. Configures each `ProcessBuilder` to set the port\n  range system properties for the process being launched.\n- `CompletableProcess`: Wraps a regular Java `Process` to execute an\n  action on termination.\n- `PortRangeProcessLauncher`: Assigns each test worker process a\n  distinct port range context. Launches test worker processes. Wraps\n  each test worker `Process` in a `CompletableProcess` that releases its\n  port range context when the process terminates.\n\nSPECIFIC TESTS\n\nChanged several tests in `DistributedSystemDUnitTest` and\n`InternalDistributedSystemJUnitTest` to clear the port range system\nproperties added by the `IsolatedTestPlugin`. These tests verify that\nthe system applies Geode's default port ranges. For these tests to work,\nthose system properties must not be defined.\n\nDisabled a `NetstatDUnitTest` test that executes `lsof`.

fix for GEODE-9139 has changed the way hostnames are handled when SNI endpoint validation is enabled. Because of that, when upgrading from some older versions of Geode to a version that contains the fix for GEODE-9139, the SSL handshake may fail to complete. This happens in cases where the call of `MemberData.getHostName()` method on an older member returns an IP address. In the fix for GEODE-9139, `Connection.createIoFilter()` uses the `hostname` for endpoint identification, and if the certificate contains a symbolic name, endpoint identification will fail with \"java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names matching IP address\" error.\r\n\r\nThis change adds `fromDataPre_GEODE_1_15_0_0` method to `MemberIdentifierImpl` that converts the `hostname` of an older member to a hostname if it contains an IP address. This change also adds `toDataPre_GEODE_1_15_0_0` but it doesn't convert the hostname back to an IP address. We think there is no need to do that because the member is about to be upgraded and will have a hostname in `hostname` field anyway. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Geode tests create a lot of threads. When these tests run in\nparallel with many other tests (as they do in CI), the whole set of\nconcurrently running tests can overwhelm the Linux kernel's ability to\nassign PIDs to new threads. When this happens, test processes, Gradle\nprocesses, and other processes can become unable to create new threads.\n\nThe relevant system parameter is `kernel.pid_max`. In our CI images,\n`pid_max` is 98,304.\n\nThis commit raises CI images' `pid_max` to 983040 (10x the default\nvalue). A build can run 24 concurrent instances of even our most\nthread-heavy tests without exceeding this threshold.\n\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery

`NestedFunctionExecutionDistributedTest` to create fewer threads.\n\nThe test creates a number of threads that is a multiple of\n`MAX_FE_THREADS`. On a CI machine, the default value of `MAX_FE_THREADS`\ncan be very high, causing this test to create thousands of threads. This\ncan leave the system unable to create threads for other processes, which\nin turn can cause Gradle processes or other tests to fail or hang.\n\nThis test now sets `MAX_FE_THREADS` to a lower value (100), which\nsuffices for the purpose of the test, and results in greatly reduced\nconsumption of threads.\n\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery
