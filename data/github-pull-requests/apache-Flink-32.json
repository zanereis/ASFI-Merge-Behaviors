you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using CEP as a complex event processing engine, when the logic is frequently modified and the threshold is frequently adjusted, the entire program needs to be stopped, the code should be modified, the program should be repackaged, and then submitted to the cluster. Dynamic logic modification and external dynamic injection cannot be realized. Currently, Realized the dynamic injection of CEP logic, based on message-driven logic modification, you can manually inject specific messages into the source end to achieve fine-grained control of logic injection perception\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n```java\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using windows for calculations, when the logic is frequently modified and adjusted, the entire program needs to be stopped, the code is modified, the program is repackaged and then submitted to the cluster. It is impossible to achieve logic dynamic modification and external dynamic injection. The window information can be obtained from the data to trigger Redistribution of windows to achieve the effect of dynamic windows\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - *First two dynamic time window triggers are defined `DynamicEventTimeTrigger`、`DynamicProcessingTimeTrigger`*\r\n  - *Then defined the time adjustment extractor ``TimeAdjustExtractor``*\r\n  - *Finally implemented the window assign `DynamicSlidingEventTimeWindows` 、`DynamicSlidingProcessingTimeWindows`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n(example:)\r\n### pojo class\r\n```java\r\npublic class TestPojo {\r\n    public String word;\r\n    public Integer value;\r\n    public long timestamp;\r\n    public long winSize;\r\n    public long winSlide;\r\n    public TestPojo() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public TestPojo(String word,Integer value, long timestamp, long winSize, long winSlide) {\r\n        this.word = word;\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n        this.timestamp = timestamp;\r\n        this.winSize = winSize;\r\n        this.winSlide = winSlide;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public static TestPojo of(String word,Integer value, long timestamp, long winSize, long winSlide){\r\n        return new TestPojo(word,value,timestamp,winSize,winSlide);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Dynamic Windows Calculate\r\n```java\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n        StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\r\n        env.setParallelism(1);\r\n        env\r\n                .socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\r\n                .map(new MapFunction<String, TestPojo>() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public TestPojo map(String s) throws Exception {\r\n                        String[] split = s.split(\",\");\r\n                        return TestPojo.of(\r\n                                split[0],\r\n                                Integer.valueOf(split[1]),\r\n                                Long.parseLong(split[2]),\r\n                                Long.parseLong(split[2]),\r\n                                Long.parseLong(split[2])\r\n                        );\r\n                    }\r\n                })\r\n                .assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(\r\n                        WatermarkStrategy.<TestPojo>forMonotonousTimestamps()\r\n                                .withTimestampAssigner(new SerializableTimestampAssigner<TestPojo>() {\r\n                                    @Override\r\n                                    public long extractTimestamp(TestPojo testPojo, long l) {\r\n                                        return testPojo.timestamp;\r\n                                    }\r\n                                })\r\n\r\n                )\r\n                .keyBy(r -> r.word)\r\n                .window(DynamicSlidingEventTimeWindows.of(\r\n                        // Pass in the default time information, used when there is no data stream\r\n                        Time.seconds(5L), Time.seconds(1L),\r\n                        // Extract time information from data streams\r\n                        new TimeAdjustExtractor<TestPojo>() {\r\n                            @Override\r\n                            public long extract(TestPojo element) {\r\n                                return element.winSlide;\r\n                            }\r\n                        },\r\n                        new TimeAdjustExtractor<TestPojo>() {\r\n                            @Override\r\n                            public long extract(TestPojo element) {\r\n                                return element.winSlide;\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n\r\n                ))\r\n                .sum(\"value\")\r\n                .print();\r\n        env.execute();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids consuming twice when two planners have the same table source.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds a `map` to cache all transformations that are related to the resolved table.\r\n  - During translating the table source scan nodes, finds the source transformation from the previously translated ones first. If exists, reuse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that validates that only one source transformation is generated even if it is derived to multiple datastreams.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

Support periodic flush\r\n\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept exploit for  [FLIP-325: Support periodic flush to increase operator throughput in stream mode](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-325%3A+Support+periodic+flush+to+increase+operator+throughput+in+stream+mode).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Added a flush scheduler to `CheckpointCoordinator` that periodically triggers global flush operations on source operators.\r\n- Introduced internal methods to `StreamTask`  which perform flush operations upon receiving a `FlushEvent` from upstream operators and broadcast `FlushEvent` to down-stream operators.\r\n- Introduced a flush API to `StreamOperator` interface, enabling operators heavily relying on state backend operations to override.\r\n- Supported triggering local flush operations on operators.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- Added a new end-to-end example class `AllowedLatency` to stream examples illustrating the flush module's throughput optimization on the aggregation pipeline.\r\n- Implemented an aggregator that overrides the `flush` method and buffers inputs received between two flush operations in memory.\r\n\r\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| execution.allowed-latency | long | Maximum interval between two flush operations |\r\n| execution.checkpointing.interval | long | Interval between two checkpoints |\r\n| execution.checkpointing.interval | long | Interval between two checkpoints |\r\n| dateNum | long | Number of input data |\r\n| keyCount | long | Number of different keys |\r\n### Example usage\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/flink run examples/streaming/AllowedLatency.jar --execution.allowed-latency 2000 --execution.checkpointing.interval 3000 dataNum 10000000\r\n```\r\n## Benchmark\r\n### With RocksDB State Backend\r\n| Checkpoint Interval | Flush Interval | Key Count | Throughput | Data | RocksDB Visits |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| 30000ms | 1000ms | 5e5 | 1785  ops/ms | 5e7 | 5452297 |\r\n| 30000ms | disabled | 5e5 | 257  ops/ms | 5e7 | 5e7 |\r\n\r\nThe flush module achieves optimization on throughput by reducing frequency of accessing state backends.\r\n### With Heap State Backend\r\n| Checkpoint Interval | Flush Interval | Key Count | Throughput | Data | Memory Visits |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| 30000ms | 1000ms | 5e5 | 4661  ops/ms | 5e7 | 54500000 |\r\n| 30000ms | disabled | 5e5 | 2234  ops/ms | 5e7 | 5e7 |\r\n\r\nWhen flush is enabled, the operator buffers the input records until a flush event is triggered. At that point, it emits a single record for each distinct key, effectively reducing the number of emitted records. On the other hand, without the flush operation, the operator would emit one output record for each input record, potentially leading to a larger number of records being processed.\r\nDespite the higher memory access overhead, the aggregation with flush enabled proves more efficient due to its optimized handling of data emission by reducing the number of output records through key-based aggregation.\r\n\r\n### Number of Distinct Keys\r\n| Checkpoint Interval | Flush Interval | Elements with the Same Key | Throughput | Data | RocksDB Visits |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| 30000ms |disabled | 1 | 125  ops/ms | 1e7 | 1e7 |\r\n| 30000ms | 1000ms | 1 | 140  ops/ms | 1e7 | 1e7 |\r\n| 30000ms | 2000ms | 3 | 554  ops/ms | 1e7 | 3036410 |\r\n| 30000ms | 3000ms | 10 | 1363  ops/ms | 2e7 | 2286605 |\r\n| 30000ms | 5000ms | 60 | 5569  ops/ms | 5e8 | 8536946 |\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements are attained when working with a smaller number of distinct keys. This is primarily attributed to the decreased visits to the state backend.\r\n## Influence on Checkpoint Snapshot Duration(synchronous part)\r\n| Checkpoint Interval | Flush Interval | Key Count |Duration | \r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| 10000ms | disabled | 1e6 | 115  ms |\r\n| 10000ms | 1000ms | 1e6 | 35  ms / 140  ms |\r\n| 10000ms | 5000ms | 1e6 | 55  ms |\r\n| 10000ms | 30000ms | 1e6 | 10  ms / 45 ms |\r\n\r\nIn this example, an in-memory hash map serves as the input data buffer between flush operations. When a checkpoint is triggered, the records stored in the hash map are copied into an operator's ListState and then serialized during the synchronized part of the checkpointing process.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the synchronous part of snapshotting is affected by the flush interval and the checkpoint interval. If at least one flush operation occurs between two checkpoints, both the operator state (in heap memory) and the keyed states (in RocksDB backend) will be serialized.\r\n\r\nHowever, if no flush

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*At present, the AdaptiveBatchScheduler uses the `SimpleExecutionSlotAllocator` to assign slot to execution, but it currently lacks support for the capability of input locality, which may increase unnecessary data transmission overhead. In this issue, we aim to enable the `SimpleExecutionSlotAllocator` to support the input locality.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *add  `SyncPreferredLocationsRetriever` in `SimpleExecutionSlotAllocator` to compute for preferredLocations to `SlotProfile`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added test in `SimpleExecutionSlotAllocator.testPreferredLocationsOfSlotProfile()` that validates the `SlotProfile` holds the preferred locations.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-18T02:20:32Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T06:36:34Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T06:36:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4e1d7db041931ede5166ad9286f103684557185","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f97697f8d215642bea7d313018f9cdee4ff87b7e","head":{"label":"codenohup:local-shuffle","ref":"local-shuffle","sha":"f97697f8d215642bea7d313018f9cdee4ff87b7e","user":{"login":"codenohup","id":130116763,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8Fsmw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130116763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup","html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":638940839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJhV2pw","name":"flink","full_name":"codenohup/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codenohup","id":130116763,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8Fsmw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130116763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup","html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* The entry points for using the Scala API were deprecated in https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/21176.  This PR ensures that all `@Public`, `@PublicEvolving` and `@Experimental` APIs are also marked as `@Deprecated`.\r\n* This PR doesn't have any code changes outside of deprecating these classes. Classes that are *not* scheduled for removal might still need to be migrated.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* All classes that contain one of those methods are also marked as deprecated with a link to [FLIP-265](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-265+Deprecate+and+remove+Scala+API+support).\r\n* The `flink-table`  modules have not been deprecated except for those dealing with a user-facing scala API (`flink-table-api-scala` and `flink-table-api-scala-bridge`)\r\n* The hadoop connector Scala classes were also `@Deprecated`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **yes**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no** (but it does prepare for the next major release as described in FLIP-265)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-17T14:08:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:13:15Z","closed_at":"2023-08-03T01:45:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f418b3ba4804d38fb40b486c8b2ce5c9746da27","assignee":{"login":"reswqa","id":19502505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTAyNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19502505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa","html_url":"https://github.com/reswqa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"reswqa","id":19502505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTAyNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19502505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa","html_url":"https://github.com/reswqa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993677,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzNjc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Scala","name":"component=API/Scala","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d5877e0c74898214225a4f8ae2a13fb209aa329c","head":{"label":"RyanSkraba:rskraba/FLINK-32560-deprecate-scala","ref":"rskraba/FLINK-32560-deprecate-scala","sha":"d5877e0c74898214225a4f8ae2a13fb209aa329c","user":{"login":"RyanSkraba","id":7744819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDQ4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7744819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanSkraba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":400189343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDAxODkzNDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"RyanSkraba/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RyanSkraba","id":7744819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDQ4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7744819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanSkraba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":f

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-17T09:13:29Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T04:05:52Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T04:05:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96af05168e1288b3dc076902f321366c571c4d6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ac24684138acd98ebd91297cf019a4792ca68b7b","head":{"label":"WencongLiu:dev_path_test","ref":"dev_path_test","sha":"ac24684138acd98ebd91297cf019a4792ca68b7b","user":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486167626,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPpUSg","name":"flink","full_name":"WencongLiu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-16T06:04:40Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T09:40:16Z","closed_at":"2023-07-19T09:40:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b096c5cba541822d3d8aba0fc81faba5fcce82d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23002/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23002/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23002/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0f40083c7bfcf95c9b319c83bd9d3519e0a52d92","head":{"label":"WencongLiu:dev_dataset_dev","ref":"dev_dataset_dev","sha":"0f40083c7bfcf95c9b319c83bd9d3519e0a52d92","user":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486167626,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPpUSg","name":"flink","full_name":"WencongLiu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently when group by window time columns on a proctime window operator result will get a wrong plan which may result hang for ever in runtime(this only happens with informally supported forms, all standard forms cascaded window aggregation works fine). \r\nThis is because an incorrectly translation that create an event-time window agg operator in such case, but actually there's no corresponding window assigner to trigger the window (no local timeservice neither).  For the fix, we convert these cases into a normal group aggregate to make it works and doesn't break anything.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nfix the matching logic of `StreamPhysicalWindowAggregateRule` in proctime mode and related path\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nadds test cases to verify the plan changes in `WindowAggregateTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request allows using `BLOCKING`  in streaming execution mode if operator only outputs records on end of input. Checkpoint is still supported after all of the non-pipeline tasks have finished. See this [[FLIP-331](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-331%3A+Support+EndOfStreamTrigger+and+isOutputOnEOF+operator+attribute+to+optimize+task+deployment)] for details.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add an internal method to `StreamOperator`  to allow implementations to report whether the operator will output records on end of input and whether it supports internal sort.\r\n- Add the `EOFCoGroupOperator` to optimize the DataStream#coGroup when output on end of input.\r\n- Add the `EOFAggregationOperator` to optimize the DataStream#aggregation when output on end of input.\r\n- Add the `EndOfStreamTrigger` in `GlobalWindows` to support a trigger that fires only if the input stream reaches EOF.\r\n- Optimize job when schedule and execute the output-on-EOF operator in batch mode.\r\n-  If there are blocking-typed partition tasks in the job, Periodic scheduling CheckpointScheduler will not be scheduled when `JobStatus` switches to `RUNNING`, until there is no task writing data to a blocking-typed partition. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Add integration tests `OperatorOutputEOFITCase` and unit tests in `StreamingJobGraphGeneratorTest` to confirm that, in `RuntimeExecutionMode.STREAMING`, the operator has been schedule correctly and the downstream node would not be deployed before the output-on-EOF operator node has finished.\r\n  - Add the unit tests in `StreamGraphGeneratorTest` and `StreamGraphGeneratorBatchExecutionTest`  to confirm that the operator  will set `InputRequirement` correctly.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate our optimization improvements，we run each benchmark in different execution modes and configurations. Each result is measured by taking the average execution time across 5 runs with the given configuration.\r\n\r\nWe run benchmarks on a MacBook with the latest Flink 1.18-snapshot and parallelism=1. Default standalone cluster configuration is used except:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\njobmanager.memory.process.size: 6400m\r\ntaskmanager.memory.process.size: 6912m\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Execute DataStream#CoGroup\r\n\r\nThis benchmark uses DataStream#coGroup to process records from two bounded inputs. Each input will generate records with (key = i, value = i) for i from 1 to 8*10^7.\r\n\r\nBelow is the DataStream program code snippet.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndata1.coGroup(data2)\r\n     .where(tuple -> tuple.f0)\r\n     .equalTo(tuple -> tuple.f0)\r\n     .window(GlobalWindows.createWithEndOfStreamTrigger())\r\n     .apply(new CustomCoGroupFunction())\r\n     .addSink(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following result shows the throughput (records/sec) when the benchmark is executed in streaming mode, batch mode and optimized streaming mode after this PR.\r\n\r\nThe result shows that DataStream#coGroup in optimized streaming mode can be 22X as fast as streaming mode and 3X as fast as batch mode. \r\n\r\n|         STREAMING         |           BATCH           |     Optimized STREAMING     |\r\n| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: |\r\n| 66 ± 1 (100%, 1202426 ms) | 491 ± 5 (743%, 162731 ms) | 1506 ± 10 (2281%, 53098 ms) |\r\n\r\n### Execute DataStream#Aggregate\r\n\r\nThis benchmark uses DataStream#aggregate to process 8*10^7 records. These records are evenly distributed across 8*10^5 keys. More specifically, the source will generate records with (key = i, value = i) for i from 1 to 8*10^5, and repeat this process 100 times.\r\n\r\nBelow is the DataStream program code snippet.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nevents\r\n        .keyBy(value -> value.f0)\r\n        .window(GlobalWindows.createWithEndOfStreamTrigger())\r\n        .aggregate(new Aggregator())\r\n        .addSink(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following result shows the throughput (records/sec) when the benchmark is executed in streaming mode, batch mode and optimized streaming mode after this PR.\r\n\r\nThe result shows that DataStream#aggregate in optimized streaming mode can be 10X as fast as streaming mode and 11% faster than batch mode.\r\n\r\n|         STREAMING         |           BATCH            |    Optimized STREAMING     |\r\n| :-----------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: |\r\n| 163 ± 0 (100%, 490478 ms) | 1561 ± 16 (957%, 51237 ms) | 1733 ± 9 (1063%, 46143 ms) |\r\n\r\n### OperatorDelayedDeploy\r\n\r\nThe following program demonstrates the scenario described in the motivation section. The program needs to pre-processes records from a bounded source (Source1) using an operator (Process1) which only emits results after its input has ended. Then anther operator(Process2) needs to process records emitted by Process1 with records from an unbounded source, and emit results with low processing latency in real-time.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nsource1.keyBy(value -> value.f0)\r\n    .window(GlobalWindows.createWithEndOfStreamTrigger())\r\n    .aggregate(new MyAggregator()).name(\"Process1\")\r\n    .connect(source2.keyBy(value -> value.f0))\r\n    .transform(\"Process2\", Types.INT, new MyProcessOperator())\r\n    .addSink(...);  \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Resource Utilization\r\n\r\nWe can use this program to demonstrate that the program requires less slot resources. More specifically, suppose we configure the standalone cluster with taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots = 2, and set the Source1，Process1, Source2 and Process2 in 4 different SlotSharingGroups, the program will fail to be deployed before this FLIP. And the program can be deployed successfully after this FLIP. This is because `Source2` and `Process2` can be deplyed after `Source1`，`Process1` finished and released their slots.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we can use this program to demonstrate that it can achieve higher performance because `Process2` will not need to keep buffer records emitted by `Source2` in its memory while `Process1` has not reached EOF. More specifically, the program can fail with OOM before this FLIP when the number of records in inputs is high. And the program can finish successfully without OOM after this FLIP.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Translate \"Custom Serialization for Managed State\" page into Chinese*\r\n*The page url is https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/zh/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/serialization/custom_serialization/*\r\n*The markdown file is located in docs/content.zh/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/serialization/custom_serialization.md*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*translate `docs/content.zh/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/serialization/custom_serialization.md`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-15T02:29:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:13:22Z","closed_at":"2023-07-15T02:29:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6203410795fb32b2b05f37ee5d68fa7325bb676","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8d03ff1da82101fecd59068c487b78b6bb3c9f24","head":{"label":"ping-cai:installation-translate","ref":"installation-translate","sha":"8d03ff1da82101fecd59068c487b78b6bb3c9f24","user":{"login":"ping-cai","id":57218417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjE4NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57218417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai","html_url":"https://github.com/ping-cai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":664854664,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ6DgiA","name":"flink","full_name":"ping-cai/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ping-cai","id":57218417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjE4NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57218417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai","html_url":"https://github.com/ping-cai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ping-cai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ping-cai/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo make Flink support executing call procedure statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -  The first commit make Flink support convert call procedure statement to a `CallOperation`.\r\n      - When lookup a `SqlFunctionCategory`, if it's `USER_DEFINED_PROCEDURE`, convert it to `BridgingSqlProcedure`\r\n         which bridges {@link Procedure} to Calcite's representation of a function.\r\n      - Add  `SqlProcedureConverter` to convert the `SqlNode` standing for call statement to `CallOperation`. If the sqlNode\r\n         is  a `SqlBasicCall` and the operator is `BridgingSqlProcedure`, it should be sql cal statement.\r\n      - While convert the `SqlNode` to `CallOperation`, get the `BridgingSqlProcedure` called, run the type inference to infer the type including types of input args and output for the `Procedure`. Then, reduce the operands in the `BridgingSqlProcedure` to get the constant for call procedure. Use the reduced operands with Flink internal represent along with inputs and outputs type to construct a `PlannerCallProcedureOperation`.\r\n      \r\n  - The second commit make Flink support to execute `CallOperation` which then enable Flink support executing call procedure statement\r\n     - In `PlannerCallProcedureOperation`, implement the logic for execution. \r\n        First, convert the  operands with  internal represent  to external represent which is what the procedure deserves. \r\n        Second,  call the method `procedure#call(xxx)` via reflection.\r\n        Third, get the return value of the method `procedure#call(xxx)` and wrap it to a `TableResult`.\r\n      - Set the `StreamingEnv` to the context  while executing `CallProcedureOperation` in `OperationExecutor` for sql gateway for the procedure will need the `StreamingEnv` to submit Flink job. Otherwise, the procedure can't get the right `StreamingEnv` while executing via sql-gateway/sql-client.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nUT & IT\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

[okio](https://github.com/square/okio) from 1.17.2 to 3.4.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/square/okio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">okio's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 3.4.0</h2>\n<p><em>2023-07-07</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Adapt a Java NIO FileSystem (<code>java.nio.file.FileSystem</code>) as an Okio FileSystem using\n<code>fileSystem.asOkioFileSystem()</code>.</li>\n<li>New: Adapt Android’s <code>AssetManager</code> as an Okio FileSystem using <code>AssetFileSystem</code>. This is in the\nnew <code>okio-assetfilesystem</code> module. Android applications should prefer this over\n<code>FileSystem.RESOURCES</code> as it’s faster to load.</li>\n<li>Fix: Don't crash decoding GZIP files when the optional extra data (<code>XLEN</code>) is 32 KiB or larger.</li>\n<li>Fix: Resolve symlinks in <code>FakeFileSystem.canonicalize()</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix: Report the correct <code>createdAtMillis</code> in <code>NodeJsFileSystem</code> file metadata. We were\nincorrectly using <code>ctimeMs</code>, where <code>c</code> means <em>changed</em>, not <em>created</em>.</li>\n<li>Fix: <code>UnsafeCursor</code> is now <code>Closeable</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 3.3.0</h2>\n<p><em>2023-01-07</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Don't leak resources when <code>use {}</code> is used with a non-local return. We introduced this\nperformance and stability bug by not considering that non-local returns execute neither the\n<code>return</code> nor <code>catch</code> control flows.</li>\n<li>Fix: Use a sealed interface for <code>BufferedSink</code> and <code>BufferedSource</code>. These were never intended\nfor end-users to implement, and we're happy that Kotlin now allows us to express that in our API.</li>\n<li>New: Change internal locks from <code>synchronized</code> to <code>ReentrantLock</code> and <code>Condition</code>. We expect this\nto improve help when using Okio with Java virtual threads ([Project Loom][loom]).</li>\n<li>Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.8.0][kotlin_1_8_0].</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 3.2.0</h2>\n<p><em>2022-06-26</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Configure the multiplatform artifact (<code>com.squareup.okio:okio:3.x.x</code>) to depend on the\nJVM artifact (<code>com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm:3.x.x</code>) for Maven builds. This should work-around an\nissue where Maven doesn't interpret Gradle metadata.</li>\n<li>Fix: Change <code>CipherSource</code> and <code>CipherSink</code> to recover if the cipher doesn't support streaming.\nThis should work around a crash with AES/GCM ciphers on Android.</li>\n<li>New: Enable compatibility with non-hierarchical projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 3.1.0</h2>\n<p><em>2022-04-19</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.6.20][kotlin_1_6_20].</li>\n<li>New: Support [Hierarchical project structure][hierarchical_projects]. If you're using Okio in a\nmultiplatform project please upgrade your project to Kotlin 1.6.20 (or newer) to take advantage\nof this. With hierarchical projects it's easier to use properties like <code>FileSystem.SYSTEM</code> that</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

schedule a rescale when last rescale was done less than interval-min seconds ago, rescale immediately otherwise.\r\n-  Add the ability to force a rescale when last rescale was done more than interval-max seconds ago regardless if the requirements are met (context#shouldRescale)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded 3 tests to ExecutingTest test case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: adding to parameters related to timing\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes: adaptive scheduler in JobManager\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA preparation for FLINK-14068 to finally remove `org.apache.flink.api.common.time.Time` and `org.apache.flink.streaming.api.windowing.time.Time` (related to [FLIP-335](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-335%3A+Removing+Flink%27s+Time+classes)).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nI went through any class that was listed by the following bash command:\r\n```\r\ngrep \"import.*org\\.apache\\.flink\\..*\\.time.Time;\" $(find . -name \"*.java\" -exec grep -H \"@Public\\|@Experimental\" {} \\; | cut -d':' -f1 | sort -u) | cut -d: -f1\r\n```\r\nand looked for occurrences of the regex `Time[^a-zA-Z0-9]` in the code and docs.\r\n\r\nThe JavaDoc was updated accordingly pointing to the replacing method.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManual check - I appreciate any proposal on how to verify the change in a better way. :thinking: \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: yes\r\n \r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix thread-safe bug of channel state executor when some subtasks are closed while other subtasks are starting.\r\n\r\nWhen one subtask is closing, it will call the `ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorImpl#releaseSubtask`. The `releaseSubtask` [method](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/2dfff436c09821fb658bf8d289206b9ef85bb25b/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/checkpoint/channel/ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorImpl.java#L390) will hold 2 locks at the different time.\r\n\r\n- The first one is `ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorImpl#lock`, and update the `isRegistering` from true to false.\r\n- The second one is `onRegistered.accept(this)` will hold `ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorFactory#lock` and update the `ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorFactory#executor`\r\n\r\nHowever, these 2 locks are held at the different time. The following calls will meet a bug:\r\n\r\n- Subtask 1 finished the first step of `releaseSubtask`, and doesn't hold the second lock.\r\n- Subtask 2 is starting, and call the `executor#registerSubtask`\r\n\r\nSubtask2 will throw `This executor has been registered.`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nEnsure that update the `isRegistering` and call the `onRegistered` within one registerLock. They should guarantee idempotence.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCreated 2 threads, one thread creates the executor and register subtask, one thread releases these subtask. This bug can reproduce by the following test .\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*ProducerMergedPartitionFileIndex supports caching regions and spilling regions to file when the cache is too large*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nReuse the classes `HsFileDataIndexSpilledRegionManager` and  `HsFileDataIndexCache` to cache or spill the `ProducerMergedPartitionFileIndex`.\r\n\r\nNote that the option `taskmanager.network.hybrid-shuffle.spill-index-segment-size` is renamed because the static class Segment in `HsFileDataIndexSpilledRegionManagerImpl` is renamed to `RegionGroup`.\r\n\r\n  - *[**commit 1**] Introduce FileRegionManager to support writing a region to file or reading a region from file*\r\n  - *[**commit 2**] The region index introduces Region generics to replace the original InternalRegion to achieve cache and spilling regions to files*\r\n  - *[**commit 3**] ProducerMergedPartitionFileIndex supports caching regions and spilling regions to file when the cache is too large* \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- This change can be covered by the exist tests `HsFileDataIndexSpilledRegionManagerImplTest`, `HsFileDataIndexCacheTest`, `ProducerMergedPartitionFileIndexTest`.\r\n- Added tests in `HsRegionWriteReadUtilsTest` to verify the writing or reading of the base region.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-12T03:16:54Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:13:35Z","closed_at":"2023-07-19T02:26:25Z","merged_at":"2023-07-19T02:26:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"1786e2ddfd1a1df5e907f5719138f63e819cb1a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c491675a2bdd250126b54300b9a8e7b1550a5c01","head":{"label":"TanYuxin-tyx:FLINK-32576","ref":"FLINK-32576","sha":"c491675a2bdd250126b54300b9a8e7b1550a5c01","user":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383718803,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3MTg4MDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"TanYuxin-tyx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pr is aims to support JSON_OBJECTAGG & JSON_ARRAYAGG use with other aggregate functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Modify WrapJsonAggFunctionArgumentsRule\r\n- Adding test cases\r\n- Modify docs\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAdding UT and ITCase\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:  no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the incomplete serialization of ResolvedCatalogTable caused by the newly introduced time travel interface\r\n\r\nIn order to implement time travel, we added Snapshot information to DefaultCatalogTable, but Snapshot is not used when ResolvedCatalogTable is serialized and deserialized, we break the contract that ResolvedCatalogTable is fully serializable.\r\n\r\nSo, we should change CatalogPropertiesUtil to fix this.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  Fix the de/serialization in CatalogPropertiesUtil::serializeCatalogTable and  CatalogPropertiesUtil:: deserializeCatalogTable\r\n  - Fix the equals and hashCode method of DefaultCatalogTable\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *org.apache.flink.table.catalog.CatalogBaseTableResolutionTest#testPropertyDeSerialization*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce cluster-level file merging related configurations.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add `state.checkpoints.file-merging.*` configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n`ConfigOptionsYamlSpecTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-10T02:24:04Z","updated_at":"2024-04-15T06:29:12Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T06:21:41Z","merged_at":"2024-04-15T06:21:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"c601c70e5c4a9316bee049c613c011b14fab7f5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4b30a700c8b1155e62898d963742cfbcb91d9a9c","head":{"label":"fredia:FLINK-32440","ref":"FLINK-32440","sha":"4b30a700c8b1155e62898d963742cfbcb91d9a9c","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

format\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe introduced contenderID in a lot of places with [FLINK-26522](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-26522). The original multi-component leader election classes of [FLINK-24038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24038) used componentId.\r\n\r\nRevisiting that naming made me realize that it's actually wrong. A contender is a specific instance of a component that participates in the leader election. A component, in this sense, is the more abstract concept. contenderID refers to an ID for the specific contender instance but the IDs we're sharing are actually referring to a Flink component and therefore, are the same between different contenders which compete for leadership for the same component. This contradicts the definition of an identifier.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRenames of all occurrences that match the case-insensitive regex `contender.?id`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nGrep through the code for `contender.?id`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the accumulator is responsible for requesting all buffers, leading to an inaccurate number of requested buffers for each tier.\r\nTo address this issue, buffer ownership must be transferred from the accumulator to the tiers when writing them, which will enable the memory manager to maintain a correct number of requested buffers for different owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Tiered storage memory manager supports ownership transfer for buffers*\r\n \r\n**Version 1 (Deprecated. Do not use this way to fix anymore)**:\r\n1. In order to transfer ownership, added a new API `TieredStorageMemoryManager#transferBufferOwnership`.\r\n2. If `TierProducerAgent#tryWrite` returns `true` (indicating the write is successful), then \r\n the buffer has been written to the tier(once written, the buffer may be consumed or flushed immediately, so the buffer recycler can not be updated after `TierProducerAgent#tryWrite`), `TieredStorageProducerClientImpl#writeAccumulatedBuffer` can not update the buffer recycler anymore, so the updating buffer recycler process is moved into each tier.\r\n3. Because the updating buffer recycler process is moved into each tier and the buffer recycler can not be updated after compression, the buffer compress process is also moved into each tier.\r\n4. To use the right buffer recycler, added a new API `TieredStorageMemoryManager#getBufferRecycler`.\r\n\r\n**Version 2**:\r\n1. `Buffer` added a new API `setRecycler`\r\n2. Added a new API for memory manager `TieredStorageMemoryManager#transferBufferOwnership`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to verify the buffer ownership transfer in `TieredStorageMemoryManagerImplTest`*\r\n- *Added tests to verify getting the buffer recycler in `TieredStorageMemoryManagerImplTest`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-06T07:36:01Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:13:55Z","closed_at":"2023-07-12T03:12:29Z","merged_at":"2023-07-12T03:12:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"2dfff436c09821fb658bf8d289206b9ef85bb25b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8e86acf7f42ddcac01f0c3b9c3fb7b7f19cfc70b","head":{"label":"TanYuxin-tyx:FLINK-32549","ref":"FLINK-32549","sha":"8e86acf7f42ddcac01f0c3b9c3fb7b7f19cfc70b","user":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383718803,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3MTg4MDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"TanYuxin-tyx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix the buffer leaking when buffer accumulator is released*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Fix the buffer leaking when buffer accumulators is released*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests for in the `SortBufferAccumulatorTest` and `HashBufferAccumulatorTest`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fixes test_java_sql_ddl to works in JDK17*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

to 1.17, see [Flink-32362](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32362)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-05T03:49:09Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:14:01Z","closed_at":"2023-07-05T13:45:28Z","merged_at":"2023-07-05T13:45:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"7219ca189df88393f10e0b874edaceee5c3e92bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/736db13b75cff5ad19a4bd298dcaa2556044b7a9","head":{"label":"LoveHeat:release-1.17","ref":"release-1.17","sha":"736db13b75cff5ad19a4bd298dcaa2556044b7a9","user":{"login":"LoveHeat","id":12112111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTEyMTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12112111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat","html_url":"https://github.com/LoveHeat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":448291245,"node_id":"R_kgDOGrhhrQ","name":"flink","full_name":"LoveHeat/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LoveHeat","id":12112111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTEyMTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12112111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat","html_url":"https://github.com/LoveHeat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LoveHeat/flink","description":"Apache

to 1.16, see [Flink-32362](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32362)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-05T03:45:53Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:14:02Z","closed_at":"2023-07-05T13:46:22Z","merged_at":"2023-07-05T13:46:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"1847b849e9c96755c3e4dc225ae2b4f036d84e65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e0e4fb991483868df9693a71194f10028ec823c7","head":{"label":"LoveHeat:releas-1.16","ref":"releas-1.16","sha":"e0e4fb991483868df9693a71194f10028ec823c7","user":{"login":"LoveHeat","id":12112111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTEyMTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12112111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat","html_url":"https://github.com/LoveHeat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":448291245,"node_id":"R_kgDOGrhhrQ","name":"flink","full_name":"LoveHeat/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LoveHeat","id":12112111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTEyMTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12112111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat","html_url":"https://github.com/LoveHeat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LoveHeat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LoveHeat/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement the array_sort function to extract a subset of elements from an array.\r\n\r\nReturns the array in sorted order. Sorts the input array in ascending or descending order according to the natural ordering of the array elements. NULL elements are placed at the beginning of the returned array in ascending order or at the end of the returned array in descending order. If the array itself is null, the function will return null. The optional ascendingOrder argument defaults to true if not specified.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nARRAY_SORT for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n\r\n`ARRAY_SORT(array, [ascendingOrder])`\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\narray: The array we want to sort.\r\nascendingOrder: this is an option, default and true stand for ascending order, false stand for descending order.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns:  \r\nif the array is null or ascendingOrder is null return null. if array is empty return empty.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT([5, 3, 2, 1, 0, null])\r\nOutput: [null, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT([5, 3, 2, 1, 0, null], true)\r\nOutput: [null, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT([null, 1, 2, 3, 5], false)\r\nOutput: [5, 3, 2, 1, null]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT(null)\r\nnull\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SLICE(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], null)\r\nnull\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee also:\r\nspark: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#array_sort\r\ndatabrick:https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/functions/array_sort.html\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- This change added tests in CollectionFunctionsITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of MAP_UNION \r\n\r\nReturns a map created by merging two maps, 'map1' and 'map2'. This two maps should have same data structure. If there are overlapping keys, the value from 'map2' will overwrite the value from 'map1'. If any of maps are null, return null.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nMAP_UNION for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\n- Syntax:\r\n`MAP_UNION(map1, map2)`\r\n- Arguments:\r\nmap1:The first map to be merged.\r\nmap2:The second map to be merged.\r\n- Returns:If there are overlapping keys, the value from 'map2' will overwrite the value from 'map1'. If any of maps are null, return null.\r\n- Examples:\r\n\r\nMerging maps with unique keys:\r\n```\r\nmap1 = ['a': 1, 'b': 2] map2 = ['c': 3, 'd': 4] \r\nmap_union(map1, map2)  \r\nOutput: ['a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMerging maps with overlapping keys:\r\n```\r\nmap1 = ['a': 1, 'b': 2] map2 = ['b': 3, 'c': 4] \r\nmap_union[dict1, dict2] \r\nOutput: ['a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- This change added tests in MapFunctionITCase.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-04T17:38:47Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:14:05Z","closed_at":"2023-07-04T17:56:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"485b88781ba45fe0879763595ae533ea785e8666","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8225581da310bc9a84eb1ef9f9b9a7d5e23b815e","head":{"label":"hanyuzheng7:FLINK-32261]-table-Add-MAP_UNION-function","ref":"FLINK-32261]-table-Add-MAP_UNION-function","sha":"8225581da310bc9a84eb1ef9f9b9a7d5e23b815e","user":{"login":"hanyuzheng7","id":135176127,"node_id":"U_kgDOCA6fvw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135176127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7","html_url":"https://github.com/hanyuzheng7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":648727095,"node_id":"R_kgDOJqrKNw","name":"flink","full_name":"hanyuzheng7/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanyuzheng7","id":135176127,"node_id":"U_kgDOCA6fvw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135176127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7","html_url":"https://github.com/hanyuzheng7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanyuzheng7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanyuzheng7/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-04T12:31:05Z","updated_at":"2023-07-07T07:40:31Z","closed_at":"2023-07-07T07:40:31Z","merged_at":"2023-07-07T07:40:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"d3a9ccbca5cfbc0508b401c58e446521aa4aceaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/22948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/22948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/98b1bd9756888b3fbf4ae3b32abf8d6d7e724691","head":{"label":"liuyongvs:hotfix_doc","ref":"hotfix_doc","sha":"98b1bd9756888b3fbf4ae3b32abf8d6d7e724691","user":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278584612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzg1ODQ2MTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyongvs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Support time travel *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *When validating, parse the Snapshot information to obtain the Schema corresponding to the Snapshot.*\r\n  - *Convert RelNode will also use Snapshot information to generate the corresponding Schema corresponding to the Snapshot.*\r\n  - * Modify the relevant implementation of Flink Schema to adapt to the Snapshot usage scenario of Calcite.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUnit Test\r\n*  Test time travel syntax with constant Timestamp String\r\n*  Test time travel syntax with simple expression scenarios \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen flink perform `create temporary function` or `create system function` with a jar file, it will register the jar file to `ResourceManager` and add it to the `ClassLoader`. This cause the `SHOW JARS` statement can list the jar files for these functions, and even when a job does not use these function, the jar file will be aded to the job's classpath.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to address this issue with three steps:\r\n1. Create temporary or system function\r\n    a> Download the jar file from remote as needed, which is the same as before for these functions.\r\n    b> Add jar files for temporary and system functions to a new class `FunctionResourceManager` in `ResourceManager` when they are created.\r\n    c> Create a new classloader with the added jar files and validate the function class\r\n2. Job uses temporary or system function\r\n    a> Register the jar files for the functions to `ResourceManager`, which will be added to the classpath of the job\r\n    b> Add the jar files to the classloader for the job\r\n3. Drop temporary or system function\r\n    a> There is reference counter in `FunctionResourceManager` for each jar file\r\n    b> Register or unregister function to the `FunctionResourceManager` will update the reference counter\r\n    c> The jar file in `FunctionResourceManager` will be removed when the reference counter comes to 0\r\n\r\nIn this way, the jar files for temporary or system function will not be listed in `SHOW JARS` and will not be added to the classpath and classloader when a job does not use it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Added `FunctionResourceManager` to register and unregister jar files for temporary and system functions\r\n  - Don't register jar files to `resourceInfos` and `userClassLoader` when temporary and system functions are created, register jar files to `FunctionResourceManager`\r\n  - Register jar files to `resourceInfos` and `userClassLoader` when the functions are used in a job\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added `SHOW JARS;` in `function.q` after creating a temporary functions and the result is empty\r\n  - Updated `FunctionITCase.testCreateTemporarySystemFunctionByUsingJar` to show jars after creating system function\r\n  - Added `ResourceManagerTest.testRegisterFunctionResource` to verify the jar file will no be added to classloader when it is registered in `FunctionResourceManager`\r\n  - Added `ResourceManagerTest.testRegisterFunctionResource` to check the jar file can be registered and unregistered in `FunctionResourceManager` with reference counter\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Introduce some base interfaces for CatalogStore*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce CatalogStore Interface*\r\n  - *Introduce CatalogStoreFactory for create CatalogStore*\r\n  - *Introduce GenericInMemoryCatalogStore and GenericInMemoryCatalogStoreFactory*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd some unit test to test InMemoryCatalogStore and InMemoryCatalogStoreFactory\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

PR === FLINK-32381\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe driver has two different ways to communicate with the `DefaultLeaderElectionService` right now:\r\n(1) Through the `Listener` interface\r\n(2) Through the `FatalErrorHandler`\r\n\r\nThis PR merges the two ways into a single communication channel through the `Listener` interface\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Removed `FatalErrorHandler` field from driver and its constructor\r\n* Adds `onError` to `Listener` interface\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* `TestingLeaderElectionListener` implements `onError` and some helper methods to retrieve any outstanding error\r\n* `TestingLeaderElectionListener` is used in tests where `FatalErrorHandler` was used beforehand\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpgrade GCS connector to 2.2.15.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpgrade the GCS Connector bundled in the Flink distro from version 2.2.11 to 2.2.15. The new release contains multiple bug fixes and enhancements discussed in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.15/gcs/CHANGES.md) . Notable changes include: \r\n\r\n1. Improved traceability \r\n2. Experimental support for read and write via GRPC\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n`mvn -Pfast -pl flink-filesystems/flink-gs-fs-hadoop clean test`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable
