normal circumstances those jobs will wait for a short time\r\n(4-15 minutes depenfding on the state of the base image).\r\nHowever there might be some cases when there are a lot of jobs\r\nor when there is some queueing problems in GitHub that\r\nthe \"Build Images\" job will be queued and not start quickly.\r\n\r\nThis happened on 24th of August 2020 for example when several\r\njobs failed because the \"Build Image\" was queued and only\r\nrun after the \"CI Build\" job timed out.\r\n\r\nUsually those situations tends to be resolved by GitHub support\r\nor they resolve themselves as the jobs will be finishing and\r\nfreing the queue. However in those cases we should give the\r\nwaiting job as much time as GitHub Action allows by default\r\nfor the job to run (360 minutes). This is no harm - we can\r\nalwayc cancel those jobs manually and they are just two\r\njobs running so it should not cause any problem.\r\n\r\nNote that if someone would see that the job is running for\r\na long time - the contributor will likely push amended\r\ncommit and it will also cancel such waiting job, so\r\nthis is even less likely to have long runnning waiting jobs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^

don't know the reason, but if we omit the `session.commit()` that I just added, `test_skip_all_except`  fails because task3 state is None instead of SKIPPED. I think it's an issue with sqlalchemy or sqlite and not much to do with Airflow itself.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: The impact of this bug being fixed here is pretty minimal and hard to catch because even though this line does not set the state to SKIPPED, the newly introduced `NotPreviouslySkippedDep` actually causes the scheduler to skip the task that are supposed to be skipped. So to the user, this bug being fixed here had almost no impact other than in some test cases. But this session.commit() is needed in case in the future someone calls `skip_all_except()` and expects the state to be set to SKIPPED for the skipped tests).","created_at":"2020-08-20T06:12:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T08:20:16Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T20:08:13Z","merged_at":"2020-09-22T20:08:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"423a382678deac5cb161d38e9266ce47b5666344","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/milestones/7/labels","id":5729187,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTcyOTE4Nw==","number":7,"title":"Airflow

`exit` and `quit` functions are actually `site.Quitter` objects and are loaded, at interpreter start up, from `site.py`. However, if the interpreter is started with the `-S` flag, or a custom `site.py` is used then `exit` and `quit` may not be present. It is recommended to use `sys.exit()` which is built into the interpreter and is guaranteed to be present.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `exit()` was used and wouls fail if the interpreter is passed the `-S` option.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

adds permission checking to the stable API. This will integrate with the endpoints as a function decorator, with the following format `@security.requires_access([(\"can_edit\", \"Pool\")])`. The decorator should be placed after the `@security.requires_authentication` decorator.\r\n\r\nThe permissions should use the new resource-focused permissions, as explained in related issue (#8112), rather than the existing permissions designed around UI views.\r\n\r\nrelated: #8112 \r\n\r\nWhen complete, this PR will include the following pieces:\r\n\r\n- [x]  `@security.requires_access()`
