to: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42159\r\n\r\nThis will abstract the handling of common FIlters, Search and Sort query param so we do not have to copy and past the same `query.where(...)`  on all endpoints that are using this same logic.\r\n\r\nThis allows:\r\n- To remove some logic from the views, and only keep http related thing. (serialization/deserialization, query param validation, etc...). Aim for a more layed and decouple AIP code. (hexagonal / onion architecture is an inspiration, but that's too early and not a priority). Cf the custom code removed from the `get_dags` view.\r\n- Initialize some reusable logic for the db layer\r\n- Will allow to add more complex filters that cannot be done today, especially on the `order_by` because we were using a sqlalchemy `text` clause that do not work with hybrid properties. (cf follow up PR to add ordering by `dag_display_name`)\r\n\r\nThe goal is to have that extended and have a library of `query params` that can be re-used accross all the RestAPI.","created_at":"2024-09-18T14:37:17Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T10:04:03Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T10:04:01Z","merged_at":"2024-09-23T10:04:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"5bc378a5ede388636f45de8f87d6d21cbf13607f","assignee":{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7382489096,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABuAfYCA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/AIP-84","name":"AIP-84","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"Modern

does not currently have any logging for listeners, and only rely on individual listeners to log responsibly. This causes issues when a listener does not do it since it would have no trace at all in logs, and it is extremely difficult to find exactly what the offending component is (especially we would not even know a listener is at fault).\r\n\r\nThis uses pluggy's hok monitoring feature to add logs when Airflow is calling a hook, and when a hook finishes executing. This should allow us to more easily identify when a hook emits an unhandled exception (it'd trigger the 'before' logging but not 'after'), and also provide some context what's passed into the hook for debugging.\r\n\r\nRef: https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#call-monitoring\r\n\r\nI also referenced how Datasette does

discussed in the Airflow 3.0 dev calls, the first step for the new SLA system is stripping the existing implementation out.\r\n\r\nI did this PR in multiple commits to try to make it more transparent.  In this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Remove everything related to SLA in the code.\r\n2. Add back the absolute minimum so that existing DAGs won't throw an exception.  @bbovenzi  said he can add a UI banner so any DAG which implements an SLA will get a notification that SLA is not working in 3.0, but we don't want all existing DAGs to start throwing exceptions left and right either.\r\n3. Added a log message to models/dag which triggers if the DAG is init'ed with an \"sla_miss_callback\" \r\n4.

to changes introduced in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36205, we experienced breakage in our SQLExecuteQueryOperator. In short, our assumption was that the handler is able to also transform the data type returned from the query. For example our handler looked something like this:\r\n```python\r\ndef custom_handler(cursor):\r\n    results = fetch_all_handler(cursor)\r\n    columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]\r\n    result_dicts = [dict(zip(columns, record)) for record in results]\r\n    return [SomeDataclass(col_a=d[“COL_A”]\r\n``` \r\nAs that was changed, that led to errors in our dags. We now moved to use the  `_process_output` method as we should’ve done in the first place, but we this type hint will prevent further confusion as to what are the constraints of the handler passed to the operator.

PR will introduce new Operators for Google Search 360 service and remove the already failing operators.\r\nHere is a bit of an explanation for clearer understanding;\r\n\r\nThe [previous Search Ads 360 Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/how-tos/reporting) (which is currently in use in google-provider) was already decommissioned on June 30, 2024 ([see deatils](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/migration)). All new reporting development should use the [new Search Ads 360 Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/reporting/overview).\r\nCurrently, the Reporting operators, sensors and hooks are failing due to the decommission. The new API is not a replacement for the old one, it has a different approach and APIs. Therefore, we needed to implement new operators and remove the old ones. This PR does **NOT** break any working DAG, because it replaces not working functionality with the new one.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

clearer.","created_at":"2024-09-16T06:43:49Z","updated_at":"2024-09-20T06:45:45Z","closed_at":"2024-09-20T06:45:43Z","merged_at":"2024-09-20T06:45:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"8d816fb8c455e81b8a186da37c6009316839bfcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

PR addresses an issue introduced in Airflow 2.10.1, where airflow_local_settings.py is no longer loaded from the dags/ directory as it's no longer included in sys.path during initialization. This update ensures users are informed to place airflow_local_settings.py in a directory that is part of sys.path, such as $AIRFLOW_HOME/config.\r\n\r\n### Why this fix is necessary:\r\nThe breaking change in version 2.10.1 can cause unexpected behavior for users relying on local settings in the dags/ folder. By documenting this change and recommending the correct path for placing the file, this PR resolves confusion and prevents issues related to Airflow configuration.\r\n\r\n### How this was tested:\r\nThis was tested by placing the airflow_local_settings.py file in both $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags/ and $AIRFLOW_HOME/config/, confirming that the latter is correctly loaded, while the former is no longer recognized.","created_at":"2024-09-14T06:05:26Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T06:25:02Z","closed_at":"2024-09-14T06:25:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac3ab67217a5c2d8e4f0daf765a01cf58b2df586","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/42234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/42234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/42234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6afe5be7f60105e95b829433c0f921f506af954e","head":{"label":"Rustix69:fix-airflow-local-settings-doc","ref":"fix-airflow-local-settings-doc","sha":"6afe5be7f60105e95b829433c0f921f506af954e","user":{"login":"Rustix69","id":139000437,"node_id":"U_kgDOCEj6dQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/139000437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69","html_url":"https://github.com/Rustix69","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rustix69/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"3f6497b528a9ca50c363f80b74025046aaec4215","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

AWS [added](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/09/session-reuse-amazon-redshift-data-api/) [session reuse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/data-api.html#data-api-calling-considerations-session-reuse) to the Redshift Data API. It allows to, say, create a temporary table in one statement, and select from it in a subsequent one.\r\nI think it would be useful that `RedshiftDataOperator` supports this new feature.\r\n\r\n# Decisions\r\n- the hook and operator's `database` arguments now optional because when the session ID is provided, boto3 doesn't allow database to be specified. Because this becomes a named argument, I had to move it after `sql`. If users of the operator and hook rely on the position to pass the argument that could break things ⚠️ . Note that [boto3 only requires Sql](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/redshift-data/client/execute_statement.html).\r\n- the hook now returns an object containing the statement ID and session ID instead of just a statement ID. I choose a `dataclass` instead of a dict to make it harder to make a mistake when indexing the keys. If users use the hook in their tasks or custom operators, this could also break things ⚠️ \r\n- fixed the typo in the `parse_statement_resposne` method. It's a public one. So, again, there is a risk of breaking change. ⚠️ \r\n- boto3's validation error messages are not very useful when the session ID is a non-UUID string, or if no database, workgroup or session ID was provided, so I added checks in the hook.\r\n\r\n# To do\r\n- [x] update docs\r\n- [x] update changelog\r\n- [x] update and run examples\r\n  - [x] example_redshift.py\r\n  - [x] example_redshift_s3_transfers.py\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

the advise from @potiuk I was splitting my contributions with the new edge provider.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately tests with back-compat provider tests fail because:\r\n- Edge provider is not compatible for old airflow versions lower than 2.10\r\n- Therefore the Edge provider is excluded\r\n- The test list is filtered for all skipped packages\r\n- In case a PR is made _only_ for edge provider, no positivle list to test is left-over\r\n- Pytest in this cases attempts to test _ALL_ tests - which obviously fail as not being compliant to old airflow versions\r\n\r\nWith this PR Breeze skips

up of: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42196\r\n\r\nYou can just review the last commit. This is short one that add a no-op decorator to be able to mark endpoint as migrated over to the new FastAPI API.\r\n\r\nThe goal with this is to keep track of what is left to migrate and what is already migrated. There are a lot of endpoints and this will prevent maintainers from searching over the code base to get that information. The advantage of a decorator over docstring or comment is that it's code. (searchable by references, consistent in style, etc...).\r\n\r\nKind ask to contributors and reviewers of PR related to `AIP-84` please enforce the usage of this marker on PRs migrating endpoints

to: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42159\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to get the endpoint we need. This add the `get_dags` endpoint in the public part of the fastapi API. This is iso functional in terms of feature as to what we have on the current public api. Only difference is that permissions are not yet handled we would need https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42019.\r\n\r\nAlso I removed for now the `field` param allowing for partial response of only subfields. This is a bit harder to handle and changes dynamically the response model of the endpoint. Also this does not improve much because the full object is already loaded by the ORM, we just save some serialization and response size. (endpoint is paginated anyway). We can work on that if we need it.\r\n\r\nA follow up PR will come to add new features to that endpoint as requested in the related issue to fulfill UI requirements.","created_at":"2024-09-12T12:46:46Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T20:36:41Z","closed_at":"2024-09-13T15:04:43Z","merged_at":"2024-09-13T15:04:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d5f2bad082425d0457e3f94e6119f739f3e9892","assignee":{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7208146185,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABraOVCQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/airflow3.0:breaking","name":"airflow3.0:breaking","color":"7E4DF8","default":false,"description":"Candidates
