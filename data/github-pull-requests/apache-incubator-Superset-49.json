SUMMARY\r\nPR #21163 introduced support for time grains to the base axis for both regular and adhoc columns. This caused a performance regression that executes a query to the analytical database for every adhoc column to check if it's a temporal expression or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic slightly so that the query is executed only if needed, i.e. the base column is adhoc and has a time grain, or if the adhoc column is part of an adhoc filter. To review the PR, please use \"Hide whitespace\" to see the real changes more clearly.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nOn a chart with two normal adhoc columns, the query now executes in 7 seconds with only a single query being sent to the database:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/227862791-fec19a17-b73d-4261-bfbd-aff45e251207.png)\r\n\r\nThe same chart previously executed in 22 seconds (rougly 3 x 7 seconds with 3 queries sent to the database):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/227862961-df4811dc-dd90-4151-adb4-0d1ce657fda8.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. create a chart with multiple adhoc columns\r\n2. look at debug logs and notice an additional query being sent to the database for each adhoc column added\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen exporting to Excel, currently datatypes are not specified, leading to decimal numbers being stored as strings, which may lead to issues when opening the file.\r\n\r\nDepending on the locale, the issue may not even be visible, Excel managing to convert things. (that's the case in us/en locale). When using another locale (say fr), then numbers, output with '.' as decimal separator and stored as strings won't be usable as numbers in Excel.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to use the same \"datatype guessing\" method already existing, and use it to convert dataframe columns types when required before exporting.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nnot applicable\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n- Create a Table dashboard with numercical and decimal numbers in it. Ideally add some strings and dates.\r\n- Export to Excel\r\n- you can then unzip the .xlsx file, and open sheet1.xml in a text editor to check the export\r\n- Numbers appear directly in xml cell reference\r\n- Strings are not visible directly, instead a `<s>` markup is used containing an id to the string\r\n\r\nEditing the sheet1.xml file is the safest way to check the issue, due to magical operations softwares like Excel, LibreOffice Calc or others perform when opening files that may hide the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSee the linked issue for a description of how this can affect a Superset user.\r\n\r\nExecuting a pivot for with `drop_missing_columns=False` and lots of resulting columns can increase the postprocessing time by seconds or even minutes for large datasets. The main culprit is `df.drop(...)` operation in the for loop. We can refactor this slightly, without any change to the results, and push down the postprocessing time to seconds instead of minutes for large datasets (thousands or millions of columns).\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nLuckily, this feature is already covered by unit tests.\r\n\r\n**Manual test to see performance improvement:**\r\n\r\n1. Explore the example dataset `cleaned_sales_data`\r\n2. Add multiple dimensions (e.g. `contact_first_name, contact_last_name, phone`)\r\n3. Add any metric\r\n4. Select the `Time-series Line Chart`\r\n5. Click on \"Update Chart\"\r\n\r\n**Results on this branch**\r\nChart loads within a few seconds\r\n\r\n**Negative results (e.g. on `master`)**\r\nChart will time out or take a very long time\r\n\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/23464\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15975 - keeps the workaround and its tests, just changes the implementation very slightly.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-23T05:22:18Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T20:26:11Z","closed_at":"2023-03-24T05:53:35Z","merged_at":"2023-03-24T05:53:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"be2eb3157c9d4d86ea335e299ecbcd7409a146ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up the discussion of #23257,\r\nthis commit introduces the redux-toolkit as a prerequisite for rdk(redux toolkit) query.\r\n\r\nIn order to consolidate the multiple state management solution, superset team decided to leverage the redux with toolkit in order to organize the existing redux state.\r\nRedux toolkit also includes the rdk query package which can replace the existing react-query hooks (which is a similar solution to minimize the state of async api request) with a single solution.\r\n\r\nThis commit also use the configureStore method of the @reduxjs/toolkit package, which replaces createStore since Redux Toolkit is our (redux official channel) recommended approach for writing Redux logic today, including store setup, reducers, data fetching, and more.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit merged, we can replace existing react-query by rdk-query too. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nCharts that support drill by: all Echarts, World Map, Table, Pivot Table.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements right-click context menu with drill by option for charts that support the feature. When user right-click on series, the chart plugin constructs a filter object (similar to drill to detail filter), which in the result chart will be appended to original chart's adhoc filters. Then, user can select a column from drill by submenu that later will be used as a dimension of the result chart.\r\nThe columns are fetched when user opens the context menu. The result is cached, so that the request is not repeated for charts that use the same dataset. Only columns that are marked as dimensions in the dataset and are not used as dimensions of current chart can be selected.\r\nIf there are more than 10 available columns, a search input in the submenu is displayed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"605\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/226898828-caa9a7ee-32bb-4f01-b4c7-477ed6df4361.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

some commands from the releasing readme into makefile commands and then create a quick read guide for iterating through releases. I find that when you're in the middle of a release, that it's easy to skip steps because you're starting in the middle of the process and inevitably don't start again from the beginning. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nYou won't be able to test this in an ephemeral, but if you pull down the branch, you should be able to run the makefiles as described in original readme. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd a method `get_catalog_names` to the base DB engine spec, and implement it in Postgres as a reference.\r\n\r\nThis supports https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22862. Right now it's not used anywhere, but it's needed in order to implement a hook for generating catalog-level permissions.\r\n\r\nNext step is implementing `get_catalog_names` in more DB engine specs:\r\n\r\n- BigQuery\r\n- Drill\r\n- Snowflake\r\n- Trino\r\n- ?\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it's only possible to bypass the chart data cache by adding the `force=true` query param if a chart cache has been defined. This can be problematic if one wants to either\r\n1) disable caching globally by default, but make it possible to enable caching per database, dataset or chart\r\n1) disable caching by default for a specific database, dataset or chart without disabling chart data caching globally\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for a `-1` chart data timeout which is interpreted similarly to `force=true`, and is implemented both in the V1 chart data endpoint and `viz.py`. A test is also added to the chart data test suite. Note that the timeout value `0` is already reserved and ambiguous, and its behavior is different depending on the cache backend: sometimes is means \"never expire\", and other times \"expire instantly\" (I was not able to find a documentation reference to this, but I remember seeing it in the Flask-Caching source code while working on something else).\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nBy setting the cache timeout to -1 the cache is bypassed similar to what happens if making the request with `force=true`:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/226584610-d396b7f7-91f2-458c-b359-491002283494.mp4\r\n\r\nNote, that the value is still persisted in the cache if a cache is defined. This is to ensure that Global Async Queries will still work, and that other chart data requests that don't want to bypass the cache are able to retrieve the cached data (if available).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously it was not possible to disable the cache if `CHART_DATA_CACHE` was defined (at a minimum, it was possible to set it to 1 second, which almost did the same):\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/226584059-1025f392-e0d8-4f83-aad4-feda1852c193.mp4\r\n\r\nIn addition, if the \"cache timeout\" value was removed in the dataset modal, it would get saved as an empty string, which caused a 500 in the backend when trying to reopen the modal (it expects either a`null` or a number). To make sure that doesn't happen, we change the value to `null` if the value is an empty string when the dataset is saved.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"512\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/226585690-29ef01f3-7fb9-4e8c-a7ec-76d7e5cc4d09.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Set the chart, dataset, database or global cache config timeout to -1\r\n2. Go to a chart and click \"Update\" repeatedly\r\n3. Notice that the cache is always bypassed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe latest ClickHouse driver comes with its own DB engine spec for Superset, which breaks the dropdown for selecting a database because the key in the select option is no longer unique. I fixed this by adding using the option index as the key, as well as renaming the Superset DB engine spec to \"ClickHouse Connect (Superset)\" to differentiate from the native DB engine spec.\r\n\r\nIn the future we should probably consider removing our ClickHouse Connect DB engine spec.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-20 at 12 05 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/226440904-b23bcb34-7c93-4195-adbf-d30091ef297e.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"529\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-20 at 12 02 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/226440406-92677f9b-703b-4630-9aa5-9f4123d301be.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

how to change/create secret key.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen you are running an instance of superset naturally you might have added many DataBase connections, created a lot of charts and dashboards.\r\nSuddenly if you want to change the SECRET_KEY to make your data encrypted , you need current secret key that has already encrypted your data.\r\nThen you need to create a new SECRET_KEY\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### BEFORE

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe'd like to use this feature from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20114 for the use case where someone doesn't have user impersonation on for the database, but still wants to create different cache keys in Superset for each user. I believe that some users prefer to use their database for RLS, but this will enable them to use the Superset RLS instead. \r\n\r\nI thought about adapting with the existing key, but I didn't want to change any functionality, so instead I created a new key `CACHE_QUERY_BY_USER` \r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWith the `CACHE_QUERY_BY_USER` flag on, run a query with two different users, with different superset rls permissions and you should get different cached results. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe've been seeing sporadic non-reproducible `ForeignKeyViolation` errors in our logs when users try to delete charts:\r\n\r\n```\r\npsycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation: update or delete on table \"slices\" violates foreign key constraint \"slice_user_slice_id_fkey\" on table \"slice_user\"\r\nDETAIL:  Key (id)=(68) is still referenced from table \"slice_user\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd datasets:\r\n\r\n```\r\npsycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation: update or delete on table \"tables\" violates foreign key constraint \"sqlatable_user_table_id_fkey\" on table \"sqlatable_user\" \r\nDETAIL:  Key (id)=(18) is still referenced from table \"sqlatable_user\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Looking at the docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/cascades.html) this shouldn't happen for secondary associations, though other people have [reported the same problem](https://stackoverflow.com/q/72223166/807118). In order to fix it I changed the delete commands to manually clear the `owners` attribute, and also added an `ondelete` clause so that the database handles the cascade (in addition to SQLAlchemy).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

`arm64` arch\r\nThis PR provides `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` flag in UI layer that ensures that this stage is build once and reuse at the second layer even if we do a multi-arch build. It's `Cross-Compilation` image building\r\n\r\nUseful Article - https://www.docker.com/blog/faster-multi-platform-builds-dockerfile-cross-compilation-guide/\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29536522/225893063-506b4ca0-1850-43f0-87af-05647ce7533f.png)\r\n_**Blue contains x86 binaries, yellow ARM binaries.**_\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR\r\n\r\n- updates `messages.pot` file and derived language dependent `*.po` files (generated via `./scripts/babel_update.sh`)\r\n- adds missing German translations to the

They could be generated in the build process and probably should not be checked in anyway.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nBuilds on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23385. Renames the `adjust_database_uri` method to `adjust_engine_params` and makes it accept `connect_args` as well, so we can implement dynamic schema in Postgres. In addition, the method also takes an optional catalog, so in the future we can implement [proper catalog support](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22862).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, when using Postgres the SQL Lab schema dropdown is not used to run the query. Note that in the example below `information_schema` is selected, but the query actually runs in the `public` schema:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 15-23-18 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/225766619-cd3f658b-74b1-4ff9-b2a1-1f779e689cb2.png)\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 15-23-34 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/225766658-780270b1-a5de-490e-a125-0ce0ba0aeea9.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the search was conducted using the \"Dynamically search all filter values\" in FilterBar, the original options got lost and the Select component was selecting all values as a consequence.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by keeping the initial data in state and merging it with the new options as they are added.\r\n\r\n###

In FilterBar add a new filter with the \"Dynamically search all filter values\" \r\n2. Write a new value\r\n3. Select the value\r\n4.

tooltip sorting, the forecastValue will be recombined into an object of Record<string, ForecastValue>type, and the order of this object is uncertain, which is hashed by key, so the sorting is invalid\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50657209/225587797-f63fab25-acc5-417b-b401-4b01291bb314.png)\r\nI tried to replace the Record type with an ordered array, and then the

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the ECharts area chart sorts series in ascending order based on the series name. This is different from the NVD3 plugin, which always places the biggest series on the bottom (this applies to the bar chart as well). This PR adds the possibility to sort by not only the series name, but also the min, max, total and average series values, along with making the sort order switchable. To achieve parity with the NVD3 plugin, we change the default behavior to sort by the sum in descending order, essentially placing the largest series on the bottom. Also, to make sure the tooltip is ordered more intuitively, we reorder the tooltip labels in reverse order when stacking to place the first element (=the lowest series) last.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the series are ordered from largest to smallest, similarly to how the NVD3 plugin does it. Also notice the order of items on the tooltip, which is in line with the series on the chart:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/225552941-b8db6eaa-5f84-4b36-b84d-b3113a82431a.png)\r\n\r\nThe new controls render in real time:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/225553804-3c0a4cfa-f451-4082-9635-ada77481f527.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the series were always ordered based on the series name. Also notice that \"other\" is placed after \"TX\" due to case sensitive ordering, and that the order is reversed on the tooltip:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/225553147-91b0a0cd-7e9e-4e22-a40a-65f2554f3792.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23228 removed `show_native_filters` from dashboards, but it can still be present in exports from older versions. When the key is present, the dashboard is imported correctly, but can't be updated because the schema of `json_metadata` is now invalid.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the problem by removing the field on dashboard import. Additionally, for those dashboards that have already been imported with the field, it relaxes the metadata schema to allow updates when `show_native_filters` is present, removing it before processing the metadata.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI'm unclear if https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20799 ever stored the correct URL in the database, but it seems like the `query.tracking_url` column is not updated with the transformed URL when the record is persisted to the database.\r\n\r\nAlthough the unit tests illustrate the getter/setter behavior (and thus the link in SQL Lab works) it doesn't include a database write and thus it's unclear if SQLAlchemy invokes the getter when serializing a record to the database. Typically the getter should simply return the value whereas the setter should perform the necessary augmentation which is the logic I've implemented here, i.e., the `_tracking_url` column always contains the correct transformed value (if appropriate) whereas previous only the `tracking_url` field (proxy) was correct.\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI. Also tested locally and confirmed that the `tracking_url` which was persisted in the database was correct.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSuperset supports permissions for schema-level access control; for example, a given user role might have access to only the schema `foo` in a given database. The problem is that **it's really hard to figure out the schema of an unqualified table name**. Eg, for the following query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM bar;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a given user runs the query above, Superset needs to know what is the schema where table `bar` lives, so that it can check if the user has permission to access that schema. But **figuring out the schema is not trivial, and depends on the database engine spec and how the database configured**.\r\n\r\nFor example, for Postgres the schema will usually be `public`, the default one, [regardless of the schema selected in SQL Lab](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23356). But it's possible to specify a different search path when creating the database, eg:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nengine = create_engine(\"postgres://...\", connect_args={\"options\": \"-csearch_path=secret\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a database configured as above, the schema for the table `bar` in the query would be `secret`, and not `public`. To make things worse, the search path in Postgres can point to multiple schemas, in which case Superset has no idea where the data is coming from!\r\n\r\nOther databases can specify the default schema in the SQLAlchemy URI; MySQL is one of them (though it calls it a \"database\"):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql://user:password@host/schema\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case we can fetch the default schema for unqualified table names from the URI.\r\n\r\nFinally, some database engine specs (like Trino, Presto, Snowflake, MySQL) can modify the schema dynamically on a per-query basis, in which case we can simply use the schema that is selected in the dropdown in SQL Lab:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/870bf6d0b9a9d4feaceac1544bd9eda71b803db5/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L303-L316\r\n\r\nTo improve the situation this PR introduces a new method to DB engine specs, `get_default_schema_for_query`, along a couple helper methods. This method allows the security manager to know in which default schema a given query is running, so it can validate access to unqualified table names.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe `dataset()` macro in SQL Lab doesn't work correctly when the SQL mutator wraps the query in comments. For example, with the following mutator:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef mutator(sql: str) -> str:\r\n    return f\"-- begin\\n{sql}\\n-- end\"   \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the macro:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM {{ dataset(1) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated SQL looks like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM (-- begin\r\nSELECT ...\r\n-- end) AS dataset_1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich strips out the `) AS dataset_1` part, rendering the query invalid since it now misses a closing parenthesis.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user created a Echarts Bar chart and set the same \"X-Axis sort by\" (`x_axis_sort`) and \"Sort by\" (`timeseries_limit_metric`), and that metric was also used in the main metrics array, the `metrics` array in the query would contain duplicate metrics, which resulted in an error.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it removes duplicate labels from \"X-Axis sort by\" options.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nOnce a value is selected in `Select`, the `Select All` option should be disabled. This is because the `Select` supports the `Enter` key, and it is very likely for that to be pressed twice. Once a value is selected using `Enter`, and `Enter` is pressed twice, then instead of 1 value all values(`Select All`) gets selected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen a user runs a query in SQL Lab referencing a table without an explicit schema, we check permissions using the **query schema**. For most databases this will allow users to query schemas that they shouldn't have access to. This happens because the SQLAlchemy connection is never changed to have the query schema set as the default schema in which the query runs; for these databases, we should check permissions using the **default database schema** instead.\r\n\r\nIn this example with Postgres, a user has access to only the `secret` schema. They select the `secret` schema in SQL Lab and run the following query:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-03-13 at 5 52 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/224864561-bc6e6e49-d28c-4915-b070-031dc5515d33.png)\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM ab_user\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe database will run the query against the default schema, `public`, returning data. Superset will check if the user has access to the `secret` schema instead, allowing the query to run and returning results to the user:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-03-13 at 5 40 40 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/224863179-9b89a81d-d9e5-44fa-926b-719cef7a04ab.png)\r\n\r\nWith this fix the user is restricted:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-03-13 at 5 52 10 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/224864477-9bad7809-ea64-451c-8a41-6713faebcadf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Add a schema called `secret` to a database.\r\n1. Create a role called `secret` that has the permission `[schema access on [PostgreSQL].[secret]]`.\r\n1. Add a test user with roles `sql_lab` and `secret`.\r\n1. As the test user, select the `secret` schema in SQL Lab and run `SELECT * FROM ab_user`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user tried to use cross filtering on time shifted series, the cross filtering would take the time shift as a value rather than the series name. For example if user applied 1 year time shift on \"gender\" series and then applied cross filter on series \"1 year ago, boy\", it would emit filter `where gender in ['1 year ago']` instead of `where gender in ['boy']`.\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour by removing time shifted series names from label map\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1720\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/224701835-9b65c1ca-81f6-4a9f-b40b-51fdda7a7ac7.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1723\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/224701717-abc7f3e4-f6d4-4df0-9955-e369230c4ad0.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a timeseries chart (for example Echarts Line chart with temporal x axis), add a groupby column, add a time shift\r\n2. Add the chart to a dashboard and click on time shifted series to emit a cross filter\r\n3. Verify that the emitted filter is correct\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nAdd 'urlParams' option to pass query parameters to embedded dashboard(for SQL templating)\r\n\r\nThere are 2 representative cases it can handle:\r\n1. General Case: Passes all query parameters on main page. In this case, 'dashboardConfig' and 'filterConfigUrlParams' can be affected by query parameters on main page.\r\n2. Special Case: If 'urlParams' specified on dashboardUiConfig option, passes explicit query parameters in 'urlParams' only. So 'dashboardConfig' and 'filterConfigUrlParams' cannot be affected by query parameters on main page, and it can restrict query parameters only necessary for Superset Dashboard. In addition, It can replace an existing embedded dashboard to a new one using updated query parameters - An embedded dashboard will be recreated when UI values change on parent page and they should be applied to the embedded dashboard.\r\n\r\nMy website provides datepicker UI component on parent page. If its value changes, Replace an embedded dashboard(used old value) to a new one(used new value). As far as I know, Destroying the old one and Creating a new one is the best. I tried refresh embedded dashboard by the message channel between the main page and iframe - it's complex\r\n\r\nI'm using like the example below. \r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  var embedded_dashboard;\r\n  \r\n  var init = function () {\r\n      embedded_dashboard && embedded_dashboard.unmount();  // Destroy existing dashboard\r\n      \r\n      // Replace with a new one\r\n      supersetEmbeddedSdk.embedDashboard({\r\n          // ...\r\n          dashboardUiConfig: {\r\n              urlParams: {\r\n                  foo: 'new_val_1',\r\n                  bar: 'new_val_2',\r\n                  // ...\r\n              },\r\n          },\r\n      })\r\n          .then(switchboard => {\r\n              embedded_dashboard = switchboard; \r\n          });\r\n

SUMMARY\r\nWhen querying datasets with \"TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE\" in Firefox or Safari, Table chart is unable to format the timestamp. This is due to the fact that Trino returns the value in string format that is not ISO-8601 compliant, which causes Firefox and Safari to fail to parse the value. This can be confirmed by trying to create a `Date` object in the browser debugging console with the timestamp value returned by Trino:\r\n\r\nChrome:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224633626-684b5423-ede9-4412-9980-3ee7d82ddda2.png)\r\n\r\nSafari:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224639312-c7e1df7d-4e94-4908-acac-f02d406a395d.png)\r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224633729-61ff96a4-e598-4da7-8e15-d5b87cf13d41.png)\r\n\r\nNotice how all three browsers are able to parse the value if the space is replaced with a \"T\" and the timezone is replaced with \"Z\" (Superset assumes all timestamps to be in \"Zulu time\" aka UTC timezone).\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that \"almost ISO-8601\" timestamps are always normalized into proper ISO format, and any timezone info is converted into UTC. When/if we run into other funny timestamp formats we can add logic to handle them in this util to make sure they render correctly.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the timestamp with timezone displays correctly in Safari (notice the raw value returned by the query in the \"Results\" tab):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224632432-fa4ad26d-37fe-4c96-9be4-0194f75d77c2.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the timestamp would fail to render in Safari:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224633001-2b9382d4-51f5-484c-bb1f-02cd61ba08d3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Query a dataset on Trino that returns \"TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE\" without a timegrain\r\n2.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe [patch](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22358) breaks some folks functionality around report schedule for draft dashboard, permalink. This PR should:\r\n1. bring back access check from security manager when getting dashboard by id_or_slug.\r\n2. don't apply Dashboard base filter if it's getting by uuid.\r\n3. dashboard create permalink should use the uuid. This allows whoever has permalink to be able to access dashboard after access check from security manager.\r\n4. update report execution to use the dashboard uuid link rather than the int link.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
