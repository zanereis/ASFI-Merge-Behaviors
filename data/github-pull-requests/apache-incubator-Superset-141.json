SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe functional part of this PR makes the timestamp expression a native SQLAlchemy element that respects quoting rules for column names (based largely on https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/compiler.html) . This is a continuation of what was started in #6897, which was really just a hack to make `Postgres` work, but didn't address e.g. reserved keywords or similar problems that might arise in other dbs. This PR adds a new class `TimestampExpression`, which can be used in a SQLAlchemy query, which keeps the target column as a native Core element. The column name is only rendered to text once the query is compiled, which ensures that engine specific quoting rules are respected.\r\n\r\nRefactoring:\r\n\r\n- Added mypy typing where code was changed.\r\n- Moved some functional parts of `sqla/models/get_timestamp_expression()` to `db_engine_specs/get_timestamp_expr()`.\r\n- Removed `models/core/grains()` which was no longer needed.\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\nAdded unit tests that test the central features and tested timeseries graphs using both column and expression, both with and without time grains.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration. Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n    [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n    [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n    [x] Fixes bug\r\n    [x] Refactors code\r\n    [x] Adds test(s)\r\n\r\n##### REVIEWERS\r\nComments much appreciated @betodealmeida @john-bodley. Also @agrawaldevesh: I had to change the Pinot logic for this PR. Do you have the opportunity to test if this works on your Pinot deployment (I don't have a Pinot installation handy right now)? I also added a few grains while at it, do they work?\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T17:17:46Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:18:01Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T05:28:37Z","merged_at":"2019-05-30T05:28:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"34407e896296a7a98a3bc31bde20ae1f3ac02005","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":238899552,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg4OTk1NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/enhancement:request","name":"enhancement:request","color":"4FCDCE","default":false,"description":"Enhancement

noticed a number of anomalies in our database caused by ill-defined forms and/or table schema definitions. This PR resolves a number of issues related to the `slices` table including:\r\n\r\n- Ensures that the `datasource_id` column is not-NULL.\r\n- Ensures that the `datasource_name` column is not-NULL.\r\n- Ensures that the `datasource_type` column is non-NULL. \r\n\r\nLong terms we should look at trying to deprecate the denormalized `datasource_name` column which can (and should) be inferred from the (`datasource_id`, `datasource_type`) tuple. I believe the reason for its existence is mostly legacy however it may be required for importing/exporting of slices where one must identify entities by name rather than ID.  \r\n\r\nNote this migration _will_ fail if the `slices.datasource_id`, `slices.datasource_name`, or `slices.datasource_type` column is NULL. One **must** manually fix these records as programmatically trying to remedy these invalid records is difficult as it may not be apparent what the corresponding datasource should be given the possibly lack of information. The following query determines which records are problematic:\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n    * \r\nFROM \r\n    slices\r\nWHERE \r\n    datasource_id IS NULL OR \r\n    datasource_name IS NULL OR \r\n    datasource_type IS NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote this PR is gated by https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5445 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7084 which ensure that empty strings associated with form-data wont persist in the database and is necessary for ensuring that the relevant entries are non-NULL.\r\n\r\nto: @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @mistercrunch

PR adds a new api endpoint `superset/available_domains/` which simply returns the value of the `config` variable `SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_DOMAINS`. \r\n\r\n`SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_DOMAINS` allows a Superset deployment to use domain sharding to effectively increase the number of parallel data requests and improve dashboard loading times. When embedding Superset charts in other applications, developers may want to use a similar technique to improve data loading times. However without exposing the available domains through an endpoint, the developers would have to duplicate / hard-code the domains in their app which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nTested the endpoint locally.\r\n\r\n@kristw @conglei @xtinec @soboko @mistercrunch \r\ncc @graceguo-supercat @john-bodley

want color consistency so that when users revisit dashboards, colors remain the same for metrics.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we follow a general algorithm to assign colors to metrics but it can lead to inconsistency. The user first picks a color scheme. Then we iterate through the list of data values and assign a color to it in a sequential manner. The color assignments are stored for the current session. If more values are added, we continue down the list of colors that are part of the scheme. If a user removes a value, all the other values keep their color association because we have stored this information. When the user saves the chart or dashboard, we do not save the color assignments. Thus when the user revisits the chart or dashboard, the color assignments may change because it iterates through the values displayed in the chart or dashboard and re-assigns their colors again. This can cause some confusion when users revisit their visualizations.\r\n\r\nThis PR enforces color consistency in dashboards so that when users revisit dashboards, the same colors are applied to metrics on each visit. Note that this will not apply until the owner edits his or her dashboard and selects/saves a color scheme.\r\n\r\nI am putting out a PR while I add unit tests.","created_at":"2019-03-21T23:15:54Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T01:05:04Z","closed_at":"2019-03-27T01:05:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ae3041e789d3c2bc8e70d05fe052816a5e02ef5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/7086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/7086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/c38ab70fe043287604e285709ab478916c414cf8","head":{"label":"lyft:VIZ-335","ref":"VIZ-335","sha":"c38ab70fe043287604e285709ab478916c414cf8","user":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108907301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg5MDczMDE=","name":"incubator-superset","full_name":"lyft/incubator-superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyft/incubator-superset","description":"Lyft

PR resolves a couple of issues related to either a chart or dashboard name being `None`. Prior to https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5445 these fields were encoded as empty strings and thus certain issues didn't surface. \r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5445 it is impossible to filter by either dashboard or chart in which the name (title) is undefined as there is no mechanism to filter either in/out `NULL` values. Furthermore sorting by either chart of dashboard name isn't viable due to an issue with Flask-AppBuilder as mentioned in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/3673. On the flip side when empty strings were allowed it was possible to filter these entities however itwas not possible to navigate to said entity from the CRUD view as there was no link present.\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally renames undefined names to `<empty>` in the CRUD view as this is consistent with both the Dashboard and Explorer views. \r\n\r\n**Charts**\r\n<img width=\"241\"

the CRUD views the cluster/database and datasource/table are required in the forms to ensure that either an added or edited entity is correctly assigned to the parent.

The only viable solution I am aware of is simply to make the fields read-only per the suggestion outlined

In order for this to happen however erroneous records need to be removed and ill-defined records need to be mutated.\r\n\r\nErroneous records are defined when:\r\n\r\n- A Druid or SQLAlchemy column name _and_ column expression does not exist.\r\n- A Druid or SQLAlchemy metric name _and_ metric expression does not exist. \r\n\r\nIll-defined records are defined when: \r\n\r\n- A Druid datasource or SQLAlchemy table name does not exist. \r\n- A Druid or SQLAlchemy column name does not exist however there is a column expression defined. \r\n- A Druid or SQLAlchemy metric name _xor_ metric expression exists.\r\n\r\nGiven that the CRUD model is broken with NULL values the migration mutates the relevant fields to contain the `migration_40f150716b13_` prefix. This allows the admin to then provide a cleanup pass if required to remove or update the violating records.\r\n\r\nto: @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @mistercrunch @xtinec

`PostgresEngineSpec` have the default implementation of the `convert_dttm` method that follows the `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` date time format. Despite the fact that the particular format is supported by PostgreSQL, it is not ISO8601 compliant, see section [4.3.2](http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf). The standard permits to omit the time designator `T`, but does not imply permission to replace it with a whitespace.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would be harder to use Superset with databases that support the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol and strictly follow ISO8601.

PR adds `mypy` (courtesy of `flake8`) for checking Python type hints. Additionally it updates the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to strongly encourage new Python functions to use type hints.\r\n\r\nNote I corrected some `mypy` issues but ignored others as I don't have full context into the code. The `get_since_until` method seems to be especially problematic partially because `since`, `until`, and `relative_end` are being re-typed in the function (which is probably non-ideal). \r\n\r\nto:

Fixed searching the visual components with case-insensitive key on \"Select a visualization type\" window.\r\n\r\n- [‚úîÔ∏è] I have checked the superset logs for python stack traces and included it here as text if there are any.\r\n- [‚úîÔ∏è] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.\r\n- [‚úîÔ∏è] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Superset version\r\n0.29\r\n\r\n### Expected results\r\nVisual components list should be filtered with case-insensitive search key on \"Select a visualization type\" window.\r\n\r\n### Actual results\r\nVisual components list not getting filtered with case-insensitive search key on \"Select a visualization type\" window.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nOpen Visualization Type list, and then filter Visualization components list with search key, enter search string in lower case, it will get filtered but when search string is entered in upper case or Camel case, the list is not getting filtered.

reproduce this bug: \r\n\r\n1. Edit dashboard\r\n\r\n2. Add a newly created slice, and make sure slice had a title (when slice is recently created from sql_lab -> explore view, in slice's params, it doesn't have slice_id param)\r\n\r\n3. Save dashboard\r\n\r\n4. Go to explore from newly-added slice, slice title displays as \"untitled\"\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nwhen slice_id is not in query parameter, Superset just run the query, but doesn't have slice related

PR removes the check when saving a datasource via the React component of whether said user is an owner (according to the rubric specified [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/3ae02d1a542ed66522f6a0a51433490e7da9ea30/superset/views/base.py#L326)). reverting to using FAB `@has_api_access` decorator checking the `can_save` permission. \r\n\r\nThis ensures that the behavior is consistent with the datasource CRUD views (`DruidDatasourceModelView` and `TableModelView`) which also do not explicitly check the ownership but rather rely on the equivalent FAB `can_edit` permission.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that the CRUD views may be deprecated in the future and that the permission model may change, but fundamentally datasources differ from other entities in Superset (charts and dashboards) and debating ownership models should occur in a future forum. For now this PR ensures that there is consistency between the various mechanisms around editing/saving datasource metadata.\r\n\r\nto: @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @mistercrunch

is a small PR that does a lot. It changes the initial request for charts (in explore or dashboards) to be done through a `GET` request, greatly improving the loading speed of dashboards. It also moves the caching to the HTTP layer, allowing us to benefit from `Expires` and `ETag` headers for conditional requests.\r\n\r\n# The problem\r\n\r\nThis diagram compares the current flow (\"before\") with the one implemented by this PR (\"after\"):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"512\" alt=\"Cache\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/54342019-1543dc00-4644-11e9-90ea-76862a31e505.png\">\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\nLet's assume Superset is configured with a **1 hour cache**, and also that the data changes on a longer period (daily, eg):\r\n\r\n1. User \"A\" requests a chart from Superset doing a `POST` request with the payload.\r\n2. Superset computes the query and sends it to the DB.\r\n3. DB returns a dataframe.\r\n4. Superset caches the dataframe.\r\n5. Superset serializes the payload and sends it back to user \"A\".\r\n6. User \"A\" refreshes the dashboard.\r\n7. Superset finds the dataframe cached.\r\n8. Superset serializes the payload and send it back to user \"A\".\r\n9. Superset cache expires after 1 hour.\r\n10. User \"A\" refreshes the dashboard.\r\n11. Superset computes the query and sends it to the DB.\r\n12. DB returns the exact same dataframe.\r\n13. Superset caches the dataframe again.\r\n14. Superset serializes the payload and sends it back to user \"A\".\r\n\r\nThere are a few inefficiencies here:\r\n\r\n- The browser cache is never used, because it's doing `POST` requests.\r\n- Superset needs to serialize the payload even on a cache hit.\r\n- Data is transferred to the browser even if it hasn't changed.\r\n\r\n## After\r\n\r\n1. User \"A\" requests a chart from Superset **doing a `GET` request with the chart id**.\r\n2. Superset computes the query and sends it to the DB.\r\n3. DB returns a dataframe.\r\n4. Superset serializes the dataframe and **caches the HTTP response**.\r\n5. Superset sends the payload to user \"A\", with an `Expires` header of 1 hour, and an `ETag` header which is a hash of the payload.\r\n6. The browser stores the response in its native cache, and `SupersetClient` caches it also in the [Cache interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache).\r\n7. The user refreshes the dashboard.\r\n8. Because of the `Expires` header and the use of `GET` the **data is read directly from the native browser cache**.\r\n9. Superset cache expires after 1 hour.\r\n10. User \"A\" refreshes the dashboard. The **native cache is not used, since `Expires` is now in the past**. `SupersetClient` looks for a cached response in the Cache interface, and if one is found, extracts its `ETag`.\r\n11. The **browser requests the chart with an `If-None-Match` header**, containing the hash of the cached response (its `ETag`).\r\n12. Superset computes the query and sends it to the DB.\r\n13. DB returns the exact same dataframe.\r\n14. Superset serializes the dataframe and **caches the HTTP response**.\r\n15. Superset sees that the `ETag` matches the `If-None-Match` header, returning a `304 Not Modified` response.\r\n16. Browser fetches the cached response from the Cache interface.\r\n17. Browser uses the response.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- The `GET` request is done only the first time the chart is mounted. Forcing refresh on dashboards and clicking \"Run Query\" in the Explore views perform `POST` requests, which bypass the cache, and cache the new response. I tested the Explore view and dashboards with filters, and all further interactions are done with `POST`s.\r\n\r\n- Since we're caching the HTTP response, we need to verify that the user has permission to read the cached response. This is done by passing a `check_perms` function to the decorator that caches the responses.\r\n\r\n- The [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) has no support for conditional responses with ETags. We need to add explicit support in `SupersetClient`. I have a separate PR for that (see https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/119).\r\n\r\n- **There is one small downside to this approach**. During the time while `Expires` is still valid, the browser will not perform any requests for cached charts unless the user explicitly refreshes a dashboard or click \"Run Query\" in the Explore view. If the data is bad, they will see bad data until it expires or they purposefully refresh the chart. In the current workflow, in theory we can purge the cache in this case, since it lives only on the server-side. This is a hypothetical scenario, and we could workaround it by sending a notification to dashboards that one or more charts have bad data and should be refreshed.","created_at":"2019-03-14T05:00:27Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:17:16Z","closed_at":"2019-04-03T19:11:09Z","merged_at":"2019-04-03T19:11:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"538776b47025f8ff97f293f943736cb3633b2702","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xtinec","id":1521435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjE0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1521435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec","html_url":"https://github.com/xtinec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xtinec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":238899552,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg4OTk1NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/enhancement:request","name":"enhancement:request","color":"4FCDCE","default":false,"description":"Enhancement

branch from which the code is branched is 0.30 (v0.30.0rc12). This because since 0.31 onwards, the Druid models seems to be broken (see #6780). So not sure what would be the path to merge into master.\r\n\r\nThe PyDruid requirement has been changed to reflect inclusion of Registered Lookup class as in [Registered lookups #153](https://github.com/druid-io/pydruid/pull/153)\r\n\r\nAlso there is quite a bit of code for issuing the Druid query, (e.g. using \"Phase 1\" and \"Phase 2\" queries).

PR remedies a couple of issues related to Hive/Presto partitions. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. For Hive there was no check to see whether the Pandas Dataframe was empty and thus an exception was raised when trying to obtain the `_latest_partition_from_df`. For context this same issue was resolved for Presto in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/2740.\r\n\r\n2. Added a check that if the partition value is explicitly `None` to ensure that the query isn't mutated to include a non-valid `WHERE` clause. The methods simply return `False` (which is somewhat of a strange return value) which is consistent with other invalid scenarios. \r\n\r\nNote for (1) this wasn't an issue for [`where_latest_partition`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs.py#L1325) as the exception was caught, however it was problematic for the `extra_table_metadata` which is used in SQL Lab for fetching the preview. \r\n\r\nto: @michellethomas @mistercrunch
