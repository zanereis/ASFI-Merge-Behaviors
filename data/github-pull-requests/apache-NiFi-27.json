Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11365](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11365) Corrects OpenID Connect Redirect URI resolution for NiFi deployments running behind a reverse proxy server.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11363) Corrects handling of double precision numbers in flow encryption commands including `encrypt-config.sh`, `set-sensitive-properties-key`, and `set-sensitive-properties-algorithm`.\r\n\r\nThe JSON parsing process used a method to return a Java `float` value when encountering the JSON `VALUE_NUMBER_FLOAT` type, which resulted in loss of precision under certain circumstances, such as position coordinates for Processors.\r\n\r\nThe correction returns the parsed value as a string and uses the `writeRawValue()` method to avoid any number conversion while processing values.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\nHave a command registry export-all-flows that does the following:\r\nList all the buckets, for each bucket, list all flows, for each flow, list all versions and export each version. All files should be landing in a target directory provided as an argument of the function.\r\n\r\nHave a command registry import-all-flows that does the following:\r\nIt takes a directory as input (the one created by the export-all-flows command), and goes through the files to create the corresponding buckets, flows and flows versions.\r\nThe original author, bucket id and flow id need to be kept.\r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\nuse case 1: NiFi 1 -> connecting to NiFi Registry 1, \"re-initialising\" an existing NiFi Registry, the NiFi Registry does not change, only its configuration.\r\nexport everything\r\nchange the NR flow definition repo backend from local FS to database (for example), or from git to database, etc\r\nimport everything\r\nthe existing NiFi instance should not see any change\r\nuse case 2: NiFi 1 -> Registry 1, NiFi 2 -> Registry 2, Disaster Recovery kind of thing between two different sites.\r\nexport everything from NR1\r\nimport everything into NR2\r\nIf the import into NR2 is adding new versions, then NiFi 2 should be able to update an existing PG to a newer version of the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11345](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11345) Adjusts `TestPutIcebergWithHiveCatalog` to reduce the total running time from over 60 seconds to around 20 seconds. The Iceberg module is one of the slowest extension modules for unit tests due to this test class. Instead of running the same test method for all three supported formats (Avro, ORC, and Parquet), the changes use a single format for a single method. This ensures the same basic test behavior while exercising each format across different test methods.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11337](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11337) This PR removes the`dependsOn` from the definition of the Maximum Batch Size property as the dependency is not honored in the code. The documentation is updated to reflect the actual behavior, and the default value is changed to 1000 to avoid memory usage issues for large incoming FlowFiles.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11325) Upgrades Mockito from 3.12.4 to [4.11.0](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v4.11.0) and updates deprecated references to current methods.\r\n\r\n[Mockito 4](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v4.0.0) provides the current baseline version for Java 8, which works for both the NiFi current main branch and the support branch.

test was broken. My understaning is that the test supposed to ensure that classes from outside the allowed NAR directory should not be loaded expect if they are part of a spefic set of classes (java or jdk \"modules\"). The original configuration of the test used the \"target\" folder as NAR folder, which contained every product of the build, including the class \"org.apache.nifi.stateless.bootstrap.RunStatelessFlow\" used as test subject, thus the class was loaded and the test broke. I narrowed down the \"nar folder\" in order to not have the test subject included, this I would believe solves the issue.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11319](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11319)\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11316](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11316) Removes the `nifi-toolkit-admin` module with associated administrative commands. The NiFi CLI provides node management commands and other functions, serving as a unified replacement for some elements of the Admin Toolkit. Other configuration migration features are not relevant to NiFi 2.0, and new migration features will require a different approach.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11281) Corrects the scope of `accumulo-core` in for the Processors NAR and Services NAR modules under `nifi-accumulo-bundle`. Setting the scope to `provided` allows the Accumulo NAR modules to use `accumulo-core` from `nifi-accumulo-services-api-nar` and eliminates over 70 MB from each of the dependent NAR files.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11277) Deprecates `bcrypt` and `scrypt` Sensitive Properties Algorithms along with variants using key lengths of 128 bits.\r\n\r\nThe deprecation warnings leave the following two options as recommended and targeted for support in NiFi 2.0:\r\n\r\n- NIFI_ARGON2_AES_GCM_256\r\n- NIFI_PBKDF2_AES_GCM_256\r\n\r\nThe Administrator's Guide includes updates to reflect this recommendation along with the deprecated algorithms. The `NIFI_ARGON2_AES_GCM_256` option has been available since NiFi 1.12.0 and the `NIFI_PBKDF2_AES_GCM_256` has been the default setting since NiFi 1.14.0.\r\n\r\nReducing the available options to these algorithms provides clearer recommendations for supported options, reducing complexity for both configuration and maintenance in future versions.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11261](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11261) Adds Primary Node State Change handling to `GetAzureEventHub` to improve Processor behavior in a clustered deployment.\r\n\r\nAlthough `ConsumeAzureEventHub` provides the recommend approach for receiving events, `GetAzureEventHub` can be configured to run on the cluster primary node only to reduce the potential for duplication.\r\n\r\nUpdates include checking for the Execution Node status and avoiding unnecessary Event Hub Consumer Client creation. The new handler method for Primary Node State changes closes the Consumer Client when a node has its primary status revoked, and creates a new Consumer Client when a node is elected primary.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include upgrading the Qpid Proton J dependency from 0.34.0 to [0.34.1](https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-j-0.34.1/release-notes.html) and setting the Consumer Client Identifier to the Processor Identifier for improved connection tracking.\r\n\r\nNew unit test methods provide basic confirmation of Processor behavior when configured for primary node execution.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11257) Updates the Maven Wagon HTTP configuration for GitHub automated builds to enable connection pooling with additional retries.\r\n\r\nEarlier Maven configurations disabled HTTP connection pooling attempting to improve stability, but more recent versions of Maven Wagon support a number of [HTTP configuration options](https://maven.apache.org/wagon/wagon-providers/wagon-http/).\r\n\r\nThe configuration updates switch to the default setting of HTTP connection pooling enabled, but set a time-to-live of 30 seconds for pooled connections. The configuration lowers the maximum connections per route from the default of 20 to 5, in order to reduce the number of simultaneous connections to the Maven Central repository.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include setting the number of retry attempts to 5, instead of the default of 3, and using the [StandardHttpRequestRetryHandler](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/current/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/impl/client/StandardHttpRequestRetryHandler.html).\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-4890](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4890) Refactors the NiFi OpenID Connect integration using Spring Security 5 with support for extended application sessions using [Refresh Tokens](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.5).\r\n\r\nThe new implementation replaces custom REST Resources with Spring Security filters to maintain existing support for the [Authorization Code Grant Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowSteps). The new implementation also maintains support for [OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html) when the OpenID Connect Provider supports ending sessions.\r\n\r\nAs part of supporting session continuation with Refresh Tokens, the new implementation supports [OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7009). The updated Administrator's Guide documentation describes the Refresh Token handling. As noted in the documentation, application use of Refresh Tokens is conditional on the Authorization Server returning a Refresh Token during authentication. OIDC support follows the same pattern as other authentication strategies when the Authorization Server does not provide a Refresh Token.\r\n\r\nThe implementation introduces a new property named `nifi.security.user.oidc.token.refresh.window` to control the duration of time between when the application Bearer Token expires and when the application should attempt to renew access using the Refresh Token.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

processor to grant flowfile v3 to have mime precedence over internal file contents\r\n\r\nPriority was raised to \"70\" to handle .wmv files (see [NIFI-11166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11166) for similar issue.  wmv files have priority of \"60\" [1], so this needed to be higher)\r\n\r\nUnit tests were expanded to cover new mime type (xhtml) mentioned in jira ticket.\r\nLooked to cover wmv as well, but when looking for free samples, most hosting websites had limits on their terms of use which causes complications.\r\n\r\nThe best I could find were the four top wmv files here: https://www.appsloveworld.com/sample-wmv-video-file-free-download\r\n\r\nThese are wmv trailer adaptations of the [Durian Open Movie Project](https://durian.blender.org/about/)\r\n© copyright Blender Foundation | [durian.blender.org](https://durian.blender.org/)\r\n\r\nThis is under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license [2]\r\nso we are allowed to have it to our machines.\r\n\r\nStill unclear about wrapping it into a github commit for apache nifi, though, but it can be tested as follows:\r\n\r\nSet up flow:\r\nGetFile -> MergeContent -> IdentifyMimeType -> funnel\r\n\r\nwhere GetFile is getting a .wmv video file.\r\n\r\nMergeContent should have\r\nMerge Format as \"FlowFile Stream, v3\"\r\n\r\nVerify output flowfile has mime.type of\r\napplication/flowfile-v3\r\nas opposed to\r\nvideo/x-ms-wmv\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]https://github.com/apache/tika/blob/2.7.0/tika-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/tika/mime/tika-mimetypes.xml#L7889\r\n[2]
