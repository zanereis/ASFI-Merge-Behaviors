While it might be a suitable implementation for some use-cases, some users might create assets with a more recurrent frequency needed, leading to additional load to the DB which can cause slowness, timeouts, etc. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two configs that can be specified in `superset_config.py`:\r\n``` python\r\n# Set a minimum interval threshold between executions (for each Alert/Report)\r\n# Value should be the amount of minutes (integer). Min: 1, Max: 60\r\nALERT_MINIMUM_INTERVAL_MINUTES = None\r\nREPORT_MINIMUM_INTERVAL_MINUTES = None\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis minimum interval is validated for both creation of new reports and also the modification of existing ones.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR doesn't include a migration, so changing this config won't automatically change existing reports.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nBoth integration and unit tests added. For manual testing:\r\n1. Specify a minimum interval in config:\r\n``` python\r\nALERT_MINIMUM_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 2\r\nREPORT_MINIMUM_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 2\r\n```\r\n2. Try creating a report/alert that exceeds this limit.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB

accessibility support in Apache/Superset through enhanced a11y features, such as generating [aria-label with Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/best-practices/aria/), is crucial for ensuring inclusivity and usability for all users, including those with disabilities. \r\n\r\nBy adhering to [WCAG guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Use_of_color) and making adjustments to colors and patterns as required, we not only enhance the user experience for individuals with disabilities but also align with standards for accessibility, promoting a more inclusive and equitable platform for all users.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n        aria: {\r\n          enabled: true,\r\n          decal: {\r\n            show: true,\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1672\"

SUMMARY\r\nSmall refactor on `CSVImportCommand` and `ExcelImportCommand` to DRY and make it more easily extendable and maintainable.\r\n\r\nUsing dependency injection on a generic `UploadCommand` of `BaseReaders` that will be able to read a certain type of file.\r\nPandas lib is able to read from multiple file types, CSV, HTML, Excel, XML, Latex, Feather, SAS XPORT etc. So with this refactor it will be much simpler and clean to add support for new file types.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR fixes the following bugs on reader options:\r\n- `overrite_duplicates`: was an existing option that wasn't actually implemented, removed since I found no option for it on pandas `read_csv`\r\n- `decimal`: was not actually implemented\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if

positions via sidebar.js (no more manual reshuffling of files)\r\n- Split Installation and Configuration apart, giving a focused approach for each topic.\r\n- Create a new topic called \"Using Superset\" which will focus on day-to-day usage (creating dashboards, charts, using tags, creating reports and alerts).\r\n- Renaming of previous topics to simpler names while renaming files for better organization.\r\n- Setting up the option of \"hideable\" sidebars.\r\n\r\nMultiple links have been broken due to renaming of files and new directories, bulk of commits were done in order to fix

change related to [[SIP-99B] Proposal for (re)defining a \"unit of work\"](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25108), I'm in the process of creating some PRs to clean up some unnecessary/problematic logic to aid with future testing/debugging.\r\n\r\nSpecifically it seems like at times we're overly pushing an application context where, per the [documentation](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/contexts/#tests), it states:\r\n\r\n> Only push a context exactly where and for how long it‚Äôs needed for each test. Do not push an application context globally for every test, as that can interfere with how the session is cleaned up.\r\n\r\nThis is likely the cause of a number of issues I was running into with expired objects in the session not being refreshed. \r\n\r\nFinally this PR removes all `db.session.expire_all()` statements which are not needed. Per my previous statement, these _likely_ were added due to some inconsistencies with how the session was being managed during testing. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nRuff is great, and it's fast. All the cool kids are using it. \r\n\r\n\r\n#edit -putting my latest comment as PR body:\r\n\r\nThis PR is meant as an experiment around whether it would make sense to add this package as part of the stack. I'll try and summarize my findings and recommendation after playing with it. \r\n\r\nrelevant: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/\r\n\r\nEarly impression are:\r\n\r\n#### on the positive:\r\n- super fast and centralized in a comprehensive CLI (pretty much fully replaces pycln, pyupgrade, isort, black)\r\n- simplifying the code quality stack quite a bit. Many of those tools themselves are adopting `ruff` (pylint uses in its repo for instance). There's fair amount of cognitive load in dealing with disjointed tools with their own cli, config and quirks.\r\n- powerful / convenient features like `--add-no-qa` `--ignore-noqa` and `--fix`\r\n- it's taking over the python code-quality world fast, federating everything in a nifty, comprehensive toolkit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### on the negative:\r\n- while it covers at lot, it's intricately incomplete, pylint is the less covered source where it cannot replace it fully at this time, for the others, it seems like ruff is \"enough of a replacement\" to justify rip & replace - here I'm thinking disabling duplicate rules with pylint might speed pylint sifnificantly\r\n- I hit some infinite linting loops and deadends in some area, pushing me to disable black, isort and pyupgrade. Our codebase is large, and while ruff is 99% compatible with all this, 1% is still a significant thing\r\n- this won't replace pylint as the coverage is still too low and pylint is powerful. I was thinking we may be able to disable rules in pylint that are covered and speed it up in the process\r\n\r\nOverall I think the recommendation is likely to be \"we should do this now\" or \"we should probably revisit in a little while\", will update here once I form an opinion.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-20T01:09:07Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:44:00Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T00:19:53Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T00:19:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d63722150840f93291f3678016f51d94ee72c77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

follow up to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28117, which sadly wasn't suffice when variables as opposed to constants were being used with the `format()` Jinja macro.\r\n\r\nSadly the `as_const()` method has only been implemented for a subset of node types and given that the plethora of logic which one could define is vast it's likely best to just acknowledge there are times when we wont be able to accurately extract the table referenced by the `latest[_sub]_partition` Jinja macro.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nBumps sqlparse to 0.5.0 to address a potencial vulnerability. \r\n\r\nFollowup from: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28042\r\n\r\nDon't think we will have breaking changes here, I think that our upper bound was a cautions bound following semantic versioning for 0.X.X versions.\r\n\r\nChangelog: https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/blob/master/CHANGELOG\r\n```\r\nNotable Changes\r\n\r\n* Drop support for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.\r\n* Python 3.12 is now supported (pr725, by hugovk).\r\n* IMPORTANT: Fixes a potential denial of service attack (DOS) due to recursion\r\n  error for deeply nested statements. Instead of recursion error a generic\r\n  SQLParseError is raised. See the security advisory for details:\r\n  https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-2m57-hf25-phgg\r\n  The vulnerability was discovered by @uriyay-jfrog. Thanks for reporting!\r\n\r\nEnhancements:\r\n\r\n* Splitting statements now allows to remove the semicolon at the end.\r\n  Some database backends love statements without semicolon (issue742).\r\n* Support TypedLiterals in get_parameters (pr649, by Khrol).\r\n* Improve splitting of Transact SQL when using GO keyword (issue762).\r\n* Support for some JSON operators (issue682).\r\n* Improve formatting of statements containing JSON operators (issue542).\r\n* Support for BigQuery and Snowflake keywords (pr699, by griffatrasgo).\r\n* Support parsing of OVER clause (issue701, pr768 by r33s3n6).\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Ignore dunder attributes when creating Tokens (issue672).\r\n* Allow operators to precede dollar-quoted strings (issue763).\r\n* Fix parsing of nested order clauses (issue745, pr746 by john-bodley).\r\n* Thread-safe initialization of Lexer class (issue730).\r\n* Classify TRUNCATE as DDL and GRANT/REVOKE as DCL keywords (based on pr719\r\n  by josuc1, thanks for bringing this up!).\r\n* Fix parsing of PRIMARY KEY (issue740).\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

contains a secret key (much like we set a SECRET_KEY up for flask on the python side). In normal operation, the administrator needs to provide such a file by copying and altering `superset-websocket/config.example.json`.\r\n\r\nFor `docker-compose`, now that we're 100% clear in our docs and files that our provided setup should not be used for production, we want to provide a dummy config file so that the service can start, as opposed to the confusion of starting a service that crashes upon start and spits a wall of confusing JSON.\r\n\r\nNote that I've also:\r\n- improved the error message for when the secret is too simple\r\n- copied the example file into `docker/superset-websocket/config.json`\r\n- altered the password with a dummy secret\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-18T23:25:19Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:44:12Z","closed_at":"2024-04-23T18:06:41Z","merged_at":"2024-04-23T18:06:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"063914af04bf293d1c24e0c26b22d5aabd731d29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently there's some irrelevant DEBUG-level type logging happening when using the CLI, here I'm doing the following things:\r\n- setting the default logging level to INFO, which is the normal/sane default usually used in software\r\n- downgrading unimportant messages in the console from INFO to DEBUG\r\n- adding a dash of color on the title (bolded-white) and config loading INFO (cyan)\r\n- turning off load limiter `RATELIMIT_ENABLED` to `False` when not in a `production` environment (added a note to `UPDATING.md` for that)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<img width=\"1173\"

and its ability to render entity relationship diagrams (and other various UML) defined as code. Originally started as a PoC one-off, but it's looking pretty good and could be added to our doc builds.\r\n\r\nI wanted to visualize the ERD, and thought it'd be a great asset for contributors to be able to refer to it.\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n- I wrote a script that introspects the models in Superset\r\n  and use jinja2 to render a `erd.plantuml`, and a `erd.svg`\r\n- Adding a interactive

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new endpoint to get metadata from a table, optionally passing a schema and a catalog.\r\n\r\nIn order to support the new endpoint, this PR has two refactors. Despite touching many files, they are simple:\r\n\r\n1. All methods that take a `table_name` and a `schema` were updated to received a `Table` instance instead, since it carries the catalog:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/69a7bfc88d7aac3cb08cb45376be1699a67ebee0/superset/sql_parse.py#L242-L250\r\n\r\n2. All other methods that take a `schema` now also take a `catalog`.\r\n\r\nNote that currently the catalog being passed around is always `None`. It gets passed all the way to the `adjust_engine_params` method in the DB engine spec, and DB engine specs are responsible for modifying the SQLAlchemy URI to connect to the catalog.\r\n\r\nIn the next PR I'll start implementing support for catalogs in Postgres, and will modify the UI to allow choosing a catalog when running SQL or creating a dataset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests for the new endpoint, and updated existing tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nThis DRAFT PR attempts to refactor the current documentation structure by doing the following things:\r\n- Create a custom Docusaurus sidebar for handling docs positions and overall organization.\r\n- Split Installation and Configuration apart, giving a focused approach for each topic.\r\n- Create a new topic called \"Using Superset\" which will focus on day-to-day usage (creating dashboards, charts, using tags, creating reports and alerts).\r\n- Renaming of previous topics to simpler names.\r\n- Setting up the option of \"hideable\" sidebars.\r\n\r\nSince there are changes within the document structure, there's a few broken links, will fix them before being ready to review.","created_at":"2024-04-18T11:43:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T17:24:20Z","closed_at":"2024-04-20T04:52:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"261fd5ffa9b8ca8114cf67183503683e3e6e6746","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

either a Jinja filter or Python `str` function to dynamically define the table referenced by the `latest[_sub]_partition` macros. Cases like `trino.latest_partition(\"foo.%s\"|format(\"bar\"))` and `trino.latest_partition(\"foo.{}\".format(\"bar\"))` resulted in errors of the form, \r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'Filter' object has no attribute 'value'\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'Call' object has no attribute 'value'\r\n```\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nI went through numerous rabbit holes to try to have the Jinja environment render the AST subtree in a generic way, but alas I wasn't able find an elegant solution‚Äîespecially when it comes to the `Call` node.\r\n\r\nThe fix‚Äîwhich only works for the `Filter` node‚Äîis to use the `as_const()` method as opposed to the `value` attribute to ensure the filter is rendered. Note that one can always rewrite the `str.format` using the Jinja `format()` filter.\r\n \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPrior to the enablement of the generic chart x-axis, the relevant ECharts charts included the \"Time-series\" prefix whereas several of the deprecated NVD3 charts didn't:\r\n\r\n<img

\"Time-series\" prefix was correctly dropped from the ECharts charts (to reflect their more general form),\r\n\r\n<img width=\"430\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 8 54 04‚ÄØAM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/d65407a2-c414-47bc-a3d4-750f4dc62fdc\">\r\n\r\nhowever this resulted in a somewhat of a convoluted UX, i.e., the legacy NVD3 charts _only_ work when the x-axis is a time-series (temporal) and thus I thought the names should be updated to reflect this.\r\n\r\nThis PR renames the following NVD3 chart types:\r\n\r\n- Area Chart (legacy) ‚Üí Time-series Area Chart (legacy)\r\n- Line Chart (legacy) ‚Üí Time-series Line Chart (legacy)\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the the legacy NVD3 temporal bar chart was already named appropriately given it needed to distinguish itself from the legacy NVD3 non-temporal bar chart. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"433\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 2 54 41‚ÄØPM\"

will still exist even though the don't include the `Time-series` prefix. I looked into updating these via Google Translate, but I'm not entirely sure how accurate they are.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"434\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds user impersonation support for the StarRocks database by leveraging the native `EXECUTE AS {user} WITH NO REVERT` user management query.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. If necessary create a separate user on your StarRocks DB and your Superset instance. The names must match and it should be different from the user that is used for the StarRocks connection itself\r\n2. Enable the user impersonation feature in the security settings of your StarRocks database\r\n3. Log in to Superset with your testing user\r\n4. Execute `SELECT CURRENT_USER();` and see that it shows your current Superset user\r\n5. Disable user impersonation feature again\r\n6. Execute `SELECT CURRENT_USER();` again and see that it changed back to the user of the StarRocks connection\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n[supersetbot](https://github.com/apache-superset/supersetbot/) has a feature where it will add labels to all PRs that are getting release either since the last release, or as a cherry.

Note that I'm generalizing `docker-release.yml` to be `release.yml` too here.\r\n\r\nThis way it's easy to track, for any give PR:\r\n- whether it's part of any release\r\n- which release was the

SUMMARY\r\nContinuing the work on deprecating/removing server side rendered pages, this adds a new React/Antd Form and backend API for Excel uploads.\r\n\r\nLeverages the work already done here: #27840\r\n\r\nImportant to note that, we continue to offer a file preview functionality done on the browser. On the CSV case we load a limited initial chunk of the file and infer the column names from there. This time we have to load the entire Excel file, this unfortunately blocks the browser while loading on big files.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to immediately upload the file to the backend to a new API that would return all existing sheets and columns from the Excel file.\r\n\r\nThere are pros and cons on each approach, processing the file on the browser avoids uploading and processing the file twice on the server. Doing an initial upload offers a better user experience on big files.\r\n\r\nI've added a switch so that users can opt out of the preview. Users can still manually insert column names and sheet names.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4025227/c1e88eac-34a3-4131-9af7-717512f0aecc\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR AN\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Currently this asset happens to be on the site's LFS branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset-site/tree/lfs\r\n\r\nASF gives us not only a prod site, but a staging site we've never taken advantage of. This PR points the ASF's staging server at the LFS branch. These files should get copied/hosted at our staging URL: https://superset.staged.apache.org/\r\n\r\nThen we can link to that ASF hosted file rather than GitHub or Githubusercontent in a subsequent PR, and remove the CSP entries.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

href=\"https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/releases\">react-dnd's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v16.0.0</h2>\n<h2>Major</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Packages are now ESM-Only (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c</a>)</li>\n<li>Node 18 Support</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v15.1.2</h2>\n<p>The utility packages <code>@react-dnd/invariant</code>, <code>@react-dnd/shallowequal</code>, and <code>@react-dnd/asap</code> (which are forks of popular libraries) have been included in the monorepo and built using the same output mechanisms as the <code>react-dnd</code> core packages (dual EJS/CSM).</p>\n<p><code>@react-dnd/asap</code> has been simplified to remove the node variant, which relied on deprecated APIs</p>\n<h2>v15.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All packages now have verified ESM support</li>\n<li>Packages expose CJS/ESM surface are via <code>pkg.exports</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v15.0.2</h2>\n<p>This release uses output from swc using the 'es2017' target instead of using output from 'tsc' using the 'ESNext' target.</p>\n<h2>v15.0.1</h2>\n<p>This release fixes issues with the ESM-only structure of v15.0.0. All packages are now in their prior CommonJS/ESM format.</p>\n<h2>v15.0.0</h2>\n<h2>Major Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><del>The react-dnd packages are now published as ESM-only with <code>type: module</code>. See this FAQ by sindresorhus: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c</a></del></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Decorators API has been removed and fully replaced by the Hooks API. The Decorators API was difficult to develop &amp; type correctly, and this improves its maintainability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The builds no longer use babel &amp; preset-env. The library is transpiled using SWC into the &quot;es2017&quot; target, which assumes async/await is available. This should reduce bundle sizes by removing polyfills and support-code which may be unnecessary in your target.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve data-transfer acquisition from File inputs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3262\">#3262</a>)</li>\n<li>Don't set the 'draggable' attribute unless <code>canDrag</code> is true (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3187\">#3187</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve typings of DropTargetMonitor, DragLayerMonitor (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3300\">#3300</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3341\">#3341</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v14.0.3</h2>\n<h2>Updated</h2>\n<p>react-dnd: 14.0.3\nreact-dnd-html5-backend: 14.0.1\nreact-dnd-touch-backend: 14.1.0</p>\n<h2>Patch Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix drop operations in iframes &amp; child windows (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3181\">#3181</a>) (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/eramdam\"><code>@‚Äãeramdam</code></a>!)</li>\n<li>Refactor TouchBackend OptionsReader (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3291\">#3291</a>)</li>\n<li>Cleanup connected DOM elements from react-dnd internals when hook-based components unmount (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3290\">#3290</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix issue where custom drag-sources where triggering native drops in Firefox (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3272\">#3272</a>) (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/istateside\"><code>@‚Äãistateside</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v14.0.2</h2>\n<h3>Patch</h3>\n<p>This PR will throw a developer exception if a user specifies a <code>useDrag::spec.begin</code> method.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI started working on [SIP-95](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22862), which introduces catalogs to Superset. The introduction of a new hierarchical level, catalog ‚Üí schema ‚Üí table, means that some API endpoints need to be updated to support a new parameter.\r\n\r\nOne of these API endpoints is used to fetch extra metadata about a given table, and the route looks like this:\r\n\r\n`/<int:pk>/table_extra/<path:table_name>/<schema_name>/`\r\n\r\nThere are a few problems with the current route:\r\n\r\n- `table_name` is a `path`, because table names can contain slashes.\r\n- `schema_name` is often passed as `null` or `undefined`, so we need special logic to convert it to `None` in the backend.\r\n- `schema_name` should never contain slashes, otherwise the parsing will be wrong.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, instead of enhancing the existing endpoint to add support for catalogs, I decided to create a new one:\r\n\r\n`/<int:pk>/table_metadata/extra/?table=t[&schema=s[&catalog=c]]`\r\n\r\nIn this new endpoint, `table`, `schema`, and `catalog` are all passed as query parameters. This allows slashes in all of them, and prevents polluting logs with confusing URLs such as `/api/v1/databses/1/table_extra/my_table/undefined/`. Only `table` is required, the other two are optional.\r\n\r\nThe API calls a new method `get_extra_table_metadata` in the corresponding DB engine spec. The new method takes a `Table` object, which contains a name and optional schema/catalog. To prevent breaking any 3rd-party DB engine specs the new method will issue a warning and call `extra_table_metadata` if it exists and no catalog was specified.\r\n\r\nNote that while the old endpoint is not removed in this PR, to prevent breaking changes, the frontend code was updated to use the new endpoint.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we should remove the old endpoint and also the `extra_table_metadata` method. @michael-s-molina, what do you think of this approach of introducing a new API? Should we mark it as deprecated now and remove it in the next release, or should we mark is as deprecated in 5.0 and remove it in 6.0?\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26138 removed the link from the \"Edit chart\" menu item on dashboards to enhance accessibility but it caused the chart to open in a new window. The goal of this PR is to support opening the chart in the same window by default while still allowing for opening a chart in a separate window with `cmd + click`.\r\n\r\nIt also removes an `onBlur` handler that was causing the interruption of some menu item actions by closing the dropdown abruptly. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Click on \"Edit chart\" in a Dashboard\r\n2. The chart should open in the same window\r\n3. cmd + click, the chart should open in a new window\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval

reported here https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/28026, in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27953 I added support for a supplemental `docker/.env-local` override file, not thinking it was going to be required upon starting docker-compose. I thought I had tested that while switching branches but somehow didn't test that docker-compose would simply boot up in the absence of that file.\r\n\r\nBUT! luckily there's a new feature as of docker-compose `2.24.0` where there's a way to specify required and not-required files here, so I'm taking advantage of that in this correction PR. Kudos to @artofcomputing for finding this new feature and for pointing this out!\r\n\r\nI also added a bit of documentation to point to an existing mechanism around providing a `docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config_docker.py` file, which existed in the logic but wasn't clearly documented. This\r\nsolves for my use case where I was working a PR adding features around Slack, where I wanted to provide an API key configuration without risks of commiting/pushing it back to the repo.\r\n\r\ncloses

SUMMARY\r\nPreviously when the value of a BigNumber was zero (falsey) the expression to evaluate colors always got evaluated to false. Meaning that if my condition was `number <= 50` and my number was 0, it wouldn't color it. It would work if it was `0.1`.\r\n\r\nRelated to this issue: #21820\r\nMost recent discussion around this PR #23064\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Tested if colors when BigNumber is zero\r\n- Tested if still works for negative, floats, and scientific notation numbers like `1e-100`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n1. fixes a use of f-strings in sql_parse.py which causes pybabel to error. (See https://github.com/python-babel/babel/issues/715 for why.)\r\n2. reorders the translation messages within the translation files by simply running the commands described in https://superset.apache.org/docs/contributing/translations/ which otherwise would have lead to large merge conflicts even for small translation changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not include any changes to the translations themselves.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWhen extracting the messages from using the [documented pybabel commands](https://superset.apache.org/docs/contributing/translations/), without any translation changes, the message.pot file should not change (except for the license information).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

been keeping an eye on our CI and noticed that a couple of Python tests like `test_query_cache_key_changes_when_datasource_is_updated` and `test_chart_data_async` keep tripping up on MySQL. I think it might be the different isolation levels messing things up compared to PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\nSo, I've tweaked our MySQL setup in the GitHub Actions to use 'READ-COMMITTED', just like Postgres.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere was some discussion in Town Hall about whether or not we should use feature flags for runtime configuration or not. The jury is still out! No matter where they live, I figured that at least for now, we should split these up by intent. Then it's clearer to users whether these \"stable\" flags are ones that will remain (for now, anyway) as config, vs the ones that will march toward feature release and flag deprecation.\r\n\r\nIf this makes sense as a small intermediary step, let me know if I've miscategorized any of them :)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe `get_sqla_engine_with_context` method in the database model is a context manager, and because of that it has the unneeded `_with_context` suffix. This PR renames it to simply `get_sqla_engine`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ for file in `git grep -l get_sqla_engine_with_context`\r\n> do sed -ie 's/get_sqla_engine_with_context/get_sqla_engine/' $file\r\n> done\r\n```\r\n\r\nI left a `get_sqla_engine_with_context` method that simply points to `get_sqla_engine`, to prevent breaking any 3rd party tools, even though this is not a public interface.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
