Therefore we abandon the long running worker architecture, simply call commit() or abort() and exit the worker and allow spark to reuse worker for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently we run long running python worker process for python streaming source and sink to perform planning, commit and abort in driver side. Testing indicate that current implementation cause connection timeout error when streaming query has large trigger interval.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Note: support for complex types will be added separately.\r\n\r\n- Logical plan is rewritten in analysis to replace non-binary strings with `CollationKey`\r\n- `CollationKey` is a unary expression that transforms `StringType` to `BinaryType`\r\n- Collation keys allow correct & efficient string comparison under specific collation rules\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove GROUP BY performance for collated strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- E2e SQL tests for `RewriteGroupByCollation` in `CollationSuite`\r\n- Various queries with GROUP BY in existing TPCDS collation test suite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-17T13:04:39Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T11:14:12Z","closed_at":"2024-06-27T11:14:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dde955afc7f2f6adcb99552f515f93eee8799a44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [this previous PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46012), we introduced two new confs for the introduced plan cache - a static conf `spark.connect.session.planCache.maxSize` and a dynamic conf `spark.connect.session.planCache.enabled`. The plan cache is enabled by default with size 5. In this PR, we are marking them as internal because we don't expect users to deal with it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese two confs are not expected to be used under normal circumstances, and we don't need to document them on the Spark Configuration reference page.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-17T11:23:10Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T20:06:41Z","closed_at":"2024-05-17T20:06:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a2187ba8b813295a16ad09e78f76b42eaf7fae0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7fa96d5e1890f257f7ae098b130f522320448f8","head":{"label":"xi-db:SPARK-47818-plan-cache-followup2","ref":"SPARK-47818-plan-cache-followup2","sha":"a7fa96d5e1890f257f7ae098b130f522320448f8","user":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":757362931,"node_id":"R_kgDOLSRw8w","name":"spark","full_name":"xi-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db/spark","description":"Apache

and Spark Classic,\r\n\r\ne.g. in Spark Classic\r\n```\r\nIn [9]: spark.range(10).select(sf.lit(1).alias(\"key\"), \"id\").groupBy(\"key\").agg(sf.max(\"id\")).schema.json()\r\nOut[9]:

make it worse is that internal metadata maybe leaked in different cases of Spark Connect and Spark Classic, so need to add additional `_drop_meta` in Pandas APIs to make assertions work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, the internal metadata will be dropped in `DataFrame.schema`, e.g. the `__autoGeneratedAlias` in the example

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add `external third-party ecosystem access` guide to the `scala/java` doc.\r\n\r\nThe external third-party ecosystem is very extensive. Currently, the document covers two scenarios:\r\n- Pure java (for example, an application only uses the java language - many of our internal production applications are like this)\r\n- java + scala\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide instructions for external third-party ecosystem access to the structured log framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, When an external third-party ecosystem wants to access the structured log framework, developers can get help through this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT.\r\n- Manually test.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-17T07:28:50Z","updated_at":"2024-05-25T16:43:04Z","closed_at":"2024-05-25T16:43:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04ab8839e7ef71fbc23ab50434af37422c238d33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7180df06fc47990b4f7b49345f19c82ae676b1a","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-48320","ref":"SPARK-48320","sha":"a7180df06fc47990b4f7b49345f19c82ae676b1a","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFiles don't need to be cached for reuse in `FileStreamSource` when using `Trigger.AvailableNow` because all files are already cached for the lifetime of the query in `allFilesForTriggerAvailableNow`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44924 (with a PR to address https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45362), the hard coded cap of 10k files being cached can cause problems when using a maxFilesPerTrigger > 10k. It causes every other batch to be 10k files, which can greatly limit the throughput of a new streaming trying to catch up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nEvery other streaming batch won't be 10k files if using Trigger.AvailableNow and maxFilesPerTrigger greater than 10k.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a consumer modifies the result values of a cached property it will modify the value of the cached

In our production environment, it is configured as 2 If the first execution fails, AM will retry. However, in some scenarios, even attempting a second task may fail.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\norg. apache. park. SQL AnalysisException: Table or view not found: test.testxxxx_xxxxx; Line 1 pos 14;\r\nProject\r\n+-Unresolved Relationship [bigdata_qa, testxxxxx_xxxxx], [], false\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther example:\r\nCaused by: org. apache. hadoop. hdfs. protocol NSQuotaExceededException: The NameSpace quota (directories and files) of directory/tmp/xxx_file/xxxx is exceeded: quota=1000000 file count=1000001\r\n\r\nWould it be more appropriate to try capturing these exceptions and stopping retry?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn some scenarios, even attempting a second task may fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe user can throw a SparkStopAMRetryException, and the Application Master will catch the exception and stop retry\r\n\r\nset spark.yarn.maxAppAttempts=2\r\n\r\nFor examle\r\n\r\n```\r\nval spark = SparkSession\r\n\r\n      .builder()\r\n\r\n      .appName(\"Spark SQL basic example\")\r\n\r\n      .enableHiveSupport()\r\n\r\n      .getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n\r\n      spark.sql(\"select * from test.testxxxx_xxxxx;\").show\r\n\r\n    } catch {\r\n\r\n      case e:AnalysisException => throw new SparkStopAMRetryException(\"this is a test\", e)\r\n\r\n    } finally {\r\n\r\n      spark.stop()\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCompute the schema of the data without partition columns only once in FileSourceStrategy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn FileSourceStrategy, the schema of the data excluding partition columns is computed 2 times in a slightly different way, using an AttributeSet (`partitionSet`) and using the attributes directly (`partitionColumns`) \r\nThese don't have the exact same semantics, AttributeSet will only use expression ids for comparison while comparing with the actual attributes will use the name, type, nullability and metadata. We want to use the former here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI noticed an outdated comment in the rule `InlineCTE`\r\n```\r\n      // CTEs in SQL Commands have been inlined by `CTESubstitution` already, so it is safe to add\r\n      // WithCTE as top node here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not true anymore after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42036 . It's not a big deal as we replace not-inlined CTE relations with `Repartition` during optimization, so it doesn't matter where we put the `WithCTE` node with not-inlined CTE relations, as it will disappear eventually. But it's still better to keep it at its original place, as third-party rules may be sensitive about the plan shape.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUTs are added.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA new trait `DataSender` is added in this PR to provide a unified data sender interface for the StatsdReporter. Under this trait we have implementations for UDP mode (`UDPDataSender`, which keeps the existing UDP-based implementation) and TCP mode (`TCPDataSender`). It is configurable which mode/sender to use and the default mode is still UDP.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests are refactored to add TCP mode testing (context provided by `withSocketAndSinkTCP`) in addition to the existing tests for the UDP mode (renamed from `withSocketAndSink` to `withSocketAndSinkUDP`)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs mentioned in the Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48298\r\nCurrently, the StatsdSink in Spark supports UDP mode only, which is the default mode of StatsD. However, in real production environments, we often find that a more reliable transmission of metrics is needed to avoid metrics loss in high-traffic systems, and also provide more flexibility in network configurations.\r\n\r\nTCP mode is already supported by Statsd: https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/server.md\r\nPrometheus' statsd_exporter: https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter \r\nand also many other Statsd-based metrics proxies/receivers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\nThe following new config options are added to `conf/metrics.properties.template`:\r\n`*.sink.statsd.protocol`\r\n`*.sink.statsd.connTimeoutMs`\r\nA new error condition is defined in error-conditions.json for protocol configuration error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded/Refactored unit tests. Also manually tested with metric configurations sending metrics to a Netcat server in TCP and UDP modes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-16T03:25:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-02T00:23:29Z","closed_at":"2024-09-02T00:23:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8472cef173caaf03cbb7cb17c402e4b901da1731","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f73f2abe2e695aff9098ad81c8fffe3412e8bf23","head":{"label":"jiwen624:statsd-tcp","ref":"statsd-tcp","sha":"f73f2abe2e695aff9098ad81c8fffe3412e8bf23","user":{"login":"jiwen624","id":14141331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQxMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14141331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwen624","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":800257984,"node_id":"R_kgDOL7L3wA","name":"spark","full_name":"jiwen624/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiwen624","id":14141331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQxMzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14141331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624","html_url":"https://github.com/jiwen624","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiwen624/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiwen624/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTwo new classes `org.apache.spark.internal.Logger` and `org.apache.spark.internal.LoggerFactory` were introduced from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46301.\r\nGiven that Logger is a widely recognized **interface** in Log4j, it may lead to confusion to have a class with the same name. To avoid this and clarify its purpose within the Spark framework, I propose renaming `org.apache.spark.internal.Logger` to `org.apache.spark.internal.SparkLogger`. Similarly, to maintain consistency, `org.apache.spark.internal.LoggerFactory` should be renamed to `org.apache.spark.internal.SparkLoggerFactory`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo avoid naming confusion and clarify the java Spark logger purpose within the logging framework\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nGA tests\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request improves the Oracle JDBC tests by skipping the redundant SYSTEM password reset.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are necessary to clean up the Oracle JDBC tests. \r\n\r\nThis pull request effectively reverts the modifications introduced in [SPARK-46592](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46592) and [PR #44594](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44594), which attempted to work around the sporadic occurrence of ORA-65048 and ORA-04021 errors by setting the Oracle parameter DDL_LOCK_TIMEOUT.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [issue #35](https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-free/issues/35), setting DDL_LOCK_TIMEOUT did not resolve the issue. The root cause appears to be an Oracle bug or unwanted behavior related to the use of Pluggable Database (PDB) rather than the expected functionality of Oracle itself.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with [SPARK-48141](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48141), we have upgraded the Oracle version used in the tests to Oracle Free 23ai, version 23.4. This upgrade should help address some of the issues observed with the previous Oracle version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested using the existing test suite, with a particular focus on Oracle JDBC tests. The following steps were executed:\r\n```\r\nexport ENABLE_DOCKER_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1\r\n./build/sbt -Pdocker-integration-tests \"docker-integration-tests/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.OracleIntegrationSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-47353](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47353)\r\n\r\n#### Pull requests\r\n\r\n[Scala TreeMap (RB Tree)](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46404)\r\n[GroupMapReduce](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46526) <- Most performant\r\n[GroupMapReduce (Cleaned up) (This PR)](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46597) <- Most performant\r\n [Comparing Experimental Approaches ](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46488)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46597/files#r1626058908 -> https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46917#discussion_r1640081873\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Central Change to Mode `eval` Algorithm:\r\n - Update to `eval` Method: The `eval` method now checks if the column being looked at is string with non-default collation and if so, uses a grouping \r\n ```\r\nbuff.toSeq.groupMapReduce {\r\n         case (key: String, _) =>\r\n           CollationFactory.getCollationKey(UTF8String.fromString(key), collationId)\r\n         case (key: UTF8String, _) =>\r\n           CollationFactory.getCollationKey(key, collationId)\r\n         case (key, _) => key\r\n       }(x => x)((x, y) => (x._1, x._2 + y._2)).values\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Minor Change to Mode:\r\n- Introduction of `collationId`: A new lazy value `collationId` is computed from the `dataType` of the `child` expression, used to fetch the appropriate collation comparator when `collationEnabled` is true.\r\n\r\nThis PR will fail for complex types containing collated strings \r\nFollow up PR will implement that \r\n\r\n\r\n #### Unit Test Enhancements: Significant additions to `CollationStringExpressionsSuite` to test new functionality including:\r\n- Tests for the `Mode` function when handling strings with different collation settings.\r\n\r\n #### Benchmark Updates:\r\n- Enhanced the `CollationBenchmark` classes to include benchmarks for the new mode functionality with and without collation settings, as well as numerical types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Ensures consistency in handling string comparisons under various collation settings.\r\n2. Improves global usability by enabling compatibility with different collation standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces the following user-facing changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adds a new `collationEnabled` property to the `Mode` expression.\r\n2. Users can now specify collation settings for the `Mode` expression to customize its behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested through a combination of new and existing unit and end-to-end SQL tests.\r\n\r\n1. **Unit Tests:**\r\n   - **CollationStringExpressionsSuite:**\r\n     - Make the newly added tests more in the same design pattern as the existing tests\r\n    - Added multiple test cases to verify that the `Mode` function correctly handles strings with different collation settings.\r\n\r\nOut of scope: Special Unicode Cases higher planes\r\n\r\nTests do not need to include Null Handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Benchmark Tests:**\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package \r\nexport

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFIRST CHANGE\r\n\r\nPass correct parameter list to `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ResolveDefaultColumns#analyze` when it is invoked from `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.CatalogV2Util#structFieldToV2Column`.\r\n\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ResolveDefaultColumns#analyze` method accepts 3 parameter\r\n\r\n1) Field to analyze\r\n2) Statement type - String\r\n3) Metadata key - CURRENT_DEFAULT or EXISTS_DEFAULT\r\n\r\nMethod `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.CatalogV2Util#structFieldToV2Column`\r\npass `fieldToAnalyze` and `EXISTS_DEFAULT` as second parameter, so it is not metadata key, instead of that, it is statement type, so different expression is analyzed.\r\n\r\nPull requests where original change was introduced\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40049 - Initial commit\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44876 - Refactor that did not touch the issue\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44935 - Another refactor that did not touch the issue\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND CHANGE\r\nAdd user facing exception when default value is not foldable or resolved. Otherwise, user would see message \"You hit a bug in Spark ...\".\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is needed to pass correct value to `Column` object\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this is a bug fix, existence default value has now proper expression, but before this change, existence default value was actually current default value of column.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-05-15T09:28:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T07:09:12Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T20:08:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55da70056aebd4e5cee3e5206730c74482551aae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b9108e168fff02de382da7e98aa7f4824ca802de","head":{"label":"urosstan-db:SPARK-48286-Analyze-exists-default-expression-instead-of-current-default-expression","ref":"SPARK-48286-Analyze-exists-default-expression-instead-of-current-default-expression","sha":"b9108e168fff02de382da7e98aa7f4824ca802de","user":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":750788282,"node_id":"R_kgDOLMAeug","name":"spark","full_name":"urosstan-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString searching in UTF8_BINARY_LCASE now works on character-level, rather than on byte-level. For example: `instr(\"İ\", \"i\")`; now returns 0, because there exists no `start, len` such that `lowercase(substring(\"İ\", start, len)) == \"i\"`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix functions that give unusable results due to one-to-many case mapping when performing string search under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE (see example above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, behaviour of `instr` and `substring_index` expressions is changed for edge cases with one-to-many case mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

PR is a fix of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46437. The previous PR was reverted as `LONGTEXT` is not supported by all dialects.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpecial case escaping for MySQL and fix issues with redundant escaping for ' character.\r\nNew changes introduced in the fix include change `LONGTEXT` -> `VARCHAR(50)`, as well as fix for table naming in the tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen pushing down startsWith, endsWith and contains they are converted to LIKE. This requires addition of escape characters for these expressions. Unfortunately, MySQL uses ESCAPE '\\' syntax instead of ESCAPE '' which would cause errors when trying to push down.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests for each existing dialect.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-15T06:28:01Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T11:18:37Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T14:16:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4c6e0f1e2293aecd087ffe5c71f0624ef1930b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46588/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46588/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46588/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c20c91233c0df6f73ff0c2f6593a2135737fa65","head":{"label":"mihailom-db:SPARK-48172","ref":"SPARK-48172","sha":"1c20c91233c0df6f73ff0c2f6593a2135737fa65","user":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":756245919,"node_id":"R_kgDOLRNlnw","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailom-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday we can't create `RowEncoder` with char/varchar data type, because we believe this can't happen. Spark will turn char/varchar into string type in leaf nodes. However, advanced users can even create custom logical plans and it's hard to guarantee no char/varchar data type in the entire query plan tree. UDF return type can also be char/varchar.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds UNSUPPORTED_DATA_TYPE_FOR_ENCODER instead of throwing scala match error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter error\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, UTF8String.indexOf returns 0 when given an empty parameters string, and any integer start value. Examples:\r\n```\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", 0);  // returns: 0\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", 2);  // returns: 0\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", 9);  // returns: 0\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", -3); // returns: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not correct, as \"start\" is not taken into consideration. Correct behaviour would be:\r\n```\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", 0);  // returns: 0\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", 2);  // returns: 2\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", 9);  // returns: -1\r\n\"abc\".indexOf(\"\", -3); // returns: -1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix a bug in `indexOf` implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `indexOf` behaves differently with empty patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`PlanWithUnresolvedIdentifier` is rewritten later in analysis which causes rules like \r\n`SubstituteUnresolvedOrdinals` to miss the new plan. This causes following queries to fail:\r\n```\r\ncreate temporary view identifier('v1') as (select my_col from (values (1), (2), (1) as (my_col)) group by 1);\r\n--\r\ncache table identifier('t1') as (select my_col from (values (1), (2), (1) as (my_col)) group by 1); \r\n--\r\ncreate table identifier('t2') as (select my_col from (values (1), (2), (1) \r\nas (my_col)) group by 1);\r\ninsert into identifier('t2') select my_col from (values (3) as (my_col)) group by 1; \r\n```\r\nFix this by explicitly applying rules after plan rewrite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fix the described bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it fixes the mentioned problematic queries.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated existing `identifier-clause.sql` golden file.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday we can't create `RowEncoder` with char/varchar data type, because we believe this can't happen. Spark will turn char/varchar into string type in leaf nodes. However, advanced users can even create custom logical plans and it's hard to guarantee no char/varchar data type in the entire query plan tree.\r\n\r\nTo make it a bit more flexible, this PR supports char/varchar in `RowEncoder`, so that people can still create `Dataset` with such query plans, and it won't hurt.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto make `RowEncoder` more flexible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nPeople can now use char/varchar as UDF return type or DataFrame output schema. But it's the same as string type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to `DataFrame.checkpoint` and `DataFrame.localCheckpoint` API in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-16 at 10 39 25 AM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/6477701/c5c4754f-3d5e-4f4a-8f9d-a7218ce49320)\r\n\r\n1. Spark Connect Client invokes [local]checkpoint\r\n    - Connects to the server, store (Session UI, UUID) <> Checkpointed DataFrame\r\n2. Execute [local]checkpoint\r\n3. Returns UUID for the checkedpointed DataFrame.\r\n   - Client side holds the UUID with truncated (replaced) the protobuf message\r\n4. When the DataFrame in client side is garbage-collected, it is invoked to clear the state within Spark Connect server.\r\n5. If the checkpointed RDD is not referred anymore (e.g., not even by temp view as an example), it is cleaned by ContextCleaner (which runs separately, and periodically)\r\n6. *When the session is closed, it attempts to clear all mapped state in Spark Connect server (because it is not guaranteed to call `DataFrame.__del__` in Python upon garbage-collection)\r\n7. *If the checkpointed RDD is not referred anymore (e.g., not even by temp view as an example), it is cleaned by ContextCleaner (which runs separately, and periodically)\r\n\r\n*In 99.999% cases, the state (map<(session_id, uuid), c'p'dataframe>) will be cleared when DataFrame is garbage-collected, e.g., unless there are some crashes. Practically, Py4J also leverages to clean up their Java objects. For 0.001% cases, the 6. and 7. address them. Both steps  happen when session is closed, and session holder is released, see also [apache/spark#41580](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41580).\r\n\r\n#### Command/RPCs\r\n\r\nReuse `CachedRemoteRelation` (from [apache/spark#41580](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41580))\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nmessage Command {\r\n  oneof command_type {\r\n    ...\r\n    CheckpointCommand checkpoint_command = 14;\r\n    RemoveCachedRemoteRelationCommand remove_cached_remote_relation_command = 15;\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Command to remove `CashedRemoteRelation`\r\nmessage RemoveCachedRemoteRelationCommand {\r\n  // (Required) The remote to be related\r\n  CachedRemoteRelation relation = 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage CheckpointCommand {\r\n  // (Required) The logical plan to checkpoint.\r\n  Relation relation = 1;\r\n\r\n  // (Optional) Locally checkpoint using a local temporary\r\n  // directory in Spark Connect server (Spark Driver)\r\n  optional bool local = 2;\r\n\r\n  // (Optional) Whether to checkpoint this dataframe immediately.\r\n  optional bool eager = 3;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage CheckpointCommandResult {\r\n  // (Required) The logical plan checkpointed.\r\n  CachedRemoteRelation relation = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nmessage ExecutePlanResponse {\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  oneof response_type {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    CheckpointCommandResult checkpoint_command_result = 19;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  message Checkpoint {\r\n    // (Required) The logical plan checkpointed.\r\n    CachedRemoteRelation relation = ...;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --conf spark.checkpoint.dir=/path/to/checkpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.range(1).localCheckpoint()\r\nspark.range(1).checkpoint()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor feature parity without Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds both `DataFrame.checkpoint` and `DataFrame.localCheckpoint` API in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests, and manually tested as below:\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --remote \"local[*]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df = spark.range(1).localCheckpoint()\r\n>>> df.explain(True)\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\nLogicalRDD [id#1L], false\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nid: bigint\r\nLogicalRDD [id#1L],

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a regression test (e2e) with SPARK-47305.\r\n\r\nAs of commit cae2248bc13 (pre-Spark 4.0), the query in new unit test is represented as below logical plans:\r\n\r\n> Batch 0\r\n\r\n>> analyzed plan\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, 5067923b-e1d0-484c-914c-b111c9e60aac, Append, 0\r\n+- Project

+- LocalRelation <empty>, [value#3]\r\n      +- Project [id#12L AS ref_code#14L]\r\n         +- Range (1, 5, step=1, splits=Some(2))\r\n```\r\n\r\n>> optimized plan\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToDataSourceV2

[value#1]\r\n   +- Join Inner, (cast(code#5 as bigint) = ref_code#14L)\r\n      :- Union false, false\r\n      :  :- Project [value#1, 1 AS code#5]\r\n      :  :  +- LocalRelation <empty>,

MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n      +- Project [id#12L AS ref_code#14L]\r\n         +- Range (1, 5, step=1, splits=Some(2))\r\n```\r\n\r\n>> optimized plan\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToDataSourceV2 MicroBatchWrite[epoch: 1, writer: ...]\r\n+- Join Inner\r\n   :- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#3] MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n   +- LocalRelation <empty>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the difference in optimized plan between batch 0 and batch 1. In optimized plan for batch 1, the batch side is pruned out, which goes with the path of PruneFilters. The sequence of optimization is, \r\n\r\n1) left stream side is collapsed with empty local relation\r\n2) union is replaced with subtree for right stream side as left stream side is simply an empty local relation\r\n3) the value of 'code' column is now known to be 'null' and it's propagated to the join criteria (`null = ref_code`)\r\n4) join criteria is extracted out from join, and being pushed to the batch side\r\n5) the value of 'ref_code' column can never be null, hence the filter is optimized as `filter false`\r\n6) `filter false` triggers PruneFilters (where we fix a bug in SPARK-47305)\r\n\r\nBefore SPARK-47305, a new empty local relation was incorrectly marked as streaming.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I intentionally didn't put the detail like above as code comment, as optimization result is subject to change for Spark versions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the PR of SPARK-47305 we only added an unit test to verify the fix, but it wasn't e2e about the workload we encountered an issue. Given the complexity of QO, it'd be ideal to put an e2e reproducer (despite simplified) as regression test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was

to `StringType` in `CharVarcharUtils.replaceCharVarcharWithStringInSchema` and record `__CHAR_VARCHAR_TYPE_STRING` in the metadata.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the above error is that the `StringType` columns in the `dataSchema` and `requiredSchema` of `UnivocityParser` are not consistent. The `StringType` in the `dataSchema` has metadata, while the metadata in the `requiredSchema` is empty. We need to retain the metadata when resolving schema.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new test case in `CSVSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-14T01:47:26Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T06:26:33Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T05:38:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdd633512fa76c344bef90bb4da71ddfebae36fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/669bc27502fdeb2e09d6bf062742309debc260f8","head":{"label":"liujiayi771:branch-3.5-SPARK-48241","ref":"branch-3.5-SPARK-48241","sha":"669bc27502fdeb2e09d6bf062742309debc260f8","user":{"login":"liujiayi771","id":13622031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771","html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88181374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODE4MTM3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"liujiayi771/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liujiayi771","id":13622031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771","html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nA test from `ParquetIOSuite` is flaky: `SPARK-7837 Do not close output writer twice when commitTask() fails`\r\n\r\nIt turns out to be a race condition. The test injects error to the task committing step, and the job may fail in two ways:\r\n1. The task got the driver's permission to commit the task, but the committing failed and thus the task failed. This will trigger a stage failure as it means possible data duplication, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36564\r\n2. In test we disable task retry, so `TaskSetManager` will abort the stage.\r\n\r\nBoth these two failures are done by sending an event to `DAGScheduler`, so the final job failure depends on which event gets processed first. This is not a big deal, but that test in `ParquetIOSuite` checks the error class. This PR fixes the flaky test by running the test case in a new test suite with output committer coordination disabled\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRecently I noticed a test from `ParquetIOSuite` being flaky: `SPARK-7837 Do not close output writer twice when commitTask() fails`\r\n\r\nIt turns out to be a race condition. The test injects error to the task committing step, and the job may fail in two ways:\r\n1. The task got the driver's permission to commit the task, but the committing failed and thus the task failed. This will trigger a stage failure as it means possible data duplication, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36564\r\n2. In test we disable task retry, so `TaskSetManager` will abort the stage.\r\n\r\nBoth these two failures are done by sending an event to `DAGScheduler`, so the final job failure depends on which event gets processed first. This is not a big deal, but that test in `ParquetIOSuite` checks the error class. This PR fixes the flaky test by disabling output committer coordination. Necessary changes are added to allow the disablement per query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix flaky test\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add a `rule` to `check file headers` for `the java side`, and `fix` inconsistent files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOn the scala side, we have a rule to `check file header`, but we have no corresponding rules on the `java` side to do the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, only for spark developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test\r\n```\r\nsh dev/lint-java\r\nUsing `mvn` from path: /Users/panbingkun/Developer/infra/maven/maven/bin/mvn\r\n-e Checkstyle checks passed.\r\n```\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGuava is not a Hadoop dependency now.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Spark depends on the Hadoop vanilla client and hence pulls all Hadoop transitive deps, and Guava is one of those. While in SPARK-33212, Spark moved to Hadoop Shaded client for Hadoop3, and in SPARK-42452, Spark dropped support for Hadoop2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Hadoop moved to `hadoop-shaded-guava` in HADOOP-17288\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nReview.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer
