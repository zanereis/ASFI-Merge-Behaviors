[#1459](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1459/testReport/junit/kafka.api/PlaintextAdminIntegrationTest/Build___JDK_11_and_Scala_2_12___testElectUncleanLeadersForAllPartitions_String__quorum_kraft/), [#1460](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1460/testReport/junit/kafka.api/PlaintextAdminIntegrationTest/Build___JDK_11_and_Scala_2_12___testDescribeCluster_String__quorum_kraft/)\r\n```\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnknownTopicOrPartitionException: This server does not host this topic-partition.\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.reportGet(CompletableFuture.java:395)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.get(CompletableFuture.java:1999)\r\n\tat org.apache.kafka.common.internals.KafkaFutureImpl.get(KafkaFutureImpl.java:165)\r\n\tat kafka.utils.TestUtils$.describeTopic(TestUtils.scala:475)\r\n\tat kafka.utils.TestUtils$.topicHasSameNumPartitionsAndReplicationFactor(TestUtils.scala:484)\r\n```\r\nThe line failed is when we tried to create a topic but got `TopicExistsException`, so we want to make sure this topic has the expected partition num and replication factor. It failed while trying to describe this topic, and got `UnknownTopicOrPartitionException`. That will happen when topic is created but the metadata haven't propagated to all brokers. So, fix it by explicitly waiting for partition info propagated to all brokers before verifying `topicHasSameNumPartitionsAndReplicationFactor`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

writing a `ByteBuffer` backed by a `HeapBuffer` to a `DataOutputStream`, it is necessary to pass in the offset and the position, not just the position. It is also necessary to pass the remain length, not the limit. The current code results in writing the wrong data to `DataOutputStream`. While the `DataOutputStreamWritable` is used in the project, I do not see any references that would utilize this code path, so this bug fix is relatively minor.\r\n\r\nI added a new test to cover the exact bug. The test fails without this change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

pull request introduces a CommitRequestManager to efficiently manage commit requests from clients and the autocommit state. The manager utilizes a \"staged\" commit queue to store commit requests made by clients. A background thread regularly polls the CommitRequestManager, which then checks the queue for any outstanding commit requests. When permitted, the CommitRequestManager generates a PollResult which contains a list of UnsentRequests that are subsequently processed by the NetworkClientDelegate. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a RequestManagerRegistry has been implemented to hold all request managers, including the new CommitRequestManager and the CoordinatorRequestManager. The registry is regularly polled by a background thread in each event loop, ensuring that all request managers are kept up to date and able to handle incoming requests\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

the new state restoration code, the state updater needs to be checked regularly by the main thread to transfer ownership of tasks back to the main thread once the state of the task is restored. The more often we check this, the faster we can start processing the tasks.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we only check the state updater once in every loop iteration of the state updater. And while we couldn't observe this to be strictly not often enough, we can increase the number of checks easily by moving the check inside the inner processing loop. This means that once we have iterated over `numIterations` records, we can already start processing tasks that have finished restoration in the meantime.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade

introduced new metadata version 9 (IBP_3_4_IV1) for KIP-405, and it breaks the `KafkaServerKRaftRegistrationTest` unexpectedly. The error message is:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Did not see 3 brokers within 30 seconds at org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionUtils.fail(AssertionUtils.java:38) at org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.fail(Assertions.java:134) at kafka.server.KafkaServerKRaftRegistrationTest.testRegisterZkBrokerInKraft1(KafkaServerKRaftRegistrationTest.scala:78)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that in ZK migration mode, the ZK broker will use the IBP as supported version when broker registration as described [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaServer.scala#L406). In the test, we set the metadata version to `IBP_3_4_IV0`, but we didn't set the broker IBP to this version, which will default to the latest version. That's why it failed the tests because the broker registration keeps failing with `unsupportedVersion` error.\r\n\r\nFixed it by setting the broker IBP to the same version as `IBP_3_4_IV0`. We can also fix it by always setting the metadata version to the latest version though, I think what we want here is to make sure everything works fine in `IBP_3_4_IV0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

than relying on measuring Runtime::freeMemory() and calling System.gc(), tests which want to assert that there are no excessive allocations should execute in a restricted-memory environment.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, add a new TestUtil method which intentionally consumes memory in a way that allows tests to assert that the code under test does not over-allocate or leak memory. This is a temporary effect on a single JVM, and is reverted as soon as the test code completes.\r\n\r\nApply this fix to MemoryRecordsBuilderTest::testBuffersDereferencedOnClose(), which now fails if the eponymous close() call is omitted.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

controller metrics in the controllers has three problems. 1) the active controller exposes uncommitted data in the metrics. 2) the active controller doesn't update the metrics when the uncommitted data gets aborted. 3) the controller doesn't update the metrics when the entire state gets reset.\r\n\r\nWe fix these issues by only updating the metrics when processing committed metadata records and reset the metrics when the metadata state is reset.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new type `ControllerMetricsManager` which processes committed metadata records and updates the metrics accordingly. This change also removes metrics updating responsibilities from the rest of the controller managers. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

hard-codes a few configurations, currently the documentation refers to 5 such configs.\r\n\r\nThe four mentioned within - [Parameters controlled by Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#parameters-controlled-by-kafka-streams) + [enable.auto.commit](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#enable-auto-commit).\r\nThree out of the 4 mentioned within the [Parameters controlled by Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#parameters-controlled-by-kafka-streams) are also present within [Default Values](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html#default-values) which state the configurations that can be configured but will have a default value if not set.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes changes to warn the user when a configuration set by them is being overridden.\r\nDue to the overlapping documentation I have gone through the code and have separated the configs in a few categories -\r\n\r\n- Non configurable _consumer_ configs when EOS is **disabled** -\r\n```\r\nenable.auto.commit\r\nallow.auto.create.topics\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Non configurable _consumer_ configs when EOS is **enabled** -\r\n```\r\nisolation.level\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Non configurable _producer_ configs when EOS is **enabled** -\r\n```\r\nenable.idempotence\r\nmax.in.flight.requests.per.connection\r\ntransactional.id\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Default _consumer_ configs which can be configured - \r\n```\r\nauto.offset.reset\r\nmax.poll.records\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Default producer configs which can be configured - \r\n```\r\nlinger.ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n`StreamsConfig` already had code to log warnings when a non-configurable property was being set.\r\nIt was missing logging warnings when `allow.auto.create.topics` was configured. I have added this change and removed the code that was setting `allow.auto.create.topics` within `getMainConsumerConfigs`. \r\n\r\nNow it follows the existing code execution path to check for -\r\n1. Missing default configurations\r\n2. Logging warnings and overriding settings for non-configurable properties.\r\n\r\n[Permalink to checkIfUnexpectedUserSpecifiedConsumerConfig](https://github.com/ashmeet13/kafka/blob/KAFKA-14405/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/StreamsConfig.java#L1427-L1465)\r\n\r\n### Committer

Kafka Connect's `POST /connectors` and `PUT /connectors/{connector}/config` REST APIs internally simply write a message to the Connect cluster's internal config topic (which is then processed asynchronously by the herder). \r\n- However, no callback is passed to the producer's send method and there is no error handling in place for producer send failures (see [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/c1a54671e8fc6c7daec5f5ec3d8c934be96b4989/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/KafkaConfigBackingStore.java#L716) / [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/c1a54671e8fc6c7daec5f5ec3d8c934be96b4989/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/KafkaConfigBackingStore.java#L726)).\r\n- Consider one such case where the Connect worker's principal doesn't have a `WRITE` ACL on the cluster's config topic. Now suppose the user submits a connector's configs via one of the above two APIs. The producer send [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/c1a54671e8fc6c7daec5f5ec3d8c934be96b4989/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/KafkaConfigBackingStore.java#L716) / [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/c1a54671e8fc6c7daec5f5ec3d8c934be96b4989/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/KafkaConfigBackingStore.java#L726) won't succeed (due to a `TopicAuthorizationException`) but the API responses will be `201 Created` success responses anyway.\r\n- This is a very poor UX because the connector will actually never be created but the API response would indicate a successful operation. Furthermore, this failure would only be detectable if TRACE logs are enabled (via [this log)](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/df29b17fc40f7c15460988d58bc652c3d66b60f8/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/ProducerBatch.java) making it near impossible for users to debug.\r\n- This PR updates the `KafkaConfigBackingStore` APIs to use synchronous producer sends in the non-EOS enabled case which surfaces exceptions and also brings the behavior in-line with the EOS enabled case (where the transaction commit ensures the same behavior).\r\n- Side quest: update the outdated Javadoc for `KafkaConfigBackingStore` and improve readability of its rendered form.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

PR introduces the new metadata loader and snapshot generator. For the time being, they are only used by the controller, but a PR for the broker will come soon.\r\n\r\nThe new metadata loader supports adding and removing publishers dynamically. (In contrast, the old loader only supported adding a single publisher.) It also passes along more information about each new image that is published. This information can be found in the LogDeltaManifest and SnapshotManifest classes.\r\n\r\nThe new snapshot generator replaces the previous logic for generating snapshots in QuorumController.java and associated classes. The new generator is intended to be shared between the broker and the controller, so it is decoupled from both.\r\n\r\nThere are a few small changes to the old snapshot generator in this PR. Specifically, we move the batch processing time and batch size metrics out of BrokerMetadataListener.scala and into BrokerServerMetrics.scala.","created_at":"2022-12-13T01:00:13Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T00:53:10Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T00:53:07Z","merged_at":"2022-12-16T00:53:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"29c09e2ca199386efbcb05cdfb10b7376b956233","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/55942812fbfe694416254d82c36be6592f40e29e","head":{"label":"cmccabe:revisit_controller_snaps","ref":"revisit_controller_snaps","sha":"55942812fbfe694416254d82c36be6592f40e29e","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

of writing the KRaft epoch + a large number into the ZK `/controller_epoch` ZNode, this patch changes the behavior to be more like the ZK controller epoch check-and-set operation. If the KRaft epoch to be written is less than the current ZK controller epoch, then we simply increment the controller epoch by one.\r\n\r\nSince we no longer necessarily write the KRaft epoch into `/controller_epoch`, this patch now does a CAS update on `/controller` to ensure that KRaft controllers are registering with increasing epochs. This prevents two KRaft controllers from racing to claim controllership. The algorithm follows:\r\n\r\n* Read `/controller` to get the last written KRaft epoch and the zkVersion\r\n* Read `/controller_epoch` to get the last ZK epoch and zkVersion\r\n* In a Multi-Op:\r\n  *

patch does a few things:\r\n1) It introduces a new flag to the request spec: `latestVersionUnstable`. It signifies that the last version of the API is considered unstable (or still in development). As such, the last API version is not exposed by the server unless specified otherwise with the new internal `unstable.api.versions.enable`. This allows us to commit new APIs which are still in development.\r\n3) It adds the ConsumerGroupHeartbeat API, part of KIP-848, and marks it as unreleased for now.\r\n4) It adds the new error codes required by the new ConsumerGroupHeartbeat API.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

KIP-848, I would like to check-in the new APIs but without exposing them while the KIP is in development. At first, my goal is to gate them by an internal configuration flag defined in KafkaConfig. Later one, this should be dynamic either based on MetadataVersion or another feature flag.\r\n\r\nThis patch is a small refactor in `ApiVersionManager` to allow filtering APIs. The basic idea is to filter them based on KafkaConfig [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/compare/trunk...dajac:kafka:minor-refacor-apiversion-manager?expand=1#diff-b89d6d5e31fa117d2dfb7d242c5035c18556c783f58360ca3b42801100640090R44) so instead of letting the  `ApiVersionManager` determine the available APIs based on the listener type, we give it the allowed set. This is definitely not the end state that I want but is a first step towards it. It will at least allow me to get this APIs checked in safely. We can come back to the dynamic part of it a bit later.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

should be preferred over `ArrayBuffer` in cases where:\r\n1. No indexing is required.\r\n2. The data structure is converted to Java's List from scala.\r\n\r\n`ListBuffer` has a [guaranteed constant time performance](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/performance-characteristics.html) for append operations which makes it a lucrative data structure for  cases when we create a list and append multiple entries to it.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies usage of `ArrayBuffer` to `ListBuffer` in latency sensitive code path. To prove the usefulness of this change, I am attaching a CPU profile for an [open messaging benchmark](https://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/). Please note that the self-time of the `ReplicaManager.fetchMessages()` reduced after this changes (depicted by the empty space in top of the frame for `ReplicaManager.fetchMessages()`.\r\n\r\n**Before

handle the server side, we will leave it to the client to timeout and retry forever (long max) for now.

Eventually if we allow the request to specify the timeout, we will at least try until the brokerToControllerChannelManager's timeout.\r\n\r\nNow, we retry on timeouts and the errors that retry sending the request.

MetadataProvenance to encapsulate the three-tuple of (offset, epoch, timestamp) that is associated with each MetadataImage, as well as each on-disk snapshot.\r\n\r\nRemove offset and epoch tracking from MetadataDelta. We do not really need to know this information until we are creating the final MetadataImage object. Therefore, this bookkeeping should be done by the metadata loading code, not inside the delta code, like the other bookkeeping. This simplifies a lot of tests, as well as simplifying RecordTestUtils.  Also introduce a builder for MetadataDelta.\r\n\r\nAdd ImageReWriter, an ImageWriter that applies records to a MetadataDelta. This is useful when you need to create a MetadataDelta object that holds the contents of a MetadataImage. This will be used in the new image loader code (coming soon).\r\n\r\nAdd ImageWriterOptionsTest to test

ID we use for snapshots consists last committed epoch in the log and the (exclusive) last committed offset. That is, the offset in the ID is one more than the offset of the last committed record. This is currently handled a bit inconsistently in the codebase. For example, `MetadataImage` internally tracks the (inclusive) highest offset and epoch of records contained within the image. However, for an empty image, which contains no log records, the offset is incorrectly initialized to 0. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, I've tried to make the bookkeeping a little more consistent:\r\n\r\n- Use the exclusive offset/epoch in `MetadataImage` as an \"imageId\" (which then corresponds exactly to a the snapshotId generated from the image)\r\n- Also use the exclusive highest offset in `MetadataDelta`\r\n- Modify `RaftClient.createSnapshot` to pass the snapshotId directly instead of the inclusive last committed offset and epochs.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this is that we can define a non-negative offset/epoch to represent each image. For an empty metadata image, we can use 0 as both the offset and epoch. Unfortunately, there are still a few places in the codebase which expect inclusive offsets, so we still have some awkward increments/decrements here and there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

out the logic for applying dynamic configurations to a KafkaConfig object from BrokerMetadataPublisher into a new class, DynamicConfigPublisher. This will allow the ControllerServer to also run this code, in a follow-up change.\r\n\r\nCreate separate KafkaConfig objects in BrokerServer versus ControllerServer. This is necessary because the controller will apply configuration changes as soon as its raft client catches up to the high water mark, whereas the broker will wait for the active controller to acknowledge it has caught up in a heartbeat response. So when running in combined mode, we want two separate KafkaConfig objects that are changed at different times.\r\n\r\nMinor changes: improve the error message when catching up broker metadata fails. Fix incorrect indentation in checkstyle/import-control.xml. Invoke AppInfoParser.unregisterAppInfo from SharedServer.stop so that it happens only when both the controller and broker have shut down.","created_at":"2022-12-06T01:35:19Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T18:43:38Z","closed_at":"2022-12-07T18:43:34Z","merged_at":"2022-12-07T18:43:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"100e87467135514170bdd4a0614f9b1c37c04c48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/09fda32a67f98042f73ec27477c7b7db3c287803","head":{"label":"cmccabe:ak-image-next2","ref":"ak-image-next2","sha":"09fda32a67f98042f73ec27477c7b7db3c287803","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

consumer should refresh preferred read replica on update metadata\r\n    \r\nThe consumer (fetcher) used to refresh the preferred read replica on\r\nthree conditions:\r\n    \r\n1. the consumer receives an OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE error\r\n2. the follower does not exist in the client's metadata (i.e., offline)\r\n3. after metadata.max.age.ms (5 min default)\r\n    \r\nFor other errors, it will continue to reach to the possibly unavailable\r\nfollower and only after 5 minutes will it refresh the preferred read\r\nreplica and go back to the leader.\r\n    \r\nAnother problem is that the client might have stale metadata and not\r\nsend fetches to preferred replica, even after the leader redirects to\r\nthe preferred replica.\r\n    \r\nA specific example is when a partition is reassigned. the consumer will\r\nget NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER which triggers a metadata update but the\r\npreferred read replica will not be refreshed as the follower is still\r\nonline. it will continue to reach out to the old follower until the\r\npreferred read replica expires.\r\n    \r\nThe consumer can instead refresh its preferred read replica whenever it\r\nmakes a metadata update request, so when the consumer receives i.e.\r\nNOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER it can find the new preferred read replica without\r\nwaiting for the expiration.\r\n    \r\nGenerally, we will rely on the leader to choose the correct preferred\r\nread replica and have the consumer fail fast (clear preferred read replica\r\ncache) on errors and reach out to the leader.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jeff Kim

good for us to add support for Java 20 in preparation for Java 21 - the next LTS.\r\n\r\nGiven that Scala 2.12 support has been deprecated, a Scala 2.12 variant is not included.\r\n\r\nAlso remove some branch builds that add load to the CI, but have\r\nlow value: JDK 8 & Scala 2.13 (JDK 8 support has been deprecated),\r\nJDK 11 & Scala 2.12 (Scala 2.12 support has been deprecated) and\r\nJDK 17 & Scala 2.12 (Scala 2.12 support has been deprecated).\r\n\r\nA newer version of Mockito (4.9.0 -> 4.11.0) is required for Java 20 support, but we\r\nonly use it with Scala 2.13+ since it causes compilation errors with Scala 2.12. Similarly,\r\nwe upgrade easymock when the Java version is 16 or newer as it's incompatible\r\nwith powermock (which doesn't support Java 16 or newer).\r\n\r\nFiled KAFKA-15117 for a test that fails with Java 20 (SslTransportLayerTest.testValidEndpointIdentificationCN).\r\n\r\nFinally, fixed some lossy conversions that were added after #13582 was submitted.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the [JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6586):\r\n> The main methods in ConnectDistributed and ConnectStandalone have a lot of duplication, and it'd be good to refactor to centralize the logic. We can pull most of this logic into an abstract class that ConnectStandalone and ConnectDistributed both extend. At a glance, the differences between the two are different config and Herder implementations and some different initialization logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

patch adds support for reading and writing ZooKeeper metadata during a [KIP-866](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-866+ZooKeeper+to+KRaft+Migration) migration. \r\n\r\nFor reading metadata from ZK, code from KafkaZkClient and ZkData is reused to ensure we are decoding the JSON correctly.\r\n\r\nFor writing metadata, we create a special multi-op transaction that ensures only a single controller is writing to ZK. The transaction consists of three operations:\r\n\r\n* CheckOp on `/controller_epoch`\r\n* SetDataOp on `/migration` with zkVersion\r\n* CreateOp/SetDataOp/DeleteOp (the actual operation being applied)\r\n\r\nIn the case of a batch of operations (such as topic creation), only the final MultiOp has a SetDataOp on `/migration` (the other requests use a CheckOp similar to `/controller_epoch`).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-03T01:05:57Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T18:14:02Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T18:14:02Z","merged_at":"2022-12-08T18:14:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"d40561e90ab5b1f5c79d174393645c22b5797eff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/705532cbb824ad9bac3a07b371317ee392c8924a","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-14427-zk-migration-client","ref":"KAFKA-14427-zk-migration-client","sha":"705532cbb824ad9bac3a07b371317ee392c8924a","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14437\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThis is a solution to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14437. The idea is to enhance `StripedReplicaPlacer` to use previous partition assignments to set the initial `RackList` and `BrokerList` state such that we don't create the same assignments for new partitions. This is done by making a best effort attempt at determining what the last offset was when the previous partition assignment(s) were made. By offset I'm referring to the `offset` variable in both `BrokerList` and `RackList`. Currently, whenever `place` is called we randomly choose an offset to start from. With this change, we'll instead use a topics previous partition assignments to try and determine an offset that makes it appear as though we're continuing from where we left off when last making assignments for the topic. Comments are in the code to explain the logic.\r\n\r\n`ClusterDescriber` was updated to have a new method `replicasForTopicName` that is used by `StripedReplicaPlacer` to get a topics existing partition assignments, if any. This means in practice it returns the pre-existing partition assignments when servicing `CreatePartitions` requests.  \r\n\r\nThis change ultimately improves how balanced partitions are when `CreatePartitions` is called by users.\r\n\r\nNote, this results in no change to topic creation as there would be no existing partition assignments. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from
