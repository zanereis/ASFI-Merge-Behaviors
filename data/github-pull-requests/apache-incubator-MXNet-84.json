another pull request for #6231 after we reverted it due to broken docs.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to **test the python installation guide** for MacOS CPU on Travis. We test the installation instructions in a clean environment via pip, virtualenv, and from source.\r\n\r\nThere are two tasks that I've added to Travis as shown in the .travis.yml file:\r\n\r\n1. installation_packaged_test\r\n- Tests instructions for installing MXNet via either 1) virtualenv 2) pip\r\n- Runs a simple Python sanity test (create NDArray)\r\n- Takes 2 minutes\r\n\r\n2. installation_source_test\r\n- Tests instructions for installing MXNet from source\r\n- Runs a simple Python sanity test (create NDArray)\r\n- Takes 16 minutes\r\n- Needed to be put in a second task because it needs a clean environment\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n1. I added logic to run installation tasks only if the diff between this branch and the mxnet's master branch contains install.md.\r\n2. The installation_source_test task fails in Travis because my changes to install-mxnet-osx-python.sh needs to be merged.\r\n3. The motivation behind this PR is to **test the installation _guide**_ rather than the package.\r\n4. I've built the docs and manually checked that the docs page looks

to makefiles/config to safely enable use of lapack based functionalities by default. By platform:\r\n- Windows: No issues as we get lapack  with openblas automatically\r\n- osx: No issues as we get lapack with \"apple\" automatically\r\n- Ubuntu: On Ubuntu 14.04 we don't get the lapack-library automatically installed with openblas. On all Ubuntu versions we don't get it automatically installed when using \"atlas\". The simplest and most consistent handling is to explicitly check whether the lapack-library is in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib and if not, then switch off lapack support automatically.\r\n\r\nIn addition provided an extra variable in the config to support setting a custom path for the lapack library. Just for convenience. \r\n\r\nBTW: The build using \"atlas\" is generally broken on Ubuntu (at least). Reason is that the mshadow-config adds a \"-lcblas\" while Ubuntu will install a \"blas\"-library. The latter is in contrast to the official atlas documentation which states that the library is \"cblas\". But as atlas is not providing precompiled libraries, guess anyone else is free to name them differently and apparently that is what happened. We have no regression build for atlas on Jenkins, so we never see this. \r\nEric, do you think we can simply change this setting in mshadow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-15T13:30:39Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T18:07:06Z","closed_at":"2017-06-18T21:23:30Z","merged_at":"2017-06-18T21:23:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"423490c03e6ee43aa4ad9980932d8af85010410b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/0af862f11cd05d7a0a1e4603a7e9b5d0e146f29f","head":{"label":"asmushetzel:la_default","ref":"la_default","sha":"0af862f11cd05d7a0a1e4603a7e9b5d0e146f29f","user":{"login":"asmushetzel","id":25875939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODc1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25875939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel","html_url":"https://github.com/asmushetzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85088258,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTA4ODI1OA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"asmushetzel/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asmushetzel","id":25875939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODc1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25875939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel","html_url":"https://github.com/asmushetzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asmushetzel/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

added a script which compares layer by layer both the **weights** and the **outputs** of a caffe model and its converted mxnet model.\r\n\r\nThe script by default runs on the known test models mentioned in **test_converter.py**, namely: **bvlc_googlenet**, **vgg-16** and **resnet-50**.\r\nIn addition the script offers functions for comparing any model by supplying the parameters of the caffe model.\r\n\r\nThe script goes over the layers of the network DAG, in BFS order, and compares the layer's parameters, usually weights and bias, but others as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition the script takes an image as input and run inference using both caffe and mxnet models, and compare the blob outputs of each layer, taking into consideration inplace layers.\r\n\r\nFor each weight blob and output blob the script log to screen the mean and max of the absolute difference between the blobs.\r\n\r\nAttached output generated when running the script using default parameters: [compare_layers_output.txt](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/files/1070397/compare_layers_output.txt)\r\n\r\nSince the script runs caffe inference, it depends on caffe being installed. The dependency is implicit, so the user of the script can resolve it by installing his favorite caffe version and setting the proper environment variables. All the script requires is that 'import caffe' will work.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-13T05:43:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T05:13:53Z","closed_at":"2017-06-22T17:04:51Z","merged_at":"2017-06-22T17:04:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ba880968de51fb4d4151eba4668a789161181e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/005374a3e121380b1052daa38b1290b5e6b5d062","head":{"label":"arikpoz:add_layer_comparison","ref":"add_layer_comparison","sha":"005374a3e121380b1052daa38b1290b5e6b5d062","user":{"login":"arikpoz","id":9167746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjc3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9167746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz","html_url":"https://github.com/arikpoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92770955,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mjc3MDk1NQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"arikpoz/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arikpoz","id":9167746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjc3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9167746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz","html_url":"https://github.com/arikpoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arikpoz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arikpoz/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
