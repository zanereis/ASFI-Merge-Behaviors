use AWS Kendra a central search tool in our organization to provide a search result that can span different Data Source (DB, Sharepoint, etc).\r\n\r\nSince we have a lot of documents in our Wiki, it is interesting for us to be able to index (in Kendra) and search pages and attachments from our wiki.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it is important to be able to search in attachments that are in PDF / Word / PPT or HTML format also.\r\n\r\nWe have implemented a SearchProvider that does the job of indexing and returning search result. The code is available in https://github.com/rostskadat/jspwiki\r\n\r\nSome further documentation is available in the README.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you could direct me toward a document
