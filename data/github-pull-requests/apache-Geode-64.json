cleaned up GMSEncrypt and then we worked together to fix this bug.\r\nThe problem was happening when a new member joined with a coordinator that\r\nsuddenly shuts down before other members have been told to install the\r\nnew membership view.  They've received a \"prepare for view change\" message\r\ncontaining the new view but have not been told to commit that change.\r\n\r\nAnother member then becomes coordinator and sees that there was a new member\r\nin the prepared view.  It picks this up and adds it to the new view it\r\nsends out.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the public encryption keys of the members weren't\r\nbeing transferred from the old view to the new view and when looking for\r\npublic keys we were fishing them out of GMSEncrypt instead of getting\r\nthem from the membership view.  This caused an NPE to be thrown when trying\r\nto fish out the public key of the new member - GMSEncrypt didn't know about\r\nthis new member because the view containing it was never installed - it\r\nwas only prepared.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to transfer the public keys from the old view to the new one and\r\nto look for public keys in the view instead of GMSEncrypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
