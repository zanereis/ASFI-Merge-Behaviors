What does this PR do\r\n\r\nAdd support for `basic_auth` backend to the new UI Rest API. Add relevant permissions helper and tests. The goal for this is first to show how permissions and auth can be handled in FastAPI and also have a small working POC for us to be able to then work on the front end. (And be able to migrate existing endpoints **with** appropriate permission decorators and write test against that as well).\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n- Allow the endpoint migrations to be ported with the appropriate permissions and tested, to not loose them in transit\r\n- Use this PR as a preliminary work to discuss and see how FastAPI can integrate our permission/auth code, make a POC with the `basic_auth` backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What this PR does not do\r\nAfter some digging in the last two days, I find that our `auth_backends` implementations, `auth_manager` init code, `BaseAuthManager` and more importantly `FabAuthManager` etc. are tightly coupled to flask. For instance the way we read webserver config file from python with `from_pyfile`, check app config with `app.config`, access global flask object from within an app context `g`, `request`, `get_current_user`, `flask_login`, `current_app`, all of that does not work without flask.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not rewrite all that code to be `Flask` / webserver framework agnostic and usable with FastAPI because the effort is too high at the moment and this is not what I am trying to demonstrate with this PR.\r\n\r\nWe basically use the `flask_app` init code to initialize correctly all the different helper classes, and I added a few checks here and there to make the basic auth work outside of a Flask app context.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10 25

The previous implementation used \"\\\\\\n\" to join lines, resulting in \"\\n\" printed at the beginning of the lines.

Added a new configuration option `call_on_kill_on_dagrun_timeout` to control whether tasks should be killed when a DAG run times out (default: True).\r\n2. Updated logic in `_schedule_dag_run` to call task `on_kill` if  `call_on_kill_on_dagrun_timeout` is enabled.\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/41036\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- Added unit test for the new timeout handling logic\r\n- Verified that the new configuration option works as expected\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-04T16:53:10Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T15:20:10Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"

This is how it is done today in auth managers to register custom views. This will change in the future and will likely leverage the mechanism provided by AIP-68 to create new views in the Airflow environment through plugins\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

to #41967 and parallel to #41991 \r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we remove the behavior that detected an `--ignore` switch and removed the pytest directory arg, and instead fail out of the test call when this scenario is detected.\r\n\r\nPytest prioritizes the test arg over the ignore switch, so this code was inverting the way pytest expects to be used which creates complexity when reasoning about breeze and the CI test suites. Also, with #41991, we should be not calling these kinds of scenarios anyway, and raising an error will help us locate any straggler cases.\r\n\r\nIOW, the command `pytest tests/providers/alpha --ignore=tests/providers/alpha` will run the tests in `tests/providers/alpha` (the ignore is ignored). Our change in #40037 attempted to override this behavior and prioritize the ignore switch; it is simpler to understand the system if we detect these scenarios upstream instead of force-fitting the reverse of how pytest wants to work.\r\n\r\nThis change refactors the `_run_test` function in the following ways:\r\n- All arguments for docker down and docker run commands are built before any docker calls are made\r\n- A check is made to see if any pytest directory arg is also specified in an `--ignore=<dir>` switch; if so, a system exit is initiated\r\n- Some argument construction steps are moved into dedicated functions for readability and testability\r\n\r\nTests have been added to verify the exit functionality and also validate some of the collaborator calls. I didn't feel the need to test the entire control flow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

apache/airflow#41665\r\n\r\nIn the original PR, we considered absolute paths, but we also need to account for relative paths, as this is leading to [issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/41977). I tried to explore the possible option to extend the check to relative paths but couldn't find any good options as they can vary a lot(especially strings like `page.html`) \r\n\r\n### Possible relative paths\r\nRelative to Current Directory:\r\n\r\n    page.html – Points to a file page.html in the current directory.\r\n    images/logo.png – Points to an images folder and the logo.png file within the current directory.\r\n\r\nRelative to Parent Directory:\r\n\r\n    ../about.html – Points to about.html in the parent directory.\r\n    ../assets/styles.css – Points to styles.css in the assets folder in the parent directory.\r\n\r\nRelative to the Root Directory:\r\n\r\n    /index.html – Points to index.html in the root directory of the site.\r\n    /css/styles.css – Points to the styles.css file in the css folder within the root directory.\r\n\r\nRelative to the Current Path:\r\n\r\n    ./file.html – Points to file.html in the current directory (same as file.html).\r\n    ./folder/page.html – Points to page.html in the folder within the current directory.\r\n\r\nRelative URL with Anchor (Fragment Identifier):\r\n\r\n    #section1 – Points to the element with the

the **helm chart** I was unable to get SSH-based git sync to run. Debugging lead to two issues:\r\n\r\n- The secret is mounted as `root`, with permissions `0660`, which makes it unreadable for git-sync default user 65533.\r\n- If switching to user `root` (which I did not want to do), the SSH key file is still mounted as `0660`, which makes SSH complain and ignore it.\r\n\r\nThat fix uses the init-container to fix the SSH key permissions (ownership, and file mode `0400`), which should now work with any user without any k8s-yaml-fu-magic :) .\r\n\r\nAlso, mounting secrets with non-root _ownership_ (not: group ownership) [seems impossible ATM](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81089).\r\n\r\nIf there in fact _is_ a solution for this, I would be very interested in some example helm values file config :) . I was – as mentioned – unable to create it.\r\n\r\n**Update: some reasoning additions below**\r\n\r\n* I found [this documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/master/docs/ssh.md#full-example) to be incorrect in that it seems not possible to run as non-root-user, ...\r\n* ... as I tried to replicate

#41555 we found two subtle bugs in how Breeze prepares pytest arguments when testing providers. This change fixes one of those bugs, and adds a test for another one which should be fixed in a future PR as it probably requires a refactor.\r\n\r\nBoth bugs stem from Breeze's attempt to force-skip a provider test if it is supposed to be ignored (#40037) - the code looks for pytest suite args that are also ignored, e.g. \"`tests/providers/myprovider`\" and \"`--ignore=tests/providers/myprovider`\". When these are found, the suite arg is removed from the pytest args (normal pytest behavior prioritizes a suite arg over an ignore switch, and runs the suite tests anyway).\r\n\r\nNB: the bug 1 tests and code were written in a TDD style - the first commit adds the suspension/exclusion tests that need to succeed, the second commit fixes the production code so the tests go green. The primary-arg test is always green and demonstrates the bug 2 behavior.\r\n\r\n### Bug 1: \r\n\r\na. If a provider is marked for removal in compat checks (in the `BASE_PROVIDERS_COMPATIBILITY_CHECKS` global), Breeze adds an ignore switch to the `extra_pytest_args` of the form `--ignore=tests/providers/<provider-id>`\r\n\r\nb. If a provider is marked as excluded on Python 3.8 (or suspended), Breeze adds 3 ignore switches for unit, system and integration tests; these switches do _not_ use the `=` to connect key and value and so each ignore is two separate arguments, e.g. `--ignore tests/providers/<provider-id>`\r\n\r\n-> When the force-skip code sees the `--ignore=...` switch from (a), it finds the \"matching\" `tests/providers/<provider-id>` argument and thinks it is the test suite argument, when it is really the value for the ignore switch from (b). This leaves a dangling `--ignore` switch key without a value, causing pytest to fail the command.\r\n\r\nThe change looks like this (omitting other irrelevant arguments):\r\n\r\n`tests/providers --ignore tests/providers/myprovider --ignore tests/system/providers/myprovider --ignore tests/integration/providers/myprovider --ignore=tests/providers/myprovider`\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n`tests/providers --ignore --ignore tests/system/providers/myprovider --ignore tests/integration/providers/myprovider --ignore=tests/providers/myprovider`\r\n\r\nThe result is an invalid pytest command and a test failure.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nThe simplest and safest fix is to make the exclusion switches (b above) conform to `key=value` switch format. This way, the ignore statement cannot be mistakenly read as a suite arg and removed from the command.\r\n\r\nThis fix is done in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Bug 2:\r\nBug 2 comes from a combination of the existing force-skip code and behavior introduced by the fix to bug 1.\r\n\r\nIn lowest-direct-dependency tests, providers are tested individually, with each provider getting its own pytest command testing its specific tests directory. As mentioned above in (b), any excluded provider results in 3 ignore switches being added to the pytest command. \r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the force-skip code causes the suite arg itself to be removed from the pytest command:\r\n\r\n`tests/providers/myprovider --ignore=tests/providers/myprovider --ignore=tests/system/providers/myprovider --ignore tests/integration/providers/myprovider`\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n`tests/providers/myprovider --ignore=tests/providers/myprovider --ignore=tests/system/providers/myprovider --ignore tests/integration/providers/myprovider`\r\n\r\nThis is a valid pytest command, which tests every test pytest can find. The intended provider is excluded, as expected, but we also expected no other tests to be run instead of running the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nThis fix is marked as a todo in the test code. Probably it requires refactoring the `_run_test` function so that it can skip running a test entirely; it seems like a skip is the best option for a situation where a specific test suite is expected to be run but also expected to be ignored. (Another nice part of the refactor would be splitting out the argument-generating code into functions, so args could be tested without calling `_run_test`).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-02T23:28:21Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T13:28:38Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T05:31:13Z","merged_at":"2024-09-03T05:31:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"71bfdfd1326fcebc9d741e7cfc9bd8c8c317b055","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/41967/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/41967/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/41967/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c6069b45feec8b52826e2fc54c41f53655ec9e59","head":{"label":"topherinternational:excluded-providers-3.8","ref":"excluded-providers-3.8","sha":"c6069b45feec8b52826e2fc54c41f53655ec9e59","user":{"login":"topherinternational","id":48180628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTgwNjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48180628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational","html_url":"https://github.com/topherinternational","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":839537456,"node_id":"R_kgDOMgpTMA","name":"airflow","full_name":"topherinternational/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"topherinternational","id":48180628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTgwNjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48180628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational","html_url":"https://github.com/topherinternational","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/topherinternational/orgs","repos_url":"https:/

Any other call will not be detected. Statically detecting these calls is challenging, so for now we should probably leave it like this, on a best effort basis with an important notice at the top.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think we can cross reference that with OL translators provided for schema in all providers and detect which hook has OL translator provided. We can assume that when adding hook level lineage, one will try to add ol translator as well. I'll try to work on some most popular hooks soon.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Gen AI Evaluation Service lets you evaluate your large language models (LLMs), both pointwise and pairwise, across several metrics, with your own criteria. You can provide inference-time inputs, LLM responses and additional parameters, and the Gen AI Evaluation Service returns metrics specific to the evaluation task.\r\n\r\nMetrics include model-based metrics, such as PointwiseMetric and PairwiseMetric, and in-memory computed metrics, such as rouge, bleu, and tool function-call metrics. PointwiseMetric and PairwiseMetric are generic model-based metrics that you can customize with your own criteria. Because the service takes the prediction results directly from models as input, the evaluation service can perform both inference and subsequent evaluation on all models supported by Vertex AI.\r\n\r\nFor more information on evaluating a model, see [Generative AI evaluation service overview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview).\r\n\r\nCan be

Gen AI Evaluation Service lets you evaluate your large language models (LLMs), both pointwise and pairwise, across several metrics, with your own criteria. You can provide inference-time inputs, LLM responses and additional parameters, and the Gen AI Evaluation Service returns metrics specific to the evaluation task.\r\n\r\nMetrics include model-based metrics, such as PointwiseMetric and PairwiseMetric, and in-memory computed metrics, such as rouge, bleu, and tool function-call metrics. PointwiseMetric and PairwiseMetric are generic model-based metrics that you can customize with your own criteria. Because the service takes the prediction results directly from models as input, the evaluation service can perform both inference and subsequent evaluation on all models supported by Vertex AI.\r\n\r\nFor more information on evaluating a model, see [Generative AI evaluation service overview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview).\r\n\r\nCan be

@bbovenzi for the new UI page and contribution docs. Looks really nice with built in dark mode from ground up. New build system using Vite and HMR is really nice. I don't need to reload for changes and enables a faster feedback loop with state intact. I tried implementing basic pagination for the new UI page. I opened this PR for initial feedback and some questions on trying out the implementation in new UI. I guess it serves as a good point to discuss and improve upon.\r\n\r\nQuestions \r\n\r\n1. In the previous API the case of the keys of the response used to be changed using interceptor. In this case will this be applicable to new API/UI? like total_entries will become totalEntries?\r\n2. Default dags per page is configurable in airflow.cfg . Earlier the values used to be passed along meta tag for rendering. In this case page title and page size are some of the attributes that might be needed. I don't see any endpoint in airflow/www/views.py so I was wondering how to get those values here like the other react implementation. Currently, I just used 10 hard coded as a constant.\r\n3. The new UI generates API stubs from openapi I guess similar to the other react project. Will this be merged eventually as I see useQuery for other parts with somewhat different conventions compared to the current one where useDagServiceGetDags is used.\r\n\r\nPagination Ref : \r\n\r\nhttps://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/guide/pagination#manual-server-side-pagination\r\nhttps://medium.com/@aylo.srd/server-side-pagination-and-sorting-with-tanstack-table-and-react-bd493170125e\r\n\r\nScreenshot : (first page, previous page, next page, last page)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4d9f45c-f7cd-4503-85a0-516da675a5b6)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-30T18:47:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T16:47:11Z","closed_at":"2024-09-04T16:47:11Z","merged_at":"2024-09-04T16:47:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"7650f09d5647be6331a804c513a80df43be8a10e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

I was (together with @kaxil ) taking a look to the Scarf reports I saw some minor improvements we can have for the collected metrics:\r\n\r\n1. We are not actually interested in the (exact) Python version but Major.Minor is sufficient. Too preceise metrics are not getting a good report\r\n2. Same for DB Version. Major+Minor is sufficient\r\n3.

When a new job is launched (with `CheckJobRunning.WaitForRun` setting), it should wait until the previous job with the same name is cancelled/drained. When non default `location` is used `europe-west1`, it's ignored and, thus, the previous job cannot be found at the same location, leading to the new job starting.\r\n    - I tried excplicitly passing the location to `is_job_dataflow_running`, however, because of the of the `@_fallback_to_location_from_variables` annotation an exception is raised regarding mutually exclusive parameters being specified:\r\n        ```\r\n        [2024-08-28, 11:49:18 UTC] {taskinstance.py:2905} ERROR - Task failed with exception\r\n        Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n        File \"/opt/bitnami/airflow/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 465, in _execute_task\r\n            result = _execute_callable(context=context, **execute_callable_kwargs)\r\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        File \"/opt/bitnami/airflow/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 432, in _execute_callable\r\n            return execute_callable(context=context, **execute_callable_kwargs)\r\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        File \"/opt/bitnami/airflow/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/models/baseoperator.py\", line 401, in wrapper\r\n            return func(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        File \"/opt/bitnami/airflow/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/providers/apache/beam/operators/beam.py\", line 556, in execute\r\n            return self.execute_sync(context)\r\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        File \"/opt/bitnami/airflow/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/providers/apache/beam/operators/beam.py\", line 574, in execute_sync\r\n            is_running = self.dataflow_hook.is_job_dataflow_running(\r\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n        File \"/opt/bitnami/airflow/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/dataflow.py\", line 125, in inner_wrapper\r\n            raise AirflowException(\r\n        airflow.exceptions.AirflowException: The mutually exclusive parameter `location` and `region` key in `variables` parameter are both present. Please remove one.\r\n        ```\r\n    -  While `@_fallback_to_location_from_variables` should ensure that a fallback location value is used from `variables` (`pipeline_options`) when `location` is not supplied, this never happens because the default `location: str = DEFAULT_DATAFLOW_LOCATION` is set in the function, resulting in `us-central1` to always be used as `location`\r\n    - I've fixed this issue by removing `@_fallback_to_location_from_variables` annotation from `is_job_dataflow_running` defined in `providers/google/cloud/hooks/dataflow.py`. I also removed the default `location` value setting in `is_job_dataflow_running` because, to my mind, it cause more harm than it is useful. In all the calls of `is_job_dataflow_running` I passed location values available in scope, which by default is set to `location: str = DEFAULT_DATAFLOW_LOCATION` anyway when looking at the class constructors.\r\n\r\nHow my testing task is configured:\r\n```\r\nstart_beam_pipeline = BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"start-beam-pipeline\",\r\n    runner=\"DataflowRunner\",\r\n

This code seemed to be doing redundant work. Below is a flamegraph of the airflow scheduler process captured by a statistical profiler ([py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy)) during a period of heavy load (4000 tasks required scheduling). \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 2 02 00 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0279bdf2-1e27-4599-abf6-b59a0a6b3d45)\r\n\r\nDuring this 1 minute profiler session, the scheduler spent 42% of it's time on nested within [this line](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/celery/executors/celery_executor.py#L304) of code. The reason this code is so hot is that when using celery with a database results backend, celery [will not pool database connections](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/main/celery/backends/database/session.py#L43-L53) (unless process is forked) and thus a new db connection must be established for each task in the loop. This is very expensive and scales with number of tasks. We can see from flame graph most of the time is spent creating a database connection. \r\n\r\nThe solution put forth in this PR is to remove this operation entirely from the _process_tasks function. This is based on the justification that immediately after the celery executor processes tasks, the [sync method of the celery executor will be called by its parent base executor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/executors/base_executor.py#L241-L245) to sync task state. In my view, this renders this line of code redundant. \r\n\r\nWhen calling sync, the celery executor [makes use of batch fetching](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/celery/executors/celery_executor.py#L340) and thus is more optimized.\r\n\r\nSome additional deployment

If the task completes during that time then operator won't defer it again, however it also doesn't evaluate the reason for the completion, so if the pod ends in an error, it will still be marked as successful.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to always defer when the task resumes while the pod is in a running state, so that the next resume will notice the pod exit and act accordingly, however alternatively we could check the pod exit state and skip the deferment.  I'm happy to amend the PR if this is

When the file processor processes DAG file, it produces stack trace and store into database, which can later be accessed.\r\n\r\n# What's enhanced\r\nWhen the dag file process manager encounters import error, it will produce span event containing the relative stack trace so that user does not have to navigate into Airflow UI to see the import error separately. The user will be able to check which DAG file caused it, along with type, name, and exception stack
