[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-15T08:59:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T09:29:46Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f9136317cf8d827b66eeecba1106475dda48390","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13366/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13366/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13366/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/00863570cd22ec2daa9191486509a4da1286bd6c","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1115-report","ref":"1115-report","sha":"00863570cd22ec2daa9191486509a4da1286bd6c","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

from #13334 due to branch operation error.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix #13327 \r\n- `dubbo.jstack-dump.max-line` can be used to indicate that all stack trace lines should be printed now by setting it to a negative number, -1 for example.\r\n- write stack trace info directly into OutputStream instead of building a String.\r\n- Add tests in `JVMUtilTest`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Support custom print stack depth and write error messages directly into OutputStream in `org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.JVMUtil`.\r\n- Add tests in `org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.JVMUtilTest`.\r\n- Add stack dump test code in `AbortPolicyWithReportTest`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n- Add comments in `RandomLoadBalance` to make it easier for people to understand its logic.\r\n- Rewrite a part of its logic to improve efficiency. Assuming the difference between the expected index to be found and the index returned by `Arrays.binarySearch` is `gap` (for example, the returned index is 1 while the expected is 3, then the gap is 2), the previous logic will calculate i `2 * gap` times. However, this will be reduced to only `gap` times after rewriting.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Add comments and optimize logic in `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.cluster.loadbalance.RandomLoadBalance`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-14T11:31:42Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T12:21:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4481d2d26402bce143a85d44f94bf9d2a7933f51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/59659de9059ae6a120168b78c242029c72cea0e7","head":{"label":"Linchen-Xu:opt-rnd-lb","ref":"opt-rnd-lb","sha":"59659de9059ae6a120168b78c242029c72cea0e7","user":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693248002,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVIgAg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Linchen-Xu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-14T08:38:42Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T11:57:33Z","closed_at":"2023-11-14T11:57:32Z","merged_at":"2023-11-14T11:57:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"31712083f40688d3b6ce59d4a3ad82ff27a3c06b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f1d599c68f9c50f47219f2534529ff7eee300ac0","head":{"label":"xiaoyuuuuuupeng:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"f1d599c68f9c50f47219f2534529ff7eee300ac0","user":{"login":"xiaoyuuuuuupeng","id":30964063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTY0MDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30964063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoyuuuuuupeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoyuuuuuupeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"c877d6e6f9514ca3f5d5dfd147254352c75c6ae5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfor #13341\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n* stop startup if the configuration of dubbo application name is invalid\r\n* fix unit tests affected by this PR\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-09T10:17:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T14:55:18Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T14:55:18Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T14:55:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d04bc5c250f9a86e7d3dfb2ac03629fc9194693","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cbecf4073f0a4c503a7f9103159182b7eea0ee2d","head":{"label":"zrlw:3.2-feature-checkAppName","ref":"3.2-feature-checkAppName","sha":"cbecf4073f0a4c503a7f9103159182b7eea0ee2d","user":{"login":"zrlw","id":40652892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjUyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40652892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw","html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":382837484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODI4Mzc0ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zrlw/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zrlw","id":40652892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjUyODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40652892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw","html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrlw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zrlw/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-09T10:17:08Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T03:27:17Z","closed_at":"2023-11-10T03:27:17Z","merged_at":"2023-11-10T03:27:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"865f68bdc562c8f1144888f1900671fe3af42ac2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13342/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13342/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13342/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fd173bf161502fadc57e3948ba63e8beb2c2442f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1109-compiler","ref":"1109-compiler","sha":"fd173bf161502fadc57e3948ba63e8beb2c2442f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-09T09:04:02Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T12:58:43Z","closed_at":"2023-11-29T12:58:43Z","merged_at":"2023-11-29T12:58:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f48269562bda8cba9a7b50b35757ae80c3826a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1c0eadc7903d1b91c5eb15991412681ff8452d9c","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-adjust-deployer-event","ref":"3.2-adjust-deployer-event","sha":"1c0eadc7903d1b91c5eb15991412681ff8452d9c","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-08T07:38:45Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T06:13:39Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T06:05:17Z","merged_at":"2023-11-15T06:05:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"b74cf5be3f427867e69832e74f83d6aaa9276708","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/59fefcbf46e9fd545a638666a9cf4d6d182f238b","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-fix-generic-method-name","ref":"3.2-fix-generic-method-name","sha":"59fefcbf46e9fd545a638666a9cf4d6d182f238b","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-08T06:05:37Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T06:05:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f10e91cdf7b1feab9b6b6229ae760fae10d6468","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13335/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13335/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13335/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9a6aacd66d45cee91e21c71e2135aa57b1d8f8b6","head":{"label":"liuzg-coder:optimize-applicationmodel","ref":"optimize-applicationmodel","sha":"9a6aacd66d45cee91e21c71e2135aa57b1d8f8b6","user":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":691446148,"node_id":"R_kgDOKTahhA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liuzg-coder/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-07T08:19:58Z","updated_at":"2023-11-23T11:54:53Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T00:13:06Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T00:13:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b62e88974b11dda8b2558ffd3ac8c654f4bc837","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8b58201b13591378aed57c9f957145497bf1e969","head":{"label":"oxsean:fix-13299-license-scan-failed","ref":"fix-13299-license-scan-failed","sha":"8b58201b13591378aed57c9f957145497bf1e969","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-07T03:37:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T02:14:18Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T02:14:18Z","merged_at":"2023-11-20T02:14:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"43e78d1298ffbe878a8742a752fd8e70d573ab7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f05633e090154704761fd7d4a559f13e449b6888","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1107-lgos","ref":"1107-lgos","sha":"f05633e090154704761fd7d4a559f13e449b6888","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-06T12:10:52Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T12:13:13Z","closed_at":"2023-11-06T12:13:13Z","merged_at":"2023-11-06T12:13:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1ed5ca3823d9f3120627d1893cfa5cb90d7142a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/eef824079e9ba914ad3fb31e7ead0739067ab7c8","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/exclude_spotless_license","ref":"fix/exclude_spotless_license","sha":"eef824079e9ba914ad3fb31e7ead0739067ab7c8","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-06T11:34:21Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T12:20:29Z","closed_at":"2023-11-06T12:14:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e15713bf991167c99abde332bcd90cac414035c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e589d68a09b642e210237340feac9152bd1a596f","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/3.2_formatted_code","ref":"feat/3.2_formatted_code","sha":"e589d68a09b642e210237340feac9152bd1a596f","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-06T05:57:39Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T07:43:21Z","closed_at":"2023-11-06T06:04:47Z","merged_at":"2023-11-06T06:04:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"e155591adb242e311f5802e07bdc2b6038dbe94c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/65c337ca2bb57c47a72f01b89199a409e3bbd59c","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/rest_compiler_failure","ref":"fix/rest_compiler_failure","sha":"65c337ca2bb57c47a72f01b89199a409e3bbd59c","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-03T07:15:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T13:21:49Z","closed_at":"2023-12-20T13:21:49Z","merged_at":"2023-12-20T13:21:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"9df0d154a5ff77de6572dce30cf8fb0f6d08963a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6338d308316f60f61b9169b3ff86df30bc017f6e","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-customize-registry-parameters","ref":"3.2-customize-registry-parameters","sha":"6338d308316f60f61b9169b3ff86df30bc017f6e","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nSee #13299\r\nEnhance spring boot configuration metadata\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. Enhance comments in relevant configuration classes by ChatGPT.\r\n2. Create the module dubbo-spring-boot-configuration-metadata-compatible for generating metadata.\r\n3. Adjust dubbo-spring-boot-autoconfigure-compatible to using the generated spring-configuration-metadata.json.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nConfiguration beans of dubbo are located in the dubbo-common module, and it's not suitable to add spring boot dependencies.\r\nHowever, spring configuration metadata generation relies on read javadoc from the source code and cannot use the @NestedConfigurationProperty annotation.\r\nThis leads to missing comments and a lack of nested configuration options. Therefore, we use an independent module to copy the code and generate metadata.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-01T12:51:16Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T13:53:17Z","closed_at":"2023-11-02T01:52:31Z","merged_at":"2023-11-02T01:52:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"c22a40b87d8d3f06ce9cbb180db8e5314fe377d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8b4a86c7f930e20cf440df5dde8d5729203b34ec","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1101-nashorn","ref":"1101-nashorn","sha":"8b4a86c7f930e20cf440df5dde8d5729203b34ec","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-30T16:35:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T13:37:58Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T12:33:53Z","merged_at":"2023-11-01T12:33:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"46741b6c16bf69a44ac9e4ad5ed878a6e9ea55de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e916ed438d7c044b0e375a0a46bdbcde7d216c24","head":{"label":"Linchen-Xu:rm-unu-meth-scope-bean-fcty","ref":"rm-unu-meth-scope-bean-fcty","sha":"e916ed438d7c044b0e375a0a46bdbcde7d216c24","user":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693248002,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVIgAg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Linchen-Xu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-30T11:26:56Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T12:27:04Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T12:27:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"938e712e547f059d6f1f45ac3855a1473715285c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec0a9cae3c554c08cfff0bf2d7556cb21615d919","head":{"label":"caoyanan666:fix-3.0-issues/13286","ref":"fix-3.0-issues/13286","sha":"ec0a9cae3c554c08cfff0bf2d7556cb21615d919","user":{"login":"caoyanan666","id":55247691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQ3Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55247691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666","html_url":"https://github.com/caoyanan666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caoyanan666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"fce97fdc8a016fa6945636c37b44df01ea030cb0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-30T08:08:52Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T11:03:31Z","closed_at":"2023-10-30T11:03:31Z","merged_at":"2023-10-30T11:03:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f635de7ba26c7b2d266c9c2cdcc4e982fa5928f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4835f0afcfd0a9c84ba437996196682a37bed8a3","head":{"label":"oxsean:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"4835f0afcfd0a9c84ba437996196682a37bed8a3","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-30T02:55:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T11:16:19Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T11:16:19Z","merged_at":"2023-11-01T11:16:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"06e9410f6873f28db11bc0bec7823f9f3228df53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13277/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13277/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13277/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/629e1e593f23e4dfdd7bb0829bd6447949cc863b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1030-sync","ref":"1030-sync","sha":"629e1e593f23e4dfdd7bb0829bd6447949cc863b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-29T14:54:59Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T03:13:58Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T03:13:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"366ea28ab98920edf28827876a1d5246af4887d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6194b43a8714917bd05dc901c95f7b558b9a9142","head":{"label":"LINGLUOJUN:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"6194b43a8714917bd05dc901c95f7b558b9a9142","user":{"login":"LINGLUOJUN","id":16778977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzc4OTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16778977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN","html_url":"https://github.com/LINGLUOJUN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":711508604,"node_id":"R_kgDOKmjCfA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LINGLUOJUN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LINGLUOJUN","id":16778977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzc4OTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16778977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN","html_url":"https://github.com/LINGLUOJUN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LINGLUOJUN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LINGLUOJUN/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-28T05:52:01Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T12:07:22Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T12:07:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"113cae508f7f16202b3f583e26779c7a784221ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c9f2530f5aa845fd5a888e24c13ceceba5baecbd","head":{"label":"Liuhp534:fix-consul-registry","ref":"fix-consul-registry","sha":"c9f2530f5aa845fd5a888e24c13ceceba5baecbd","user":{"login":"Liuhp534","id":44354568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzU0NTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44354568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534","html_url":"https://github.com/Liuhp534","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":709801223,"node_id":"R_kgDOKk61Bw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Liuhp534/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Liuhp534","id":44354568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzU0NTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44354568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534","html_url":"https://github.com/Liuhp534","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liuhp534/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Liuhp534/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-27T07:07:03Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T12:04:31Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T12:04:31Z","merged_at":"2023-11-01T12:04:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a6dbbe2ca3ddf3aa156016f2f734c10eb281f00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1342ebff65824ca605b812ba9dd64bb8b0a4fa95","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-judge-qos-started","ref":"3.2-judge-qos-started","sha":"1342ebff65824ca605b812ba9dd64bb8b0a4fa95","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

`AwaitingNonWebApplicationListenerTest` because no tests can be found in it.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nRun `org.apache.dubbo.spring.boot.TestSuite`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-25T14:53:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T11:09:12Z","closed_at":"2023-11-14T11:09:12Z","merged_at":"2023-11-14T11:09:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c3e592ebb01be108e4794bf2e8194ecafe0bced","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13267/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13267/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13267/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/89768443b4cf8d5c9ba182da77eae9a96c2fd211","head":{"label":"Linchen-Xu:opt-dubbo-test-suite","ref":"opt-dubbo-test-suite","sha":"89768443b4cf8d5c9ba182da77eae9a96c2fd211","user":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693248002,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVIgAg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Linchen-Xu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-25T06:23:35Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T13:35:48Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T06:00:28Z","merged_at":"2023-10-26T06:00:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba94cf0b1719f74719a4e3263f072719d0353644","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cd03e226f839b0ac29726d23b5a7810795731eed","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/move_dubbo_compiler","ref":"feat/move_dubbo_compiler","sha":"cd03e226f839b0ac29726d23b5a7810795731eed","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

<code>AbstractManagedChannelImplBuilder</code> and <code>AbstractServerImplBuilder</code> are removed (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10530\">#10530</a>). This is ABI-breaking, see the warning above.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nWhen trying to run a dubbo native application using nacos as the registry centre, the native image cannot run successfully since the reflection metadata of nacos is missing. This pr adds support for running native image when using nacos as the registry centre.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nUse the tracing agent to capture the reflection metadata required by a dubbo project using nacos as a registry centre. Add the reflection metadata to dubbo-nacos-registry to help dubbo users run their images successfully.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-22T10:21:47Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T08:49:18Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T08:49:18Z","merged_at":"2023-10-26T08:49:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"9681515f189dd1d3440eeb1a2b1f1f5c7b83c41c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e3fd17accda6cb8c9b12ef42f285fd1c25492fc0","head":{"label":"chaicho:support_native_nacos_registry","ref":"support_native_nacos_registry","sha":"e3fd17accda6cb8c9b12ef42f285fd1c25492fc0","user":{"login":"chaicho","id":55324126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzI0MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55324126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho","html_url":"https://github.com/chaicho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":644373324,"node_id":"R_kgDOJmhbTA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"chaicho/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chaicho","id":55324126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzI0MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55324126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho","html_url":"https://github.com/chaicho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaicho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chaicho/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\noptimize AbstractConfigTest\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\norg.apache.dubbo.config.AbstractConfigTest\r\n\r\n- Rewrite `testAppendProperties` related tests because `AbstractConfig.appendProperties` no longer exists.\r\n- Remove unused inner test class `PropertiesConfig`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-20T14:24:42Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T03:10:26Z","closed_at":"2023-10-23T03:10:26Z","merged_at":"2023-10-23T03:10:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad26a69d8225fd786900a10ab717f2cb4e7eec48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/943caf5d1057055219ea87e93bb79e2eb361ad87","head":{"label":"Linchen-Xu:opt-abs-conf-test","ref":"opt-abs-conf-test","sha":"943caf5d1057055219ea87e93bb79e2eb361ad87","user":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693248002,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVIgAg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Linchen-Xu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

The original 100 valid nodes received an event: 80 valid nodes offline, 20/100 less than the threshold of 0.3, discarding this change\r\n2. The original 100 valid nodes have received an event: 50 valid nodes offline, with 50/100 exceeding the threshold of 0.3. Process this change\r\n3. There are 100 original nodes, including 50 valid nodes and 50 unavailable nodes. Received event: 80 offline nodes (40 valid nodes+40 unavailable nodes), with 10/50 less than the threshold of 0.3. Discard this change\r\n4. There are 100 original nodes, including 50 valid nodes and 50 unavailable nodes. Received event: 80 offline nodes (30 valid nodes+50 unavailable nodes), 20/50 is greater than the threshold of 0.3. Process this change\r\n5. There are 100 original nodes, including 50 valid nodes and 50 unavailable nodes. Received event: 50 offline nodes (50 valid nodes), 0/50 is less than the threshold of 0.3, discard this change\r\n6.

Process this change\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n1. Provider publishing or scaling requires mass publishing, and the threshold will be lower than the normal threshold\r\n\r\n> - It is necessary to have all upstream users change the threshold for this appkey\r\n\r\n2. Due to the special nature of the business, the consumer service needs to adjust the threshold, such as the core service wanting to adjust the threshold higher to ensure the success rate of the call\r\n\r\n> - It is necessary to change the default threshold for all appkeys in this service\r\n\r\nPriority: provider>consumer>default\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nAfter the registration center recovers from a failure, all temporary nodes will be re registered, and a smaller number of nodes will be pushed to the consumer (such as events for one node or two nodes). If the consumer refreshes the list, it will result in only a few nodes receiving traffic, and in high traffic situations, a large number of reject exceptions will occur, causing traffic loss\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-20T03:44:14Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T12:07:05Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T12:07:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d094a4af164d0538c00350fe490d92b6d806fc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b72f6d2942709ea01272c6be4fca4804cf477247","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-threshold-of-instance-changed","ref":"3.2-threshold-of-instance-changed","sha":"b72f6d2942709ea01272c6be4fca4804cf477247","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-19T12:54:33Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T07:31:35Z","closed_at":"2023-10-20T07:31:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e0191f5ba9181c75ed62c8c53abfcf51e64700a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/efbd163d7363a89a3c8f16a4aea87dd887e2d3b0","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1019-copy","ref":"1019-copy","sha":"efbd163d7363a89a3c8f16a4aea87dd887e2d3b0","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nOptimize code in MethodConfigTest, and add a new test.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Remove unnecessary exception throw code\r\n- Add the `convertMethodConfig2AsyncInfo` test in the `MethodConfigTest` class in `dubbo-config-api` module, which was added in `dubbo-compatible` module.\r\n- The `MethodConfigTest` class in the `dubbo-compatible` module should test `MethodConfig` class in `com.alibaba.dubbo.config` package instead of the class with the same name in `org.apache.dubbo.config` package, which is tested in another test class.\r\n- Remove the unnecessary manual cast from String type to Object type when calling `assertEquals` and `assertThat`, the type erasure mechanism will do it (the matcher will eventually be treated as `Matcher<Map>` instead of `Matcher<Map<Object, Object>>`).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nrun both MethodConfigTest.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-19T06:33:17Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T07:41:32Z","closed_at":"2023-10-20T07:41:32Z","merged_at":"2023-10-20T07:41:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"b41fe3ca355f06281efdb396a5a527e3f74a687d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/aace383e3ae60f72aab35f8c03bd55704a696c0a","head":{"label":"Linchen-Xu:refact-method-conf-test","ref":"refact-method-conf-test","sha":"aace383e3ae60f72aab35f8c03bd55704a696c0a","user":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693248002,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVIgAg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Linchen-Xu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Linchen-Xu","id":22527265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI3MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22527265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linchen-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Linchen-Xu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Verifying this change\r\nCompile successfully with jdk 1.8\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-17T16:46:19Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T13:34:50Z","closed_at":"2023-10-18T08:38:46Z","merged_at":"2023-10-18T08:38:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7696e1b42c03398cfebca29885871a422f6bd521","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13227/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13227/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13227/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8539ace4010ca61fe5d7a14b3dfddbad867e0c67","head":{"label":"oxsean:bugfix-13226-support-jdk-1.8","ref":"bugfix-13226-support-jdk-1.8","sha":"8539ace4010ca61fe5d7a14b3dfddbad867e0c67","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-17T09:53:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T03:39:33Z","closed_at":"2023-10-18T03:39:33Z","merged_at":"2023-10-18T03:39:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"f995ef506c2e3306f9cbcd4bc33ad169a3da0b7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5922499dcd7eba8ed8851788911fefa80733a61d","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1017-fix-tri","ref":"1017-fix-tri","sha":"5922499dcd7eba8ed8851788911fefa80733a61d","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

They can only get the wrong retrun types form the async `StubMethodDescriptor`, usually the `CompletableFuture.class`.\r\n*  Issue https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/13158\r\n*  Issue https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/10910\r\n\r\n\r\n**Detail:**\r\nCurrently, `Dubbo3TripleGenerator` will gererate 2 `StubMethodDescriptor` for each non-streaming method, one for sync call, the other for async call, and they share same method name.\r\n```Java\r\n//They have same name \r\n    private static final StubMethodDescriptor greetMethod = new StubMethodDescriptor(\"greet\",\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterRequest.class, org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterReply.class, serviceDescriptor, MethodDescriptor.RpcType.UNARY,\r\n    obj -> ((Message) obj).toByteArray(), obj -> ((Message) obj).toByteArray(), org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterRequest::parseFrom,\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterReply::parseFrom);\r\n\r\n    private static final StubMethodDescriptor greetAsyncMethod = new StubMethodDescriptor(\"greet\",\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterRequest.class, java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.class, serviceDescriptor, MethodDescriptor.RpcType.UNARY,\r\n    obj -> ((Message) obj).toByteArray(), obj -> ((Message) obj).toByteArray(), org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterRequest::parseFrom,\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.samples.tri.grpc.GreeterReply::parseFrom);\r\n```\r\n\r\nStubMethodDescriptor will add itself to `StubServiceDescriptor` when initialize:\r\n```Java\r\n  public StubMethodDescriptor(String methodName, Class<?> requestClass, Class<?> responseClass, StubServiceDescriptor serviceDescriptor, MethodDescriptor.RpcType rpcType, Pack requestPack, Pack responsePack, UnPack requestUnpack, UnPack responseUnpack) {\r\n      //...\r\n        serviceDescriptor.addMethod(this);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd obviously only the last one will be stored into  `StubServiceDescriptor`:\r\n```Java\r\n    public void addMethod(MethodDescriptor methodDescriptor) {\r\n        //use method name as key\r\n        this.methods.put( methodDescriptor.getMethodName(), Collections.singletonList(methodDescriptor));\r\n        Map<String, MethodDescriptor> descMap = (Map)this.descToMethods.computeIfAbsent(methodDescriptor.getMethodName(), (k) -> {\r\n            return new HashMap();\r\n        });\r\n        descMap.put(methodDescriptor.getParamDesc(), methodDescriptor);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy `StubMethodDescriptor.returnClass`  is correct?\r\nSome one provded a temporary fix in `StubInvocationUtil`:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/100946116/5ee7c663-5cd6-47ba-86ca-a5b925ecdcf9)\r\nBut the `returnTypes` for `RpcInvocation` are still wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThis PR make the async version `StubMethodDescriptor` declared before the sync version. It can make the sync version of `StubMethodDescriptor` override the async one in `StubServiceDescriptor`,  and provides the ture retrun types when `RpcInvocation` initialize. \r\nThen, for the async call, `StubInvocationUtil` will set `returnTypes[0]` to `CompletableFuture`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-17T09:35:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-26T09:38:13Z","closed_at":"2023-12-26T09:38:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c82cb472d7a8e38c334a02c52c8cf4696ca1db8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/01b6e324c0ec2900987aa1b2ecab083bd0b4b51d","head":{"label":"namelessssssssssss:fix_method_descriptor_cover","ref":"fix_method_descriptor_cover","sha":"01b6e324c0ec2900987aa1b2ecab083bd0b4b51d","user":{"login":"namelessssssssssss","id":100946116,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgRQxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100946116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss","html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":616260320,"node_id":"R_kgDOJLti4A","name":"dubbo-core","full_name":"namelessssssssssss/dubbo-core","private":false,"owner":{"login":"namelessssssssssss","id":100946116,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgRQxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100946116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss","html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss/dubbo-core","description":"Apache
