Description\r\n\r\nAs of now, it is possible to override the virtual router service offering with global, domain, and account level configurations. What if a customer wants to change the service offering for only one network? There isn't such an option in Cloudstack. As an admin, you can only override the network offering for a domain, account, or global, affecting all the networks in that domain, account, or zone. This pull request aims to add a network-level setting to override the virtual router service offering per network.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nTo test this feature, please follow the below steps:\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nSupport of `iothreads` and IO driver policy (native, threads, io_uring) for a Virtual machine on KVM hypervisors.\r\nBoth options are available on the deployment of a VM or could be set later from the VM's settings. Also, both options - `iothreads` and IO policy could be used separately. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51903378/212874968-3208b88e-4bff-4651-8f97-301351cd9b7b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `iothreads` option, by default, uses one thread. You can set the number of threads in the `agent.properties` file with the parameter `iothreads`. If the `iothreads` is enabled for the VM and no IO driver policy is defined, will be set `io=threads` as default for `io`.\r\n\r\nIO driver policy could be `native`, `io_uring` or `threads`.\r\nThe admins could decide for each storage pool which IO policy to be used - threads, native, io_uring. This can be set from the primary storage setting `kvm.storage.pool.io.policy`.  To use this functionality when deploying a new VM, you have to choose the `storage_specific` option for the IO driver policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nPR #5375, introduced in version 4.15.2.0, removed parameter `%any` of VPNs client-to-site (C2S) IPSec secrets:\r\n- structure before PR #5375:\r\n  `<IP> %any : PSK \"<PSK>\"`\r\n- structure after PR #5375:\r\n  `<IP> : PSK \"<PSK>\"`\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of that, when a VPN site-so-site (S2S) is created in parallel to a VPN C2S in the same network, the C2S will not handle any IP (`%any`) anymore and, as the network is being tunneled to the other VPN, the connection will be handled by the final peer. This way, when a VPN S2S is created in parallel to a VPN C2S in the same network, it is only possible to connect to the C2S with the S2S PSK.\r\n\r\nAs ACS is only able to implement a single C2S per network (ACS allows setting more than one IP of the network as VPN, however, only the first will be implemented) and every S2S has its own secret file, the secrets structure of C2S was changed to contain only the PSK:\r\n```\r\n: PSK \"<PSK>\"\r\n```\r\n By doing that, StrongSwan will handle correctly C2S connections from any IP and still will use the correct PSK for S2S.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created 3 networks (A, B, and C) and a VM in each network. In networks B and C I enabled the VPN. From VM in network A, I configured both VPNs and successfully connected to them with their respective PSK. Then, from B to C I established a S2S VPN. Without this change, when I was trying to connect again to C2S B with B PSK, the connection was refused; however, when tried to connect to C2S B with C PSK, the connection was successful. After the changes, I tried to connect again to C2S B with B PSK and the connection was successful.","created_at":"2022-11-17T14:34:49Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T12:59:06Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T12:59:05Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T12:59:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf32f77e3dedfc75ea89278aacaaef89537f5d8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073184,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:XenServer","name":"component:XenServer","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073391,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:virtual-router","name":"component:virtual-router","color":"ffaaeb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThe tests below in `NeutronNetworkAdapterTest.java`, `NeutronNodeAdapterTest.java` and `NeutronPortAdapterTest.java` were found flaky because of the ordering of JSON objects. The orders of elements in the JSON objects were not the same every time the test being called. In this case, JsonParser from Gson was applied to ensure the orders do not cause the flakiness. This code change is trying to fix the [flaky tests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/flaky_tests.html) mentioned above, because they sometimes fail (as the picture showed) and sometimes pass. The failure could be reproduced by the commands below by using the tool of [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex). The code change is to make sure the tests will always pass in this case.\r\n\r\n- `org.apache.cloudstack.network.opendaylight.api.test.NeutronNetworkAdapterTest.gsonNeutronNetworkMarshalingTest`\r\n-

Description\r\n\r\nPart of script `ssvm-check.sh` checks if the secondary storage is mounted on the SSVM. If it is not mounted, it tries to ping the \"NFS server\"; This process infers that the \"NFS server\" is the seventeenth element of file `/var/cache/cloud/cmdline`; however, the index of the elements can vary according to some configurations (vide `SecondaryStorageManagerImpl#finalizeVirtualMachineProfile`). For instance, in https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6348#issuecomment-1310020312 it is trying to ping the netmask. Futhermore, we do not have the information of the NSF server in the `/var/cache/cloud/cmdline` file.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix the check by adding the secondary storage server address to the file and retrieving it by the name. If the property is not in the file, it tries to validate the storage gateway to mitigate the \"storage not mounted\" situation.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature

Description\r\n\r\nVOLUME.DETACH, created during VM removal, has type VirtualMachine instead of Volume and has \"Vm Id: XXX\" in the description.\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create Volume\r\n2. Create VM\r\n3. Attach Volume to VM\r\n4. Delete VM\r\n5. Check Volume events page, VOLUME.DETACH is missing there\r\n6. Check Events page, VOLUME.DETACH available, but has description \"Vm Id: XXX\" and resource is VM instead of Volume\r\n\r\nThe root cause: @actionevent uses CallContext information for event details, and in this case CallContext contains VM information.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing

Description\r\n\r\nFix: #6203 \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces JUnit Assume API to the five test cases of `CABackgroundTaskTest`:\r\n[`testNullCert`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/4c5a2ba3a6eb6399390c2f8963cb26e0e35fc058/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/ca/CABackgroundTaskTest.java#L94-L99), [`testNullHost`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/4c5a2ba3a6eb6399390c2f8963cb26e0e35fc058/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/ca/CABackgroundTaskTest.java#L102-L108), [`testAutoRenewalEnabledWithExceptionsOnProvisioning`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/ca/CABackgroundTaskTest.java#L122), [`testAutoRenewalEnabledWithNoExceptionsOnProvisioning`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/ca/CABackgroundTaskTest.java#L111) , and [`testAutoRenewalDisabled`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/ca/CABackgroundTaskTest.java#L134).\r\n\r\nTake [`testAutoRenewalDisabled`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/ca/CABackgroundTaskTest.java#L134) as a example:\r\n\r\nRight now this case is asserting `certMap.size() == 1` before the actual testing target(`task.runInContext()`) is executed. \r\n\r\n```java\r\ncertMap.put(hostIp, expiredCertificate);\r\nAssert.assertTrue(certMap.size() == 1);\r\n```\r\nSince the test case `testAutoRenewalDisabled` contains 2 assertions, it may fail due to 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n  * The functions related to the `certMap` have bugs.(Here is the `Assert.assertTrue(certMap.size() == 1)`)\r\n  * The function `task.runInContext()` have bugs.(What we actually want to check with this test)\r\n\r\nHere I suggest replacing the `assertTrue` function with the `assumeThat` function, so when the precondition fails, JUnit can skip it instead of report a failurel.  This can help us to focus on failure that is raised by the target testing function.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Before refactoring**\r\n```java\r\ncertMap.put(hostIp, expiredCertificate);\r\nAssert.assertTrue(certMap.size() == 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After refactoring**\r\n```java\r\ncertMap.put(hostIp, expiredCertificate);\r\nAssume.assumeThat(icertMap.size() == 1, is(true));\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Brief changelog\r\nReplace `Assert.assertTrue(certMap.size() == 1);` with `Assume.assumeThat(icertMap.size() == 1, is(true));` for better code comprehension.\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nFix: #6660 \r\n\r\nThis PR Simplify the test case [`ApplicationLoadBalancerTest.searchForNonExistingLoadBalancer`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/ddb11b1b966cc2b3443ef4d2eeb55c1d64ff3fb9/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/lb/ApplicationLoadBalancerTest.java#L189-L205) and try to imporve its readability.\r\n\r\nThe test case checks that when retrieving a non-existing lb, an InvalidParameterValueException should be raised. However, the intention is not explicit in the current implementation of the test case. See below the current implementation:\r\n\r\n**Before Refactoring**\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    //Negative test - try to retrieve non-existing lb\r\n    public void searchForNonExistingLoadBalancer() {\r\n        boolean notFound = false;\r\n        ApplicationLoadBalancerRule rule = null;\r\n        try {\r\n            rule = _appLbSvc.getApplicationLoadBalancer(nonExistingLbId);\r\n            if (rule != null) {\r\n                notFound = false;\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (InvalidParameterValueException ex) {\r\n            notFound = true;\r\n        }\r\n        assertTrue(\"Found non-existing load balancer; no invalid parameter value exception was thrown\", notFound);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe test case relies on a parameter named notFound, being asserted in line [204](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/ddb11b1b966cc2b3443ef4d2eeb55c1d64ff3fb9/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/lb/ApplicationLoadBalancerTest.java#L204), and a try-catch block with if condition between lines [195 to 204](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/ddb11b1b966cc2b3443ef4d2eeb55c1d64ff3fb9/server/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/lb/ApplicationLoadBalancerTest.java#L195-#L204) to achieve the testing goal. It can be simplified to 4 lines with a more explicit intention for easy understanding, as follows:\r\n\r\n**After refactoring**\r\n```java\r\n@Test(expected=InvalidParameterValueException.class)\r\n //Negative test - try to retrieve non-existing lb\r\npublic void searchForNonExistingLoadBalancer() throws InvalidParameterValueException {\r\n   _appLbSvc.getApplicationLoadBalancer(nonExistingLbId));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nFor more description details, please refer to the issue #6660.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nThe tests below in `ReflectionToStringBuilderUtilsTest.java` and `SMTPMailSenderTest.java` were found flaky because of the ordering of HashSet and result Arrays. The orders of elements in the HashSet and result Arrays are not the same every time the test being called. In this case, LinkedHashSet was applied and Arrays were sorted to ensure the orders do not cause the flakiness. This code change is trying to fix the [flaky tests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/flaky_tests.html) mentioned above, because they sometimes fail (as the picture showed) and sometimes pass. The failure could be reproduced by the commands below by using the tool of [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex). The code change is to make sure the tests will always pass in this case.\r\n\r\n- `org.apache.cloudstack.utils.mailing.SMTPMailSenderTest.setMailRecipientsTest`\r\n-

fine.","created_at":"2022-11-03T16:22:54Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T09:09:32Z","closed_at":"2022-12-20T13:53:54Z","merged_at":"2022-12-20T13:53:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"440d7805cbccba36b619913d66165afb456f6469","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/504e267767e707f01107607f7c7ed0ba52709c98","head":{"label":"scclouds:UI-create-cidr-field-for-load-balancer-rules","ref":"UI-create-cidr-field-for-load-balancer-rules","sha":"504e267767e707f01107607f7c7ed0ba52709c98","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nWhen a user removes a VM, ACS puts it in a `Destroy` state and stops counting it towards the user resource limit. However, the VM root volume remains in `Ready` state and consuming resources until the VM cleanup task runs on ACS. \r\n\r\nThe `destroy.root.volume.on.vm.destruction` setting was created so that when it is set to true, when destroying a VM its root volume will also be placed in the `Destroy` state, no longer counting towards the user resource limit.\r\n\r\nAlso, while this setting is active, root volumes in the destroy state will not be removed by the ACS volume cleanup task, so that it is possible to restore the VM again. However, the VM cleanup task will still remove the VMs along with their respective volumes.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab.\r\n| N | Test | Result |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n|1| With the setting disabled, a VM was destroyed | the VM was in `Destroy` state and its root volume in `Ready` |\r\n|2| With the setting enabled, a VM was destroyed | the VM was in `Destroy` state and its root volume in `Destroy` too |\r\n|3| With the setting enabled, the test 2 VM was restored | The VM was correctly restored along with its root volume |\r\n|4| Test 1 VM was restored | The VM was correctly restored |\r\n|5| With the setting enabled, the test 3 VM was destroyed, its volume restored, and then the VM restored | When the volume was restored, it became `DATADISK` type (since it is detached when being recovered), then the VM was restored, the volume was

Description\r\n\r\nThere are some networking setups where system VM communications are proxied off of the hypervisor host on which the system VM is running. For example, if the KVM management network is a NAT bridge, or the network plugin employs user mode network for system VM management interfaces, then system VM agent comms look as though they come form the hypervisor host. Admittedly, these configurations are bespoke, which is why a configuration is provided and it's disabled by default.\r\n\r\nIn such a setup, the certificate authentication for agents fails because the source IP is that of the host of the system VM, rather than the system VM itself, and this IP is not in the connecting certificate presented. This PR adds a configuration value that allows the system VM cert to contain the host IP that the system VM is scheduled on. This allows such setups to maintain auth strictness on agent auth.\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested this via unit tests, and in our private integration environment.

Description\r\n\r\nPR #4819 removed the VM password regeneration when assigning a new SSH key pair to the VM. However, there is a message in the UI warning the user that the root's password will be changed after the reset of the SSH Key Pair.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two VM affinity groups\r\n\r\n- Non-strict host affinity\r\n- Non-strict host anti-affinity\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new parameter `considerlasthost` to startVirtualMachine API.\r\n\r\n- if `considerlasthost` is false, CloudStack will not consider the last host and start the VM by normal process.\r\n- `considerlasthost` is true by default, CloudStack will try to start the VM on the last host where it run if destination host is not specified.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!--

was exploring to set up CloudStack env on a Rocky 9 or RHEL9 (no-cost subscription) and started this PR. (Also exploring setting up a new docker container image https://hub.docker.com/r/shapeblue/rocky9-cloudstack-builder and backend jenkins job \"acs-el9-pkg-builder\")\r\nFixes: #6651 \r\nTODOs:\r\n- [x] Migrate git-pr to python3 on main branch (and fix the el9 jenkins job hack) https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6961\r\n- [x] EL9 packaging job\r\n- [x] EL9 mgmt server support with MySQL\r\n- [x] EL9 usage server support\r\n- [x] EL9 KVM support (works see notes below)\r\n~~- [ ] Consolidate EL9 pkging with EL8 using boolean conditionals~~ (due to Python site-path change, it may not be possible to do it correctly?)\r\n- [x] Add EL9/Rocky9 template support in Trilian/BO\r\n- [x] Run a round of smoketests with EL9 as both kvm and mgmt server host (I expect/hope this to pass)\r\n\r\nFor EL9 KVM to work with cloudstack-agent, I had to remove the systemd service dependency on libvirtd and follow the guide to switch to modular daemon (perhaps using the old/monolithic way could work, but it didn't in my case):\r\nhttps://libvirt.org/daemons.html#monolithic-vs-modular-daemons\r\n\r\nAfter switching completely to modular daemons, I had to ensure that virtqemud was running with --listen, symlink the /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf -> /etc/libvirt/virtqemud.conf and start this:\r\n```\r\nsystemctl start virtproxyd-tls.socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: there are no network-scripts now; so after fixing cloudbr0 etc we need to only restart NetworkManager. Rest all seems to work.\r\n\r\nMisc notes, perhaps this isn't necessary but I did that as I was in a double nested env already:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@rocky9-kvm etc]# cat

Description\r\n\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/296\r\n\r\nEdge zones will be light-weight advanced zones, typically with a single hypervisor host.\r\nCurrently, supported only for KVM hypervisor due to direct-download template requirement.\r\nhttps://events.hubilo.com/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022/session/172619\r\n\r\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/ShapeBlue/edge-zones-in-cloudstack\r\n\r\nSupported functionalities and characteristics of an edge zone in the current iteration:\r\n- VM operations - all VM operations except those that rely on shared storage and console access which need CPVM\r\n- Access to the whole compute resource. CPVM and SSVM won't be present\r\n- Networking models - L2 and shared\r\n- Direct-download templates\r\n- Use of local storage\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-21T06:38:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T11:30:25Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T08:36:46Z","merged_at":"2023-01-31T08:36:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b6ce9709718f6b261a9d9f601a1917142256abb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073307,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:secondary-storage","name":"component:secondary-storage","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073351,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vpc","name":"component:vpc","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073449,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM0NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:ssvm","name":"component:ssvm","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a NPE that occurs when trying to create a volume from a snapshot. This happens because when trying to log the `virtualMachineProfile` in the `AbstractStoragePoolAllocator#logStartOfSearch` method, its `toString()` method will throw a NPE since the `_vm` attribute is null.\r\n\r\nSome `toString()`s were also created in classes that had objects being logged during the volume creation process, as they were being logged as memory addresses since they had no `toString()` implementation.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab, before this patch every time I tried to create a volume from a snapshot, a NPE was thrown.

migrate unattached volumes without going through secondary storage.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n* A XenAPI Plugin for live migrating unattached disks across storage pools\r\n* An optional change on how detached volumes are migrated across xcp-ng/xenserver storage pools\r\n\r\nWhen attaching a volume to a virtual machine belonging to a remote storage pool or when moving volumes from one storage pool to another, the VDI is first copied to the secondary storage and then from secondary storage to the destination storage pool, which can be very long when migrating large volumes.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, volumes can be live migrated (StorageXenMotion) by attaching them to a temporary transport VM.\r\nA small transport vm (without OS) is created and the volume is attached to it. Thus, the volume can be moved by live migrating the transport vm to the destination cluster.\r\n\r\nA new global setting`xen.live.migrate.unattached.volumes` has been added to indicate whether to activate the plugin or not.\r\n\r\nThe module itself can be used standalone as below:\r\n~~~\r\nxe host-call-plugin host-uuid=931581a4-a73f-4842-a29c-ddd3d33344c3 plugin=migrate-unattached-disk fn=migrate_vdi args:local_vdi_uuid=0cfe7d80-1486-419d-8142-51e0e57eba9a args:remote_host=host01.mydomain.net args:remote_username=root args:remote_password=s3cur3d args:remote_sr_uuid=1c5fb76\r\n4-6e70-e6f1-0be4-024a352e3a57 args:network_uuid=0dd16d73-df9d-0452-15b3-80be6f150042 args:dest_host_uuid=693ca0ee-517b-4710-9a7e-ce70df3a11d7 args:protocol='https'\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nThe feature has been running for several months on Cloudstack 4.13.1/4.16.1 + XenServer 7.1 in production.\r\nThe module, which relied on the xenserver-transfer-vm package which was removed from xcp 8.2.1, has just been rewritten to work on xcp/xenserver 8.2.1. It was manually tested on Cloudstack 4.16.1 / xcp-ng 8.2.1.\r\nI currently don't have an environment available to test with the main branch.\r\n\r\ncc @ArthurHlt

Description\r\n\r\nACS encrypts the configuration values from accounts and domains, e.g. `AccountDetailVO` and `DomainDetailVO` while plain values are stored in the DB on data center and cluster scopes, e.g. `DataCenterDetailVO` and `ClusterDetailVO`. However, there are many different configuration values that make no sense to encrypt. The only ones that should be encrypted are in the secure/hidden category. Furthermore, there are use cases when retrieving the value on a DB view is needed, which is impossible with the current process in the account and domain scopes. Moreover, the response while updating a configuration value now returns the encrypted value for the categories mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to normalize the encryption on these four scopes; for this, all values that are not in the secure/hidden category are not encrypted. Furthermore, an unused mock file was removed due to a requirement to add a mock method to this class that was not even used.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nDomain details table before changes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/194645900-2f984164-0ebc-4294-bc2e-5580880ccbaf.png)\r\n\r\nDomain details table after changes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/194645892-7d0804c8-191c-4ba5-80aa-2c3faa588e3b.png)\r\n\r\nUpdate configuration value response after these changes:  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/194647333-abe627ee-9a64-4c31-9978-b872c17b6bba.png)\r\n\r\nThese images are just an example, these changes are for all four tables mentioned above.\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested in a local lab generating a new version for the `.deb` file of CloudStack.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the configuration `consoleproxy.url.domain` only accepts domain names as a valid value; however, some users have reported the desire to use private IPs as a value for this configuration. This is useful for CI implementation and local labs.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this PR is to allow operators to use IPs as valid configurations as well.\r\n\r\nThe validations for the configuration values have also been refactored into new methods to facilitate unity tests and clean up the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause

Description\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/294\r\n\r\nThis PR improves resource metrics/stats visualization functionality.\r\nIt allows stats for:\r\n**System VMs**\r\nPersisting and showing stats for system VMs. New API - `listSystemVmsUsageHistory` has been added to support this. SSVM, CPVM and VRs now show `Metrics` tab similar to user VMs. System VM stats will be stored in the existing DB table `cloud.vm_stats` and will use the same cleanup mechanism as the user VMs. To control storing system VM stats a new global setting has been added,\r\n`vm.stats.user.vm.only` - When set to 'false' stats for system VMs will be collected otherwise stats collection will be done only for user VMs. The default value is 'false'\r\n\r\n**VM Disks**\r\nPersisting and showing stats for VM disks. New API - `listVolumesUsageHistory` has been added to support this. Volumes attached to a running user VM show the `Metrics` tab. VM disks stats will be stored in a new DB table `cloud.volume_stats`. To control storing VM disk stats two new global setting have been added,\r\n`vm.disk.stats.retention.enabled` - When set to 'true' stats for VM disks will be stored in the database otherwise disk stats will not be stored.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR renames the method `validateUUID` to `isUuid` and everywhere it's called.\r\n\r\nThe current name of the method (`validateUUID`) gives the impression that if the validation fails, an exception will be thrown, when in fact it just returns a boolean value, and that's why I think that `isUuid` is more appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug

Description\r\nWhen adding a KVM host via ACS UI, it is necessary to provide a username and password for ACS to connect via SSH to the host. When using the `updateHostPassword` API, ACS updates the password in the metadata. When the update_passwd_on_host parameter is specified as true, ACS sends a command to the host that causes it to run a script to change the user's password on the host.\r\n\r\nDuring some internal tests, it was observed that the script was not changing the password and returned an error.

same traffic types with null tags. This feature will ensure that we can create at most 1 physical network in the same traffic type with a null tag.\r\n>Every physical network should be associated with a tag so that when we create a new shared network, using the tags we can match the shared network with the physical network\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the old pr at: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3780\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-28T15:17:51Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T20:36:32Z","closed_at":"2023-01-05T20:36:32Z","merged_at":"2023-01-05T20:36:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"20306d612928712e5354bad57691b5fe4e1f59a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

We don't support dynamically removing or adding encryption to a VM.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested prior to this change - could move from non-encrypted to encrypted offerings.\r\n\r\nTested after this change - clean error indicating the encryption type must not change if selected offering does not match current offering encryption setting. Tested both compute-only disk offering and service offering referencing existing disk offerings.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n* Service offering with compute-only disk offerings\r\n* Service offering with compute referencing disk offerings\r\n* Trying to go from encrypted to non-encrypted\r\n* Trying to go from non-encrypted to encrypted\r\n* VM referencing deleted disk offering still correctly blocks move to offering with different encryption setting\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 2 19 45

Description\r\nWhen a volume is removed, ACS inserts a `VOLUME.DELETE` record into the `cloud.usage_event` table. If the volume is removed without the expunge option, it can still be restored. \r\nWhen the volume is restored, ACS does not insert a new record in the `cloud.usage_event` stating that it has been recreated. Thus, the volume continues to be used without being accounted for.\r\nThis PR adds an event in the volume restore process that indicates the volume was recreated. So it will be accounted for.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup,

and recreating volumes and checking the DB to see if the event was added.\r\nSome unit tests were also
