What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up pr of #22017 which added `map_zip_with` function.\r\nIn the test, when creating a lambda function, we use the `valueContainsNull` values for the nullabilities of the value arguments, but we should've used `true` as the same as `bind` method because the values might be `null` if the keys don't match.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded small tests and existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-16T19:27:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T05:24:57Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T05:24:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a16b2be54e4491b16ac0826785e278bbecc10be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45d044c42fd8b785c734a920f4b557ca469a5212","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-23938/fix_tests","ref":"issues/SPARK-23938/fix_tests","sha":"45d044c42fd8b785c734a920f4b557ca469a5212","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

this time the [`outputColumns`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9f558601e822b7596e4bcc141d5c91a5a8859628/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand.scala#L59) is `col1#5L`. So spark will use `col1` as the column name of the parquet.\r\n\r\nBefore [SPARK-22834](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22834). The [`allColumns`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ec122209fb35a65637df42eded64b0203e105aae/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileFormatWriter.scala#L122) is `queryExecution.analyzed.output`, it's not optimized.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have three ways to solve this issue:\r\n1. Read the column name in the view with the actual column name. but it is difficult to handle all cases. Please see the [third commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22124/commits/9b16ff0f0581366f587db735658e3110237ceef0).\r\n\r\n2. Do not remove redundant alias if plan is `Command`. Because alias may be useful.\r\n\r\n3. Change [this line](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b4bf8be549afa51e931e48dd79ddd9480f567b13/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/package.scala#L180) from `case a if resolver(a.name, name) => a.withName(name)` to `case a if resolver(a.name, name) => a`. But this change will cause some test failures:\r\n```scala\r\n[info] - order-by-nulls-ordering.sql *** FAILED *** (4 seconds, 789 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   Expected

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn MessageEncoder.java, the header would always be allocated on onheap memory regardless of whether netty was configured to use/prefer onheap or offheap. By default this made netty allocate 16mb of onheap memory for a tiny header message. It would be more practical to use preallocated buffers.\r\n\r\nUsing a memory monitor tool on a simple spark application, the following services currently allocate 16 mb of onheap memory:\r\nnetty-rpc-client\r\nnetty-blockTransfer-client\r\nnetty-external-shuffle-client\r\n\r\nWith this change, the memory monitor tool reports all three of these services as using 0 b of onheap memory. The offheap memory allocation does not increase, but more of the already-allocated space is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested change using spark-memory-tool

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21698\r\n\r\nWhen Spark rerun tasks for an RDD, there are 3 different behaviors:\r\n1. determinate. Always return the same result with same order when rerun.\r\n2. unordered. Returns same data set in random order when rerun.\r\n3. indeterminate. Returns different result when rerun.\r\n\r\nNormally Spark doesn't need to care about it. Spark runs stages one by one, when a task is failed, just rerun it. Although the rerun task may return a different result, users will not be surprised.\r\n\r\nHowever, Spark may rerun a finished stage when seeing fetch failures. When this happens, Spark needs to rerun all the tasks of all the succeeding stages if the RDD output is indeterminate, because the input of the succeeding stages has been changed.\r\n\r\nIf the RDD output is determinate, we only need to rerun the failed tasks of the succeeding stages, because the input doesn't change.\r\n\r\nIf the RDD output is unordered, it's same as determinate, because shuffle partitioner is always deterministic(round-robin partitioner is not a shuffle partitioner that extends `org.apache.spark.Partitioner`), so the reducers will still get the same input data set.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed the failure handling for `repartition`, to avoid correctness issues.\r\n\r\nFor `repartition`, it applies a stateful map function to generate a round-robin id, which is order sensitive and makes the RDD's output indeterminate. When the stage contains `repartition` reruns, we must also rerun all the tasks of all the succeeding stages.\r\n\r\n**future improvement:**\r\n1. Currently we can't rollback and rerun a shuffle map stage, and just fail. We should fix it later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25341\r\n2. Currently we can't rollback and rerun a result stage, and just fail. We should fix it later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25342\r\n3. We should provide public API to allow users to tag the random level of the RDD's computing function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How is this pull request tested?\r\na new test

Now the code is represented by a String. If the code references a variable, this means that we are loosing track of its usage.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly important as the `value` of an `ExprCode` is (correctly) a `ExprValue`. Thus, if we have current code referencing a variable in it, we are loosing track of the referenced variable.\r\n\r\nSo the PR proposes to represent the code in `SimpleExprValue` using a `Block`, in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKafkaContinuousSinkSuite leaks a Kafka cluster because both KafkaSourceTest and KafkaContinuousSinkSuite create a Kafka cluster but `afterAll` only shuts down one cluster. This leaks a Kafka cluster and causes that some Kafka thread crash and kill JVM when SBT is trying to clean up tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the leak and also adds a shut down hook to detect Kafka cluster leak.\r\n\r\nIn additions, it also fixes `AdminClient` leak and cleans up cached producers (When a record is writtn using a producer, the producer will keep refreshing the topic and I don't find an API to clear it except closing the producer) to eliminate the following annoying logs:\r\n```\r\n8/13 15:34:42.568 kafka-admin-client-thread | adminclient-4 WARN NetworkClient: [AdminClient clientId=adminclient-4] Connection to node 0 could not be established.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn #12127 , we moved the ExtractPythonUDFs rule to the physical phase, while there was another option: do ExtractPythonUDFs at the end of optimizer.\r\n\r\nCurrently we hit 2 issues when exacting python UDFs at physical phase:\r\n\r\n1. It happens after data source v2 strategy, so data source v2 strategy needs to deal with python udfs carefully and adds project to produce unsafe row for python udf. See #22206\r\n2. It happens after file source strategy, so we may keep Python UDF as data filter in FileSourceScanExec and fail the planner when try to extract it later. \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move ExtractPythonUDFs to the end of optimizer.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new regression test\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T14:29:12Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T09:14:14Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T03:01:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14f7d8fd8ed727539381d45549987618bcb179f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2325a4f18a2bc6cc95d96bc5ac6790749b3e927e","head":{"label":"icexelloss:SPARK-24721-udf-filter","ref":"SPARK-24721-udf-filter","sha":"2325a4f18a2bc6cc95d96bc5ac6790749b3e927e","user":{"login":"icexelloss","id":793516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss","html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87476665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzQ3NjY2NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"icexelloss/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icexelloss","id":793516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss","html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd logging for all generated methods from the `CodeGenerator` whose bytecode size goes above 8000 bytes.\r\nThis is to help with gathering stats on how often Spark is generating methods too big to be JIT'd. It covers all codegen scenarios, include whole-stage codegen and also individual expression codegen, e.g. unsafe projection, mutable projection, etc.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested that logging did happen when generated method was above 8000 bytes.\r\nAlso added a new unit test case to `CodeGenerationSuite` to verify that the logging did happen.","created_at":"2018-08-14T10:53:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T04:41:12Z","closed_at":"2018-08-14T23:43:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95ba9ec6d5ccbc41462ee08a7ddbdd3ee7175050","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/640c9cd3b99d51f38c9b1a0c3f94bae676d11e51","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:codegen-8k-logging","ref":"codegen-8k-logging","sha":"640c9cd3b99d51f38c9b1a0c3f94bae676d11e51","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

PR has been superceded by #22081\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncrement the kinesis client, producer and transient AWS SDK versions to a more recent release.\r\n\r\nThis is to help with the move off bouncy castle of #21146 and #22081; the goal is that moving up to the new SDK will allow a JVM with unlimited JCE but without bouncy castle to work with Kinesis endpoints. \r\n\r\nWhy this specific set of artifacts? it syncs up with the 1.11.271 AWS SDK used by hadoop 3.0.3, hadoop-3.1. and hadoop 3.1.1; that's been stable for the uses there (s3, STS, dynamo). \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRunning all the external/kinesis-asl tests via maven with java 8.121 & unlimited JCE, without bouncy castle (#21146); default endpoint of us-west.2. Without this SDK update I was getting http cert validation errors, with it they went away.\r\n\r\n# This PR is not ready without \r\n\r\n* Jenkins test runs to see what it is happy with\r\n* more testing: repeated runs, another endpoint\r\n* looking at the new deprecation warnings and selectively addressing them (the AWS SDKs are pretty aggressive about deprecation, but sometimes they increase the complexity of the client code or block some codepaths off completely)\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T06:03:23Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T22:04:01Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T17:10:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f5890b08cef24d998db262ba5c27aff9e731185","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e79e5b9c0bbdf24dcc3cda30dc2c1a70d12b02aa","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cloud/SPARK-25111-kinesis","ref":"cloud/SPARK-25111-kinesis","sha":"e79e5b9c0bbdf24dcc3cda30dc2c1a70d12b02aa","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBack port of #20393.\r\n\r\nCurrently shuffle repartition uses RoundRobinPartitioning, the generated result is nondeterministic since the sequence of input rows are not determined.\r\n\r\nThe bug can be triggered when there is a repartition call following a shuffle (which would lead to non-deterministic row ordering), as the pattern shows below:\r\nupstream stage -> repartition stage -> result stage\r\n(-> indicate a shuffle)\r\nWhen one of the executors process goes down, some tasks on the repartition stage will be retried and generate inconsistent ordering, and some tasks of the result stage will be retried generating different data.\r\n\r\nThe following code returns 931532, instead of 1000000:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 1000 * 1000, 1).repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  x\r\n}.repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId < 2) {\r\n    throw new Exception(\"pkill -f java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nres.distinct().count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we propose a most straight-forward way to fix this problem by performing a local sort before partitioning, after we make the input row ordering deterministic, the function from rows to partitions is fully deterministic too.\r\n\r\nThe downside of the approach is that with extra local sort inserted, the performance of repartition() will go down, so we add a new config named `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition` to control whether this patch is applied. The patch is default enabled to be safe-by-default, but user may choose to manually turn it off to avoid performance regression.\r\n\r\nThis patch also changes the output rows ordering of repartition(), that leads to a bunch of test cases failure because they are comparing the results directly.\r\n\r\nAdd unit test in ExchangeSuite.\r\n\r\nWith this patch(and `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition` set to true), the following query returns 1000000:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition\", \"true\")\r\n\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 1000 * 1000, 1).repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  x\r\n}.repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId < 2) {\r\n    throw new Exception(\"pkill -f java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nres.distinct().count()\r\n\r\nres7: Long = 1000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthor: Xingbo Jiang <xingbo.jiang@databricks.com>\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan all SBT unit tests for org.apache.spark.sql.*.\r\n\r\nRan pyspark tests for module pyspark-sql.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-11T16:19:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T17:31:14Z","closed_at":"2018-08-24T05:19:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"208daf2289cad1419fe12fe74518915d939f7edd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2edad85c39f0fbfea8c8361e9ee420abc6fe4202","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-23207","ref":"SPARK-23207","sha":"2edad85c39f0fbfea8c8361e9ee420abc6fe4202","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(a) disabled rest submission server by default in standalone mode\r\n(b) fails the standalone master if rest server enabled & authentication secret set\r\n(c) fails the mesos cluster dispatcher if authentication secret set\r\n(d) doc updates\r\n(e) when submitting a standalone app, only try the rest submission first if spark.master.rest.enabled=true\r\n\r\notherwise you'd see a 10 second pause like\r\n18/08/09 08:13:22 INFO RestSubmissionClient: Submitting a request to launch an application in

though I had to do that on slightly different code as I don't have mesos native libs around.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran the tests in the mesos module & in core for org.apache.spark.deploy.*\r\n\r\nI ran a test on a cluster with standalone master to make sure I could still start with the right configs, and would fail the right way

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue is pretty similar to [SPARK-21907](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21907). \r\n\r\n\"allocateArray\" in [ShuffleInMemorySorter.reset](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9b8521e53e56a53b44c02366a99f8a8ee1307bbf/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/shuffle/sort/ShuffleInMemorySorter.java#L99) may trigger a spill and cause ShuffleInMemorySorter access the released `array`. Another task may get the same memory page from the pool. This will cause two tasks access the same memory page. When a task reads memory written by another task, many types of failures may happen. Here are some examples I  have seen:\r\n\r\n- JVM crash. (This is easy to reproduce in a unit test as we fill newly allocated and deallocated memory with 0xa5 and 0x5a bytes which usually points to an invalid memory address)\r\n- java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method violates its general contract!\r\n- java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.spark.memory.TaskMemoryManager.getPage(TaskMemoryManager.java:384)\r\n- java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot grow BufferHolder by size -536870912 because the size after growing exceeds size limitation 2147483632\r\n\r\nThis PR resets states in `ShuffleInMemorySorter.reset` before calling `allocateArray` to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit test will make JVM crash without the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-10T00:12:11Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T11:26:36Z","closed_at":"2018-08-10T17:57:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4e6970c01202dd78412b0cb472734a00fcfbdd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54799cae8ef0727988bbb863d326ea61b4d9ae72","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-25081","ref":"SPARK-25081","sha":"54799cae8ef0727988bbb863d326ea61b4d9ae72","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRules like `HandleNullInputsForUDF` (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24891) do not stabilize (can apply new changes to a plan indefinitely) and can cause problems like SQL cache mismatching.\r\nIdeally, all rules whether in a once-policy batch or a fixed-point-policy batch should stabilize after the number of runs specified. Once-policy should be considered a performance improvement, a assumption that the rule can stabilize after just one run rather than an assumption that the rule won't be applied more than once. Those once-policy rules should be able to run fine with fixed-point policy rule as well.\r\nCurrently we already have a check for fixed-point and throws an exception if maximum number of runs is reached and the plan is still changing. Here, in this PR, a similar check is added for once-policy and throws an exception if the plan changes between the first run and the second run of a once-policy rule.\r\n\r\nFrom this test result, we can find out which of the analysis rules break this check so we can fix them later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-09T17:29:22Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T03:41:35Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T03:41:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52449481844742d0a9be34d48b22257e77899865","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22060/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22060/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22060/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7fc1d11388babe169cf45ce2376d898d89f299b7","head":{"label":"maryannxue:once_policy","ref":"once_policy","sha":"7fc1d11388babe169cf45ce2376d898d89f299b7","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe class of UnsafeExternalSorter used UnsafeAlignedOffset to make the entire record of 8 byte Items aligned, but ShuffleExternalSorter not.\r\nThe SPARC platform requires this because using a 4 byte Int for record lengths causes the entire record of 8 byte Items to become misaligned by 4 bytes. Using a 8 byte long for record length keeps things 8 byte aligned.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting Test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-09T09:15:15Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T01:13:43Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T01:13:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"245562d8b32839c1169c83067f97b96f9e228559","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d95d35794528702a2de5523ca00334d479598c57","head":{"label":"eatoncys:UnsafeAlignedOffset","ref":"UnsafeAlignedOffset","sha":"d95d35794528702a2de5523ca00334d479598c57","user":{"login":"eatoncys","id":26834091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODM0MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26834091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys","html_url":"https://github.com/eatoncys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86900066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjkwMDA2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"eatoncys/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eatoncys","id":26834091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODM0MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26834091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys","html_url":"https://github.com/eatoncys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eatoncys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eatoncys/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #21305 that adds a test suite for AppendData analysis.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the following problems uncovered by these tests:\r\n* Incorrect order of data types passed to `canWrite` is fixed\r\n* The field check calls `canWrite` first to ensure all errors are found\r\n* `AppendData#resolved` must check resolution of the query's attributes\r\n* Column names are quoted to show empty names\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test suite for AppendData

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs the user uses Kafka transactions to write data, the offsets in Kafka will be non-consecutive. It will contains some transaction (commit or abort) markers. In addition, if the consumer's `isolation.level` is `read_committed`, `poll` will not return aborted messages either. Hence, we will see non-consecutive offsets in the date returned by `poll`. However, as `seekToEnd` may move the offset point to these missing offsets, there are 4 possible corner cases we need to support:\r\n\r\n- The whole batch contains no data messages\r\n- The first offset in a batch is not a committed data message\r\n- The last offset in a batch is not a committed data message\r\n- There is a gap in the middle of a batch\r\n\r\nThey are all covered by the new unit tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-08T17:51:58Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T17:14:38Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T15:49:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58963473d098f7c67c5bf9e78ab994be4b5ea920","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea804cfe840196519cc9444be9bedf03d10aa11a","head":{"label":"zsxwing:kafka-transaction-read","ref":"kafka-transaction-read","sha":"ea804cfe840196519cc9444be9bedf03d10aa11a","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark's IN operator behaves different from other RDBMS (Oracle, Postgres) when structs containing NULL fields are involved. In this case, Spark returns `false`, while other RDBMS return `NULL`. This is critical especially when there are NOT IN filters, as Spark doesn't filter rows containing NULLs in that scenario (instead other RDBMS do).\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to change Spark's IN operator behavior in order to align with the behavior of other RDBMS and introduces a flag which can be used by users to switch back to the previous behavior.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the proposed change affects only the IN operator when the values are structs (ie. every value is a list of more than one element) and NULL are involved. The proposed behavior can be summarized as follows:\r\n - If the value before IN contains a NULL element, IN evaluates to `null`;\r\n - If the list of values contains a values with a NULL element, then: If the list contains also the value looked for, `true` is returned; otherwise, `null` is returned\r\n\r\nPlease notice that Hive and Presto, instead, behave as Spark **before this change** for this specific scenario. But they don't support IN with subqueries returning more than one value. So **before this change** Spark is anyway the only system where the IN operator behaves incoherently between IN + subquery and IN + literals.\r\n\r\nSummarizing:\r\n\r\n - Spark is the only framework which behaves differently with the same data when IN contains literals and subquery;\r\n - Hive and Presto behave as Spark before the PR when literals are involved (but Presto throws exception when
