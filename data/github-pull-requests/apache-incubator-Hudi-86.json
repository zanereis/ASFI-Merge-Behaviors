*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWith migration of Hudi to spark 2.4.4 and to using native spark-avro, there is an issue with conversion of array of struct fields because of the way spark-avro handles avro schema conversion vs databricks-avro. This issue is similar to #1223.\r\n \r\nCurrent struct namespace uses the [way](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/AvroConversionHelper.scala#L346) how databricks/spark-avro does, the namespace for elements of an array will contain the array name. But for spark/spark-avro, each field in a struct has the same child [namespace](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.4/external/avro/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/avro/SchemaConverters.scala#L176). So the namespace for elements of an array won't contain the name of array but will contain the struct name.\r\n\r\nFor example, the expected avro schema is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"AWS_TEST_record\",\r\n  \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.AWS_TEST\",\r\n  \"fields\" : [ {\r\n    \"name\" : \"offset\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"long\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"partition\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"long\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"value\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ {\r\n      \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"value\",\r\n      \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.AWS_TEST.AWS_TEST_record\",\r\n      \"fields\" : [ {\r\n        \"name\" : \"prop1\",\r\n        \"type\" : [ \"string\", \"null\" ]\r\n      }, {\r\n        \"name\" : \"prop2\",\r\n        \"type\" : [ {\r\n          \"type\" : \"array\",\r\n          \"items\" : [ {\r\n            \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n            \"name\" : \"prop2\",\r\n            \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.AWS_TEST.AWS_TEST_record.value\",\r\n            \"fields\" : [ {\r\n              \"name\" : \"withinProp1\",\r\n              \"type\" : [ \"string\", \"null\" ]\r\n            }, {\r\n              \"name\" : \"withinProp2\",\r\n              \"type\" : [ \"long\", \"null\" ]\r\n            } ]\r\n          }, \"null\" ]\r\n        }, \"null\" ]\r\n      } ]\r\n    }, \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"op_ts\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"string\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"year_partition\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"int\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"id\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"string\", \"null\" ]\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe element of array has this namespace ```hoodie.AWS_TEST.AWS_TEST_record.value```, but in current Hudi code, Hudi would create a element with this namespace ```hoodie.AWS_TEST.AWS_TEST_record.prop2``` which would cause the ```not in union``` error.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix conversion of Spark array of struct type to Avro schema\r\n- Modify the schema of data used in unit tests to have array of struct type data as well, so that any issue with array of struct type can be caught earlier\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nexample timeline:\r\n\r\nt0 -> create bucket1.parquet\r\nt1 -> create and append updates bucket1.log\r\nt2 -> request compaction\r\nt3 -> create bucket2.parquet\r\n\r\nif compaction at t2 takes a long time, incremental reads using HoodieParquetInputFormat may make progress to read commits at t3 and skip data ingested at t1 leading to 'data loss' .(Data will still be on disk, but incremental readers wont see it because its in log file and readers move to t3)\r\n\r\nTo workaround this problem, we want to stop returning data belonging to commits > compaction_requested/inprogress_instant. After compaction is complete, incremental reader would see updates in t2, t3, so on. Disadvantage is that long running compactions can make it look like reader is 'stuck'. But that is better than skipping updates.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Change HoodieParquetInputFormat to read commits prior to compaction instant\r\n- Added unit tests to validate behavior\r\n- Fix broken test utils for reading records\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\nmvn test (TestMergeOnReadTable and TestHoodieActiveTimeline)\r\n\r\nSome discussion is on https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1389, sorry I messed up rebase, so resending as a new PR to avoid confusion\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2020-03-11T03:08:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T17:45:42Z","closed_at":"2020-04-10T17:45:42Z","merged_at":"2020-04-10T17:45:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0f96e072650d39433929c6efe3bc0b2cd882a39","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1396/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1396/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1396/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/692604937ad658192c2518e0be1e6a1cd4bae993","head":{"label":"satishkotha:sk/compactionMor","ref":"sk/compactionMor","sha":"692604937ad658192c2518e0be1e6a1cd4bae993","user":{"login":"satishkotha","id":2992755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTI3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2992755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha","html_url":"https://github.com/satishkotha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235672681,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2NzI2ODE=","name":"incubator-hudi","full_name":"satishkotha/incubator-hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"satishkotha","id":2992755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTI3NTU=","

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nI broke CLI when i added compactions show archived command.\r\n I still dont understand spring shell well enough to explain why the existing commands wont work. But the alternative commands I picked seemed to work. Please let me know if any of you have seen similar issues with spring shell and how command parsing works.\r\n\r\nCLI 'commits show archived' fails with\r\n\r\n->commits show archived\r\nOption '' is not available for this command. Use tab assist or the \"help\" command to see the legal options\r\nThis seems to be because 'compactions show archived'. If i remove @CliCommand annotation from compactions, commits show archived works.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Chose different command names to make all commands 'work'\r\n- change method names to not overlap with each other\r\n- we may have to patch this to 0.5.2 branch as well \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nManually verified the change by running CLI\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nexample timeline:\r\n\r\nt0 -> create bucket1.parquet\r\nt1 -> create and append updates bucket1.log\r\nt2 -> request compaction\r\nt3 -> create bucket2.parquet\r\n\r\nif compaction at t2 takes a long time, incremental reads using HoodieParquetInputFormat may make progress to read commits at t3 and skip data ingested at t1 leading to 'data loss' .(Data will still be on disk, but incremental readers wont see it because its in log file and readers move to t3)\r\n\r\nTo workaround this problem, we want to stop returning data belonging to commits > compaction_requested/inprogress_instant. After compaction is complete, incremental reader would see updates in t2, t3, so on. Disadvantage is that long running compactions can make it look like reader is 'stuck'. But that is better than data loss.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Change HoodieParquetInputFormat to read commits prior to compaction instant\r\n- Added unit tests to validate behavior \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\nmvn test (TestMergeOnReadTable and TestHoodieActiveTimeline)\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHoodieTable handleUpdate takes in fileId and list of records. It does not validate all records belong to same partitionPath. This is error prone - there is already at least one test that is passing in records that belong to several partitions to this method. Fix to add partitionPath and also validate all records belong to same partition path. \r\n I'm not entirely sure this change is needed though. I think its cleaner to include partition path everywhere. It is a good safeguard, but maybe its unlikely this can happen in production. Sending it out since i already spent some time. I can discard if others think this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Do not assume first record partition can be used for all remaining records\r\n- Track partition path in Bucket and in Partitioner\r\n- Fail updates if they somehow end up in wrong partition\r\n- Fix broken test to validate requests fail\r\n- There is one other test commented out (looks like by mistake). Bring it back\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nTestCopyOnWriteTable (especially fixed broken testInsertUpsertWithHoodieAvroPayload)\r\nTestMergeOnReadTable\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR is to resolve the following problem:\r\n\r\nThe user is using a homebrew Spark data source to read new data and write to Hudi table\r\n\r\nThe user would like to migrate to Delta Streamer\r\n\r\nBut the Delta Streamer only checks the last commit metadata, if there is no checkpoint info, then the Delta Streamer will use the default. For Kafka source, it is LATEST. \r\n\r\nThe user would like to run the homebrew Spark data source reader and Delta Streamer in parallel to prevent data loss, but the Spark data source writer will make commit without checkpoint info, which will reset the delta streamer. \r\n\r\nSo if we have an option to allow the user to retrieve the checkpoint from previous commits instead of the latest commit would be helpful for the migration. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add an option to restrieve checkpoint in DeltaSync*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWith large clean files, archival process results in OOM. See HUDI-633. Limit archive file block size by number of bytes\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add option to limit  archival batch size by number of bytes in block in addition to maximum number of records allowed in a batch\r\n- This does not prevent OOM if a single record is larger than jvm heap size.  \r\n- Note that in worst case, a single instant details can take up entire block. This likely has higher metadata overhead. But I think marginal increase in storage is acceptable for metadata. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Run TestHoodieCommitArchiveLog#testArchiveTableWithLargeCleanFiles\r\n- Verified large clean file that caused OOM can be archived with specified config.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

Solution\r\n\r\nUse `kryo.setInstantiatorStrategy(new Kryo.DefaultInstantiatorStrategy(new StdInstantiatorStrategy()));`\r\n\r\nThe overried method \"SerializationUtils.KryoInstantiator.KryoBase#newInstantiator\" will called when each entry deserialized, but the only \"Kryo#newInstantiator\" be called when then type doesn’t has a no-arg constructor.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20113411/75185416-0553d800-5781-11ea-9f8a-4f397037be4c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20113411/75185484-274d5a80-5781-11ea-8161-0aab095a8f14.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##

- This is very rough cut of few things I tried; Just for sharing purposes\r\n - Kryo needs serializers and once we add them, the ser/deser is fast and writing finishes 10-20x faster\r\n - DiskbasedMap is tracking too many things redundantly and incurring its cost as well.\r\n - TODO : Need to break the kryo and map fix in differnt PRs\r\n - TODO : For map entry thinning, need to handle compaction, fix code structure, tests\r\n - TODO : For kyro, one more pass with good understanding of APIs, tests, null handling, cleanup\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- This PR aggregates code coverage across modules to get a holistic coverage number (since we have tests that gets run across modules. e.g. hudi-client tests classes in hudi-common)\r\n- This also published the report to codecov.io (e.g. [report from the fork](https://codecov.io/gh/ramachandranms/incubator-hudi))\r\n- Above step automatically adds coverage report to every PR (e.g. [PR from fork](https://github.com/ramachandranms/incubator-hudi/pull/2))\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Modified pom files to include coverage in missing modules (hudi-hadoop-mr, hudi-spark & hudi-timeline-service)\r\n- Added a wrapper module for aggregation (due to limitations in jacoco). This can be remove in future once [this PR](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/pull/1007) gets merged to a release.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Ran travis in private fork and verified the published report & PR.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nBefore we embark on moving spark specific code to `hudi-spark` and making a `hudi-writer-common`, lets fix some current inconsistencies in the class organization.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Just package, class moves and renames with the following intent\r\n - `client` now has all the various client classes, that do the transaction management\r\n - `func` renamed to `execution` and some helpers moved to `client/utils`\r\n - All compaction code under `io` now under `table/compact`\r\n - Rollback code under `table/rollback` and in general all code for individual operations under `table`\r\n - `exception` `config`, `metrics` left untouched\r\n - Moved the tests also accordingly\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2020-02-21T09:51:41Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T16:05:59Z","closed_at":"2020-02-27T16:05:59Z","merged_at":"2020-02-27T16:05:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"71170fafe77e11ea1a458a38e3395a471d94a047","assignee":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/5b20891619380a66e2a62c9e57fb28c4f5ed948b","head":{"label":"vinothchandar:hudi-554-write-client-cleanup","ref":"hudi-554-write-client-cleanup","sha":"5b20891619380a66e2a62c9e57fb28c4f5ed948b","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76998587,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Njk5ODU4Nw==","name":"hudi","full_name":"vinothchandar/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar/hudi","description":"Spark

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nCLI shell is very restrictive and it is sometimes hard to filter specific rows. Adding ability to export results of CLI command into temporary table. So CLI users can write HiveQL queries to look for any specific information. \r\n(This idea has been brought up by multiple folks on the team, thanks everyone for great suggestions)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Add 'exportToTableName' cli option for commits command.\r\n- This creates a temp table in spark session. Users can write HiveQL queries against the table to filter desired row.\r\n- Note, intentionally not using Hoodie format for temp tables (to avoid versioning and any potential bugs in hoodie)\r\n- Only added this option for commits. But can add it to other commands if general approach looks good.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n->commits show archived --startTs \"20200121224545\" --endTs \"20200224004414\"   --includeExtraMetadata true

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nData types extending CharSequence implement a #toString method which\r\nprovides an easy way to convert them to String. For example,\r\norg.apache.avro.util.Utf8 is easily convertible into String if we use\r\nthe toString() method. It's better to make the support more generic to\r\nsupport a wider range of data types as partitionKey.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Modified TimestampBasedKeyGenerator to support data types

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- This PR is to address the JIRA ticket - [HUDI-409](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-409)\r\n- Current logic to determine corrupted block (by just using \\#HUDI\\# marker alone) fails to address following issues\r\n  1. Crashing the reader if the next block of the corrupted block has the exact same size as amount of missing data from the corrupted block\r\n  2. Start of the next block is determined solely based on the marker and this can create multiple corrupted block if the partial data of corrupted block has the marker as part of the written data\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Made changes to HoodieLogFileReader's `next()` and `prev()` methods. Added additional check to validate if block sizes stored at start and end of the blocks are the same. Report block as corrupted if they don't match\r\n- Modified existing unit tests `TestHoodieLogFormat#testAppendAndReadOnCorruptedLog()` & `TestHoodieLogFormat#testAppendAndReadOnCorruptedLogInReverse()` to add additional blocks to validate the reader changes\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Modified  `TestHoodieLogFormat#testAppendAndReadOnCorruptedLog()` & `TestHoodieLogFormat#testAppendAndReadOnCorruptedLogInReverse()` tests to account for the change\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2020-02-13T23:13:31Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T22:02:05Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T21:26:55Z","merged_at":"2020-03-03T21:26:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d46ce380a3929605b3838238e8aa07a9918ab7a","assignee":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/be2344e5613749740b28cf6cb7f6b69396677be1","head":{"label":"ramachandranms:HUDI-409","ref":"HUDI-409","sha":"be2344e5613749740b28cf6cb7f6b69396677be1","user":{"login":"ramachandranms","id":2144396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDQzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2144396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms","html_url":"https://github.com/ramachandranms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239829516,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4Mjk1MTY=","name":"incubator-hudi","full_name":"ramachandranms/incubator-hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ramachandranms","id":2144396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDQzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2144396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms","html_url":"https://github.com/ramachandranms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramachandranms/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ramachandranms/incubator-hudi","description":"Upserts

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe issue is well described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-607 . It fixes an issue where Hive sync fails to create table, when a Date type column is the partition column for the table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Make changes in DataSourceUtils, to check if the field for which value is being returned is of Avro Logical Date Type. If yes, it is returned as the actual date string and not epoch day value. This would let Hudi use the actual date string as the value, everywhere in its metadata.\r\n- Unit tests\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added **DataSourceUtilsTest** class\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n- Removing 2GB spark partition limitations in HoodieBloomIndex with spark 2.4.4\r\n- Prior to spark 2.4.0, each spark partition has a limit of 2GB. In Hudi 0.5.1, after we upgraded to spark 2.4.4, we don't have the limitation anymore. Hence removing the safe parallelism constraint we had in HoodieBloomIndex. \r\nMore info can be found here : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24296\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Removing 2GB spark partition limitations in HoodieBloomIndex with spark 2.4.4*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.
