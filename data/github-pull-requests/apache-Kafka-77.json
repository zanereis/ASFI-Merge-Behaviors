(detailed below)\r\n5. add a new constructor for `MaterializedInternal`, to accept `StreamsConfig`, so that we can store the storeImplementation provided, to create storeBuilder for the graph node\r\n6. When creating store builder for a node, before, we check if the `storeSuppier` in materialized is null or not, if null, we use `RockDB store supplier`. Now, we'll get the default store supplier via store implementation\r\n7. Add a `KeyValueStoreBuilder` constructor to accept a `StoreImplementation`, so that the processor API users can also benefit from it.\r\n\r\nFor (4), in KIP-591, we wanted to get the `Stream props` during `StreamBuilder.build(props)`, but I found it's too late to get the props. During `StreamBuilder#build`, we already built all the Stream graph nodes, including `StoreBuilder` in each node. So, I think we should get the props when creating `StreamBuilder`, so that when each node creation, we can initialize the store supplier via store implementation via config. This way, we can also adopt more optimization and customization in the future during building the stream graph nodes in `StreamBuilder`.\r\n\r\nThe problem I can think of, is that if the props passed to `StreamBuilder` constructor is different from the one passed into `build(props)`. We can actually just output a warning message and honor the one passed in that method, and `deprecate` the `build(props)` method in this KIP.\r\n\r\nSee if you have any thoughts about it. Thanks.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

noticed that a system test using a KRaft cluster with 3 brokers but only 1 co-located controller did not force-kill the second and third broker after shutting down the first broker (the one with the controller).  The issue was a floating point rounding error.  This patch adjusts for the rounding error and also makes the logic work for an even number of controllers.  A local run of `tests/kafkatest/sanity_checks/test_bounce.py` succeeded (and I manually increased the cluster size for the 1 co-located controller case and observed the correct kill behavior: the second and third brokers were force-killed as expected).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

this while reading the code. We did a \"a little heavy\" check each time after performing assignment, which is to compare the \"assigned topics\" set and the \"subscribed topics\" set, to see if there's any topics not existed in another set. Also, the \"assigned topics\" set is created by traversing all the assigned partitions, which will be a little heavy if partition numbers are large. \r\n\r\nHowever, as the comments described, it's a safe-guard for user-customized assignor, which might do assignment that we don't expected. In most cases, user will just use the in-product assignor, which guarantee that we only assign the topics from subscribed topics. Therefore, no need this check for in-product assignors.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added an \"in-product assignor names\" list, and we'll in `consumerCoordinator` check if the assignor is one of in-product assignors, to decide if we need to do the additional check. Also add test for it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

porting** - https://github.com/linkedin/kafka/pull/186\r\n\r\n**TICKET** = [KAFKA-13188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13188)\r\n**LI_DESCRIPTION** =\r\nThe current KafkaConsumer code includes support for allocating buffers from MemoryPool when allocating bytes for requests to Brokers. However, the code doesn't release them back to the pool and hence, rendering pooling moot. Currently, it works because it uses MemoryPool.NONE which just mallocs buffer every time a buffer is requested. However, this won't work if a different memory pool implementation is used.\r\n\r\nThe consumer can't just release the pool back into the memory because the fetch requests keep on holding on to the references to the pool in CompletedFetch objects which live across multiple poll calls. The idea here is to use ref counting based approach, where the ClientResponse increments ref count every time a CompletedFetch object is created and decrement when the fetch is drained after a poll calls returning records.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the things such as metadata, offset commit, list offsets it is somewhat easier as the client is done with the response bytes after response future callback is completed.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the ClientResponseWithFinalize class for debugging purposes as well protected by linkedin.enable.client.resonse.leakcheck flag. The class uses finalizer to check whether there is some issue in code due to which the buffer wasn't released back to the pool yet. However, during in an actual production setting, the finalizers are costly and hence, not enabled by default.\r\n\r\n**EXIT_CRITERIA** = If and when the upstream ticket is merged, and the changes are pulled in\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

type.\r\n- `ElectLeadersRequest.getErrorResponse` may raise NPE when `TopicPartitions` is null.\r\n- Controller should not do preferred election if `ElectLeaders` specifies `UNCLEAN` election.\r\n- Controller should not do unclean election if `ElectLeaders` specifies `PREFERRED` election.\r\n- Controller should use proper error codes to handle cases when desired leader is unavailable or when no election is needed because a desired leader is already elected.\r\n- When election for all partitions is requested (indicated with null `TopicPartitions` field), the response should not return partitions for which no election was necessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition to extending the unit test coverage in `ReplicationControlManagerTest`, I have also converted `LeaderElectionCommandTest` to use

in `OrderedBytes#upperRange` method, we'll check key bytes 1 by 1, to see if there's a byte value >= first timestamp byte value, so that we can skip the following key bytes, because we know `compareTo` will always return 0 or 1. \r\n\r\nTake this test for example (in `WindowKeySchemaTest`)\r\n```java\r\npublic void testUpperBoundWithKeyBytesLargerAndSmallerThanFirstTimestampByte() {\r\n        // here, because the 3rd byte of the key (0x9) < the first timestamp byte (0xA), we'll skip this type, and appending the timestamp directly\r\n        final Bytes upper = windowKeySchema.upperRange(Bytes.wrap(new byte[] {0xC, 0xC, 0x9}), 0x0AffffffffffffffL);\r\n\r\n        // so the tested shorter key should be included in the upper range\r\n        assertThat(\r\n            \"shorter key with timestamp should be in range\",\r\n            upper.compareTo(\r\n                WindowKeySchema.toStoreKeyBinary(\r\n                    new byte[] {0xC, 0xC},\r\n                    0x0AffffffffffffffL,\r\n                    Integer.MAX_VALUE\r\n                )\r\n            ) >= 0\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        assertThat(upper, equalTo(WindowKeySchema.toStoreKeyBinary(new byte[] {0xC, 0xC}, 0x0AffffffffffffffL, Integer.MAX_VALUE)));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since we don't know how many bytes are skipped, we did a byteBuffer copy to another byte array in the end.\r\n\r\nHowever, in not all query cases, the first timestamp byte is alwyas **0**, because when we use the current timestamp (i.e. `System.currentTimeMillis()`), the first timestamp byte is `0`.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes the not all query cases  by not checking the key byte 1 by 1 (because we know the unsigned integer will always be >= 0), instead, put all bytes and timestamp directly. So, we won't have byte array copy in the end either.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

of [KAFKA-13132](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13132) has been resolved, but there is one part of one case not covered.\r\nFrom the ticket:\r\n`2. We only assign the topic ID when we are associating the log with the partition in replicamanager for the first time`\r\n\r\nWe covered the case where the log is already existing when the leader epoch is _equal_ (ie, no updates besides the topic ID), but we don't cover the update case where the leader epoch is bumped and we already have the log associated to the partition. \r\n\r\nThis PR ensures we correctly assign topic ID in the makeLeaders/Followers path when the log already exists.\r\nI've also added a test for the bumped leader epoch scenario.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

we used the metadata cache to determine whether or not to use topic IDs. Unfortunately, metadata cache updates with ZK controllers are in a separate request and may be too slow for the fetcher thread. This results in switching between topic names and topic IDs for topics that could just use IDs. \r\n\r\nThis change adds topic IDs to FetcherState created in LeaderAndIsr requests. It also supports updating this state for follower threads as soon as a LeaderAndIsr request provides a topic ID. \r\n\r\nI've opted to only update replica fetcher threads. Alter Log Dir threads will use either topic name or topic ID depending on what was present when they were created. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

This test is taking two iterations since the firs iteration is designed to fail due to unknow topic leader. However both the timeout and the backoff are set to 50ms, while the actual SYSTEM time is used. This means we are likely to timeout before executing the second iteration. I thought about using a mock time but dropped that idea as it may forgo the purpose of this test, instead I set the backoff time to 10ms so that we are almost unlikely to hit this error anymore.\r\n\r\n2. Found a minor issue while fixing this which is that when we have non-empty not-ready topics, but the topics-to-create is empty (which is possible as the test shouldCreateTopicWhenTopicLeaderNotAvailableAndThenTopicNotFound itself illustrates), we still call an empty create-topic function. Though it does not incur any round-trip it would still waste some cycles, so I branched it off and hence also simplified some unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit
