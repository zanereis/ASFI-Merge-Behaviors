If there are no matching DAGs, it resets the tags and displays a message saying \"No matching DAG tags found\" (which is the default behaviour). Developed in collaboration with @lotrias17.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-11 130229](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/120483063/7a8cbf5e-9903-4291-a7cb-b3221e3b9d5f)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-11 130239](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/120483063/7ade2ffa-3ae1-4626-a0db-7c831fdf5e7c)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-11 130248](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/120483063/85eef9a2-3b80-47ab-b0ff-ce3ebb9ec685)\r\n\r\nWe also implemented a test in [test_views_home.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...TiDeane:airflow:feature-38147-PR?expand=1#diff-81ef48c7266f1690897901984c78693b82eaef73c99d54c738782fc9541202ce).\r\n\r\nThe checkbox's state is saved in `localStorage`. When filtering the DAGs by tag in [views.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/views.py#L801), it now checks if the checkbox is marked, and if so it filters by AND instead of by OR.\r\n\r\ncloses: #38147\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

after a few recent changes in provider templates.\r\n\r\nThe template changes from #39552 have not been applied to the new apache.iceberg provider. Also we are preparing to re-release providers with 2.7.0 compatibility and there was a change in naming of packages updated in the provider doucmentation naming convention that has not been reflected in generated index and fixed in #39341 - but it has not been applied to all the providers.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a result of `breeze release-management\r\nprepare-provider-documentation --reapply-templates-only` that is supposed to consistently apply template changes to all providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the dag records count gets huge, and users try to delete\r\nDAG and DAG runs that are no longer needed or are stale, it \r\nis observed that the deletion is significantly slow. The reason\r\nfor this is that the CASCADING DELETES are slow. Although,\r\nwe have foreign key constraints in the referencing tables, they\r\ndo not create an index implicitly on those columns (dag_id in \r\nthe referencing tables in this case). Hence, we're creating indexes\r\non the 6 referencing table for CASCADE DELETES to speed up\r\nthe deletion of records. Without these indexes, it was observed\r\nthat it takes many hours to delete those records and it reduced \r\nto a few seconds after adding those indexes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

take [the discussion about adding Telemetry](https://lists.apache.org/thread/7f6qyr8w2n8w34g63s7ybhzphgt8h43m) forward, I am creating a draft PR that adds some basic telemetry to send to Scarf. \r\n\r\nVoting thread: https://lists.apache.org/thread/h1x2glvnd42rbj2q2rgpfo3pjhmpt307\r\n\r\nI have added docs on the data collection as well as a way to opt-out of it. \r\n\r\nTelemetry added at:\r\n- Scheduler startup [Custom telemetry](https://docs.scarf.sh/custom-telemetry/) similar to other popular projects like [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/commit/f0a63e27122972901f72c42b4b5b9eb9bed1ada3)\r\n- Webserver via a [tracking pixel](https://docs.scarf.sh/web-traffic/#creating-a-pixel), similar to [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26011/files)\r\n\r\nData collected:\r\n- Airflow version\r\n- Python version\r\n- Platform System info: Linux/Darwin\r\n- Machine type: arm64/aarch64\r\n- Airflow Metadata DB: Postgres/MySQL\r\n- DB: sqlite/postgres\r\n- DB version: 12.6.3\r\n- Number of DAGs\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1256\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/8811558/c347fe96-2c39-4696-a4dc-341302b0b0c1\">\r\n<img width=\"1305\" alt=\"image\"

with. For now, I am using the trial version.\r\n\r\nWe should also add it to the Airflow website similar to https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25639.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

I am currently working on debugging the following exception in my code which happens when the `self.rendered_map_index = jinja_env.from_string(template).render(context)` statement is executed (when render_map_index method from taskinstance.py is called).\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/158095947/1e6a14d7-b05e-415c-9949-04b568e83a35)\r\n\r\nAs of now, my code is aimed at rendering the map_index_template when an individual mapped task instance is marked \"succes\" in the UI. Once I am able to get this working, I will change it so that it also can render the map_index_template of all mapped task instances when the entire task instance is marked as success. To replicate the exception I am seeing, do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a DAG with a mapped task (I used the example in the issue)\r\n2. Trigger it in the UI\r\n3. Navigate to the task instance square in grid view\r\n4. Navigate to the Mapped Tasks[] tab\r\n5. Click on one of the mapped task instances that is not already running\r\n6. Use the blue \"Mark state as...\" button on the top right to mark the mapped task instance state as \"success\"\r\n\r\nPlease note that this exception only happens when the state is manually set, not when the task executes automatically. Hence, the changes don't affect current functionality.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

of these calls are super fast and neither has any kind of waiter or means of checking the status, so here can not be any sensor or trigger for them.  They are simple client calls, but I think making these Operators allowed us to simplify the complicated formatting on the client API call itself, for a better UX.\r\n\r\nOne question I have is the parameter name for `input` and `query`.  I feel like these should be standardized, but also we usually go out of our way to stick as close as possible to the API call's parameter names.  Let me know what you think.  For InvokeModel I used \"input_data\", I could standardize all three on that name or just leave them as I have here.\r\n\r\nAll related unit tets, CI, and build-docs pass locally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is a continuation of #39177, as while testing it noticed that when the task's state is in `TaskInstanceState.UP_FOR_RETRY`, the logs for all attempts is unavailable, when the source is served

multiple tasks, a thread pool will be created based on the number of CPU cores, and then all tasks will be consumed by the thread pool.\r\nThere are some problems with the current implementation. The scheduler creates a thread pool every time it schedules, which will bring a very large performance overhead.

promised in #39367.\r\n\r\nWe *could* arguably do this even lazier and resolve only when the items are iterated through (or accessed by index), but it seems to me if someone wants a slice of objects, they are likely to want to read at least the majority of them anyway, so it should be fine to just resolve the fetch eagerly into a list. Merging slice objects is a total pain I don't want to go through anyway.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is also added for DatasetEvent sequences to reflect the

However, this method is deemed unsafe, and it affects `DataprocSubmitJobOperator` operators, which enables external job cancellation if the triggerer restarts or crashes. This can cause weird behaviour like rescheduling deferred operators, as Airflow remains unaware of job cancellations. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, capturing `asyncio.CancelledError` cancels the job only if the TaskInstance is not in a running or deferred state. This prevents premature external job termination.\r\n\r\nMore details at: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/36090#issuecomment-2094972855\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

However, this method is deemed unsafe, and it affects `DataprocCreateClusterOperator` operators, which enables external job cancellation if the triggerer restarts or crashes. This can cause weird behaviour like rescheduling deferred operators, as Airflow remains unaware of job cancellations. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, capturing `asyncio.CancelledError` cancels the job only if the TaskInstance is not in a running or deferred state. This prevents premature external job termination.\r\n\r\nMore details at: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/36090#issuecomment-2094972855\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

However, this method is deemed unsafe, and it affects `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` operators, which enables external job cancellation if the triggerer restarts or crashes. This can cause weird behaviour like rescheduling deferred operators, as Airflow remains unaware of job cancellations. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, capturing `asyncio.CancelledError` cancels the job only if the TaskInstance is not in a running or deferred state. This prevents premature external job termination.\r\n\r\nMore details at: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/36090#issuecomment-2094972855\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the
