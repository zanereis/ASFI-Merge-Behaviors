How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n1.\r\n\r\n- Problem: \r\n when zk service is overloaded , we got a task node lost with zk connection and we can't stop tasks on the node  normally in overlord.    \r\n\r\n- Reason: \r\nthe `shutdown()`  method in `indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/overlord/RemoteTaskRunner.java` will try to stop task \r\nby invoking `findWorkerRunningTask(String taskId)`, which is depend on zk service. Obviously, it comes to a endless loop.\r\nHere is source code:\r\n```\r\n  public void shutdown(final String taskId, String reason)\r\n  {\r\n    log.info(\"Shutdown [%s] because: [%s]\", taskId, reason);\r\n    if (!lifecycleLock.awaitStarted(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\r\n      log.info(\"This TaskRunner is stopped or not yet started.

No worker running task %s\", taskId);\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n      URL url = null;\r\n      try {\r\n        url = TaskRunnerUtils.makeWorkerURL(zkWorker.getWorker(), \"/druid/worker/v1/task/%s/shutdown\", taskId);\r\n        final StatusResponseHolder response = httpClient.go(\r\n            new Request(HttpMethod.POST, url),\r\n            StatusResponseHandler.getInstance(),\r\n            shutdownTimeout\r\n        ).get();\r\n\r\n        log.info(\r\n            \"Sent shutdown message to worker: %s, status %s, response: %s\",\r\n            zkWorker.getWorker().getHost(),\r\n            response.getStatus(),\r\n            response.getContent()\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        if (!HttpResponseStatus.OK.equals(response.getStatus())) {\r\n          log.error(\"Shutdown failed for %s! Are you sure the task was running?\", taskId);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n        throw new RE(e, \"Interrupted posting shutdown to [%s] for task [%s]\", url, taskId);\r\n      }\r\n      catch (Exception e) {\r\n        throw new RE(e, \"Error in handling post to [%s] for task [%s]\", zkWorker.getWorker().getHost(), taskId);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n- solution:\r\nwhen we can't stop tasks using `findWorkerRunningTask(String taskId)`  , we try to fetch from   `runningTasks` at least.\r\n\r\n2. timeout when assign task\r\n ```\r\n      // Syncing state with Zookeeper - don't assign new tasks until the task we just assigned is actually running\r\n      // on a worker - this avoids overflowing a worker with tasks\r\n      Stopwatch timeoutStopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();\r\n      while (!isWorkerRunningTask(theZkWorker, task.getId())) {\r\n        final long waitMs = config.getTaskAssignmentTimeout().toStandardDuration().getMillis();\r\n        statusLock.wait(waitMs/3);\r\n        long elapsed = timeoutStopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n        if (elapsed >= waitMs) {\r\n          log.makeAlert(\r\n              \"Task assignment timed out on worker [%s], never ran task [%s]!

However, in a bad Network Environment ，we should try more.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

Description\r\n\r\nRunning all the tests in Travis is expensive. This PR attempts to split the tests into 2 stages so that the integration tests run only if the other tests were successful. This will allow more builds to run in parallel since the first stage tends to be faster than the integration tests (except for the intelliJ inspection check job)\r\n\r\nThis also drops `sudo` from `.travis.yml` as it has been deprecated and has no effect.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x]

is a tiny change to direct the console to use the newer example manifest file that was added here: https://github.com/apache/druid-website-src/pull/202 (please make sure that PR is merged before this one!).\r\n\r\nThe issue this solves is that https://github.com/apache/druid-website-src/blob/master/data/example-manifests.tsv had a spec that hard coded the name of the data source to `new_data_source` and the console will no longer overwrite it. This means that without this change if the user goes through the example flow and just clicks `Next` over and over (as most do) they will get a data source called `new_data_source` instead of `wikipedia` as they would have done before. This will cause needless confusion.","created_at":"2021-01-21T22:07:34Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T17:37:05Z","closed_at":"2021-01-24T20:38:13Z","merged_at":"2021-01-24T20:38:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c227bc566b5f225cd375ed697a2447e5dcca29a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to supply client certificate to dsql command line tool.\r\nIf the server is configured to do mutual SSL auth, there is no way of making dsql command line tool to work with Druid set up in this way. This PR adds the possibility to supply client certificate parameters, so that the appropriate cert is presented to server.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nAdded three new flags: `--certchain`, `--keyfile` and `--keypass`. Their values are supplied to `SSLContext`'s `load_cert_chain()` method if they're present.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.

PR fixes the following bugs\r\n- Add offsetFetchPeriod to the kinesis ingestion doc\r\n- When druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst is set to true, services fail to start due to duplicate jackson-databind dependencies in extensions.\r\n- Publish the lag with a fixed delay instead of a fixed-rate so that there is enough cooling period between successive requests\r\n- When tasks start publishing segments, the reported message gap increases even though there are no messages being read. Added a method to mark that processing is completed.\r\n- Fix the retry mechanism in kinesis connector by reusing the retry condition from AWS sdk. We were retrying only for AmazonServiceException but many retryable exceptions are of type

Adding tests\r\nFixed few bugs \r\n - Add `offsetFetchPeriod` to the kinesis ingestion doc\r\n -  When `druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst` is set to true, services fail to start due to duplicate `jackson-databind` dependencies in extensions. \r\n - Publish the lag with a fixed delay instead of a fixed-rate so that there is enough cooling period between successive requests\r\n - When tasks start publishing segments, the reported message gap increases even though there are no messages being read. Added a method to mark that processing is completed. \r\n - Fix the computation of the total number of output rows for hash partitioning ingestion\r\n - Fix the retry mechanism in kinesis connector by reusing the retry condition from AWS sdk.

Description\r\n\r\nDruid querying system returns an HTTP status code on query failures. Currently, most of query failures return an internal error (500) which could be misleading in some cases. This PR is to tidy up this and return a proper status code. Here is a list of query errors, their current status codes, and proposed changes.\r\n\r\n#### Query planning errors\r\n\r\nException | Description| Current code | Proposed new code\r\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\r\nSqlParseException and ValidationException from Calcite | Query planning failed | 500 | **400**\r\nCannotPlanException from Calcite | Failed to find the best plan. Likely an internal error | 500 | \r\nRelConversionException from Calcite | Conversion from SQL to Druid failed | 500 | \r\nCannotBuildQueryException | Failed to create a Druid native query from DruidRel. Likely an internal error | 500 | \r\nOthers | Unknown errors | 500 | \r\n\r\n#### Query execution errors\r\n\r\nException | Description| Current code | Proposed new code\r\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\r\nQueryTimeoutException | Query execution didn't finish in timeout | 504 | \r\nUnauthorized exception | Authentication failed to execute the query | 401 | \r\nForbiddenException | Authorization failed to execute the query | 403 | \r\nQueryCapacityExceededException | Query failed to schedule because of the lack of resources available at the time when the query was submitted | 429 | \r\nResourceLimitExceededException | Query asked more resources than configured threshold | 500 | **400**\r\nInsufficientResourceException | Query failed to schedule because of lack of merge buffers available at the time when it was submitted | 500 | **429**, merged to QueryCapacityExceededException\r\nQueryUnsupportedException | Unsupported functionality | 400 | **501**\r\nOthers | Unknown exceptions | 500 | \r\n\r\n`BadQueryException` is added to represent all kinds of query exceptions that should return 400.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where queries with subtotals and limits can have incorrect results due to the way which `LimitedBufferHashGrouper` operates, using a min-max heap which is destroyed upon iteration, while subtotals require multiple iterations on the same grouper with different dimension sets.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can exploit that the min-max heap is stored as a contiguous array, and the continual removal of the min element (which is the first element of the backing array) and subsequent rebalance of the heap that follows will leave the a newly freed space at the end of the array, allowing us to write the sorted array of offsets in reverse. Subsequent iterators can then just provide the reverse ordered array.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate with an example, here is how the min-max heap normally behaves (with the data in the backing buffer included)\r\n```\r\nadding 1\r\n[1] backing-array:[1]\r\nadding 2\r\n[1, 2] backing-array:[1, 2]\r\nadding 3\r\n[1, 2, 3] backing-array:[1, 2, 3]\r\nadding 5\r\n[1, 5, 3, 2] backing-array:[1, 5, 3, 2]\r\nadding 8\r\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 5] backing-array:[1, 8, 3, 2, 5]\r\nremoved min: 1\r\n[2, 8, 3, 5] backing-array:[2, 8, 3, 5, 5]\r\nremoved min: 2\r\n[3, 8, 5] backing-array:[3, 8, 5, 5, 5]\r\nremoved min: 3\r\n[5, 8] backing-array:[5, 8, 5, 5, 5]\r\nremoved min: 5\r\n[8] backing-array:[8, 8, 5, 5, 5]\r\nremoved min: 8\r\n[] backing-array:[8, 8, 5, 5, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the same set of operations, but with back-filling the sorted array as we remove the heap:\r\n```\r\nadding 1\r\n[1] backing-array:[1]\r\nadding 2\r\n[1, 2] backing-array:[1, 2]\r\nadding 3\r\n[1, 2, 3] backing-array:[1, 2, 3]\r\nadding 5\r\n[1, 5, 3, 2] backing-array:[1, 5, 3, 2]\r\nadding 8\r\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 5] backing-array:[1, 8, 3, 2, 5]\r\nremoved min: 1 set position: 4\r\n[2, 8, 3, 5] backing-array:[2, 8, 3, 5, 1]\r\nremoved min: 2 set position: 3\r\n[3, 8, 5] backing-array:[3, 8, 5, 2, 1]\r\nremoved min: 3 set position: 2\r\n[5, 8] backing-array:[5, 8, 3, 2, 1]\r\nremoved min: 5 set position: 1\r\n[8] backing-array:[8, 5, 3, 2, 1]\r\nremoved min: 8 set position: 0\r\n[] backing-array:[8, 5, 3, 2, 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't believe that new offsets will be added to this heap _after_ it has been iterated, but could not definitively prove it, so I took a perhaps aggressive approach and decided that this should be an exception state. The previous behavior was likely broken, since iterating the heap is destructive, adding a new offset and then iterating again would result in an iterator which only produced the new offset. I did not want to preserve this behavior, but it would be possible if it is correct for some reason (no other grouper behaves like this afaict).\r\n\r\nIf adding new offsets does legitimately happen after iteration, when adding a new offset after the grouper has been iterated we could re-heapify from the sorted array, prior to adding the new offset to the rebuilt heap. I didn't want to add the extra code for this unless strictly necessary, so an exception will rather noisily let us know that it happens and we need to make this change, but it should be easy enough to do if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThe `UniformGranularitySpec` currently materializes all intervals when it is constructed. This may cause OOM in the Overlord and other modules whenever the resulting interval list is very large. The changes here should avoid that materialization in all places in the overlord for the `UniformGranularitySpec`.  There is still one method in the unform granularity spec, `public Optional<Interval> bucketInterval(DateTime dt)` that materializes all the intervals but care is taken that the intervals are not materialized unless that particular method is invoked. Since this method is only called outside the Overlord the OOM issues should be less drastic than they are today.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\nA public API change was made to the interface `GranularitySpec`. Now the method `bucketIntervals()` returns a `Iterable<Interval>` rather than a materialized set of intervals as it used to return before this change. The other significant change was to avoid materialization of the intervals in the constructor of the `UniformGranularitySpec`.\r\n\r\nMost of the work is delegated to a new helper class `IntervalsByGranularity` which takes a Collection of intervals and a Granularity in its constructor to build an Iterator avoiding the materialization of the intervals. This class also ensures that the intervals returned by the iterator are appropriately sorted. Then this class is used in the critical places were materialization was taken place. The class `ArbitraryGranularitySpec` still materializes all intervals so use the one with care.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

byte calculation for maxBytesInMemory to take into account of Sink/Hydrant Object overhead\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFix byte calculation for maxBytesInMemory to take into account of Sink/Hydrant Object overhead.\r\nAssumption / Estimation made:\r\n- Estimated that each Sink object (not including the `currHydrant` and list of `hydrant`) has an overhead of 5000 bytes (`Sink.ROUGH_OVERHEAD_PER_SINK`) each. This estimation is based on actual heap dumps from actual ingestions. i.e. one sink with 1000 rows and 1000 sink with 1 row (same rows values) will now result in different byte in memory usage calculation. \r\n- Estimated that each 'hydrant' of memory mapped segment (after persisted) has an overhead of the formula  `Integer.BYTES + (4 * Short.BYTES) + 1000 + (NumColumnsOfHydrant * ColumnHolder.ROUGH_OVERHEAD_PER_COLUMN_HOLDER)` bytes (where ColumnHolder.ROUGH_OVERHEAD_PER_COLUMN_HOLDER=1000 bytes).  i.e. one sink with one hydrant having 1000 rows and one sink with 1000 hydrant (each with one row) (same rows values) will now result in different byte in memory usage calculation.\r\n\r\nBoth of the above can cause OOM during ingestion when we have a lot of sink and a lot of persisting. More specifically, the problem is serious when each persist happens across a huge number of sinks. Hence, the OOM usually occurs with big time range and/or small segmentGranularity couple with unsorted time data).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

#9816 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n***Note***: I use the term \"Guild\" throughout this proposal. It is an arbitrary name that I chose for the Historical grouping construct that I am proposing. A Guild would be a group of Historical servers. All servers who do not specify a Guild in runtime.properties would be assigned to a default Guild.\r\n\r\nI am adding the idea of guilds in Druid. A guild is a logical grouping of servers. With this PR, the only use of guilds is replicant distribution across Historical Servers. The idea has been born out of the desire for HDFS like rack aware replication for bare metal deployment on-prem. For this use case, Druid Historical services are assigned a guild based on the physical rack that they live on. The coordinator uses SegmentReplicantLookup to build a lookup for segment:guild replicant count. The Coordinator has a preference for loading replicants across 2 or more guilds. It is important to note that, instead of having less replicants than specified by Druid Load Rules, the Coordinator will load replicants on the same guild if it must.\r\n\r\nThis idea can go beyond just physical racks in a data center and apply to things such as availability zones or arbitrary historical server groupings in a virtualized deployment. That is why I came up with the name \"guild\" instead of just saying rack explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n**Configs**\r\nruntime.properties:\r\n* `druid.server.guild` The STRING guild name assigned to a server. Default value applied if not specified, `_default_guild`.\r\n* `druid.coordinator.guildReplication.on` The BOOLEAN flag telling the coordinator if it should use server guilds as a part of its coordination logic. Default value is `false`.\r\n\r\ncoordinator dynamic config:\r\n* `guildReplicaitonMaxPercentOfSegmentsToMove` What % of segments moved during BalanceSegments duty should be dedicated to moving segments that are not meeting guild replication threshold of 2? This is applied against what is left over after moving segments off of decommissioning servers, if there are any. Default value is `0`.\r\n* `emitGuildReplicationMetrics` Boolean whether or not to emit metrics for guild replication status. This PR adds one metric that is a count of segments not loaded onto multiple guilds.\r\n\r\n**Code Changes** \r\n\r\n> SegmentReplicantLookup\r\n\r\nThe coordinator currently builds this object each time the `HistoricalManagementDuties` run. Prior to this proposal, the object would contain two main data structures:\r\n\r\n`Table<SegmentId, String, Integer> segmentsInCluster` - replicant count for each segment by tier for segments served by the cluster.\r\n`Table<SegmentId, String, Integer> loadingSegments` - replicant count for each segment by tier for segments being loaded by the cluster. \r\n\r\nMy proposal adds a third data structure that is specific to guild replication:\r\n\r\n`Table<SegmentId, String, Integer> historicalGuildDistribution` - replicant count for each segment by guild.\r\n\r\nThis new structure is only created if guild replication is enabled. It is not worth the resources if we are not going to use it! The structure is used for quick lookup to get guild replication state for a given segment. It will be used by coordinator duties when making decisions on loading/moving/dropping segments. \r\n\r\n> LoadRule\r\n\r\nWhen Assigning replicas, use the changes in SegmentReplicantLookup in order to split `ServerHolders` into groups of servers who are on a guild that is serving a replicant of the segment and servers who are on a guild that is not serving a replicant of the segment. If possible `LoadRule` will load replicants to the best scored server(s) from the guild(s) not serving a replicant. However, we always fallback to just loading the specified number of replicants even if replication across guilds cannot be achieved.\r\n\r\nWhen picking replicants to drop, we will also split the `ServerHolders` in the same way. The segments will be dropped from decommissioning servers first, then from servers on guilds with > 1 replicant of the segment, then lastly from the remaining servers serving a replicant.\r\n\r\n> Balancer Strategy\r\n\r\nAdd a method to the interface. `pickGuildReplicationViolatingSegmentToMove(List<ServerHolder> serverHolders, Set<String> broadcastDataSources, DruidCoordinatorRuntimeParams params);`\r\n\r\nThis new method is added so we have the `SegmentReplicantLookup` information needed to pick a segment who is not replicated across > 1 guild when balancing the cluster. It is needed because we introduce the dynamic config and associated balancing phase in BalanceSegments that prioritizes the balancing of segments who are not properly replicated across guilds. We need to only pick segments that meet the requirements. The existing `pickSegmentToMove` does not suffice.\r\n\r\nRandomBalancerStrategy and CostBalancerStrategy add implementations.\r\n\r\n> ReservoirSegmentSampler\r\n\r\nAdds a method for getting a `SegmentHolder` that is violator of the goal of being on > 1 guilds. This method needs to have access to the `SegmentReplicantLookup` in order to quickly look up replication state of segments it is possibly selecting. It returns the first violator that it finds or null if none is found.\r\n\r\n> BalanceSegments\r\n\r\nThe coordinator balancing duty gets a couple of changes. The first change is to the generic balancing that exists today. If guild replication is enabled, then we will perform the split of `ServerHolders` based on their guild replication status when looking for a server to move a segment to. Just as in `LoadRule` we will do our best to make the move to a server that improves or maintains the number of guilds that hold a replicant.\r\n\r\nWe also add a new phase of balancing segments. There is a dedicated move for segments off of decommissioning servers. An operator can also choose to add a dedicated move for segments that are not replicated on > 1 guild. They do this by editing the dynamic coordinator config that this proposal adds. This results in the coordinator moving a certain number of segments that are violating guild replication rules. It is an optional way for an operator to speed up the balancing of segments across guilds.\r\n\r\n### Design Choice Rationale + Alternatives\r\n\r\nThere has been some feedback that this functionality should be folded into the tier construct that already exists. I tend to disagree with that idea for multiple reasons.\r\n* Tiers have been around for a long time and have become cornerstones of operator's deployments. It may not be easy or straightforward to re-purpose tiers to also work as generic replication groups. I fear we'd be creating a single monster that is hard to understand vs having two separate concepts split out into their own things (guilds vs tiers)\r\n* As written, tiers are explicit. I load N replicants onto Tier A, M onto Tier B, etc. Whereas guild replication is a generic best effort goal. I try to load the aggregate replicants across all tiers onto 2 or more guilds. We can't change tiers to be generic with loading to go across 2 or more tiers, because operators expect their load rules to be followed to a T. So we end up with competing goals that do not play nicely together. This ties back to my point that trying to adapt tiering to meet so many goals could create a confusing beast.\r\n* My motivating goal for uptime and maintainability may require a separate grouping outside of my existing tiering. Perhaps servers for my different tiers are mixed and matched within logical groupings that I would need to separate out in order to achieve my motivating goals. If my grouping for uptime and maintainability is in regards to physical racks. I could have my slow and fast servers racked on the same set of racks with a few of each form-factor on any given rack. This means I cannot achieve my same tiers for my speed tiering as well as my replication goals. I would need to further split each rack into tiers, which once again is getting complex and probably messing up performance by adding way too much isolation vs shared resources.\r\n\r\nSo now that adapting tiering is ruled out as far as I am concerned, what else could we do? I can't think of other solutions for the configurations that are as generic as my simple guild name assignment and boolean for the coordinator on whether or not to follow guild replication logic paths. But what about the implementation details using these configurations? It could certainly be argued that the cost of the new `SegmentReplicantLookup` data structure is too steep for large clusters. However, I fail to come up with a better solution in my head. When we are choosing servers to load/drop segments from, we need a quick way to look up details on where that segment is loaded. It seems logical that this facility would require this large structure in the replicant lookup.\r\n\r\nWith all this being said, I am open to improvements to my proposal. At the end of the day my motivating factors just need to be achieved. If there is a better way to achieve the simple goals required, I'm all for it. \r\n\r\n### Operational impact of deployment\r\n\r\n**- Is anything going to be deprecated or removed by this change? How will we phase out old behavior?**\r\n\r\nNothing is deprecated or removed.\r\n\r\n**- Is there a migration path that cluster operators need to be aware of?**\r\n\r\nTo go from not using guild replication, to using guild replication, there will be a simple migration path. Operators will need to assign guilds to their historical servers and restart them. They will then have to flip the coordinator config to turn on guild replication. They may choose to use the coordinator dynamic config to speed up balancing based on guild replication if they so choose.\r\n\r\n**- Will there be any effect on the ability to do a rolling upgrade, or to do a rolling _downgrade_ if an operator wants to switch back to a previous version?**\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the first version of druid that has guild replication in it will not require any special work. Upgrading to the default configs will keep guild replication off. If they choose to use guild replication, they can perform the migration steps after the upgrade. If they choose not to use guild replication, no action is needed! Downgrading would require a pre-step by an operator if they have already turned guild replication on. They would need to turn guild replication off on the coordinator by updating their config and restarting it. That way there will not be any issues with split versions across coordinator/historical during downgrade.\r\n\r\n**- Other**\r\n\r\nThis change as proposed results in additional resource utilization by the Coordinator. Extra data structures are created in `SegmentReplicantLookup` that help make replicant loading decisions based on guild distribution of segments. This may require attention from operators as far as configuring their runtime environment for the coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe changed as proposed introduces a major change to the decision making process by the Coordinator. Enabling guild aware replication may result in replicant loading decisions that the coordinator would have previously considered sub-optimal. Loading replicants to different guilds to gain better uptime and maintainability standards could result in segment distribution skew that negatively impacts performance. It is a trade-off that an operator will need to carefully consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\n`AbstractBatchIndexTask.tryTimeChunkLock()` is called `isReady()` which is called in the Overlord to check if the task is ready for execution. Since the Overlord only checks the result of `isReady()` but does nothing with locks by itself, locking individual interval can lead to deadlock. Imagine that there are two tasks that want to work on overlapping intervals. One task could lock some of intervals but failed for others for some reason. Later, another task could lock those intervals where the first task failed to lock. Now they would wait for each other to release locks they possess. \r\n\r\n~~This PR changes to lock an umbrella interval of the input intervals instead of locking them individually. This is an easy fix, but I'm not sure if it's the best. Maybe the Overlord should take care of those tasks who are not ready yet and release any locks they acquired during `isReady()`. This approach will work better when the input intervals are not consecutive (the approach locking an umbrella interval will unnecessarily lock some intervals even though the task doesn't need them). We can get back to this approach when this turns out to be an issue.~~\r\n\r\nI found the better approach is not that hard to implement. Updated this PR and now `TaskQueue` cleans up all locks automatically if `Task.isReady()` returns false.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

modified the `MonitorScheduler` to use `CronScheduler` instead of `ScheduledExecutorService`. This change looks good to me except that I'm not sure how well-tested `CronScheduler` is. This PR adds the previous `ScheduledExecutorService`-based `MonitorScheduler` back, and a new config, `druid.monitoring.schedulerClassName`, to determine what type of `MonitorScheduler` to use. This PR also changes the default `MonitorScheduler`  back to `BasicMonitorScheduler`. Some brave users may want to explore the new `ClockDriftSafeMonitorScheduler`. The new config is intentionally not documented as we will get rid of it once the new scheduler is proven to be safe. However, it should be called out in the release notes.\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally fixes 3 bugs in `MonitorScheduler`.\r\n- When an exception is thrown in `monitor.monitor()`, the behaviour has changed unexpectedly to stop the monitor. The monitor will ignore exceptions and continue working after this PR as it used to do.\r\n- There is a race condition between [when a scheduledFuture is set in a monitor](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10448/files#diff-e1da51fa67513b22b8110a76b29aa3c5cc8d00de418d7e5afc498c3bc3a8f107R178) and [when the scheduledFuture is used](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10448/files#diff-e1da51fa67513b22b8110a76b29aa3c5cc8d00de418d7e5afc498c3bc3a8f107R153). This will not likely happen in production since the first cronTask will be executed after the emitter period, but is possible in theory.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10448 changed to use 64 threads for monitoring which seems an overkill to me. This PR changed it back to use a single thread.\r\n\r\nAn additional change is that a new monitor task will not be scheduled if there is a previous one still running. For example, there is a monitor task which took 3 seconds to complete for some reason. In this case, there will be only one set of metrics emitted during these 3 seconds which are captured when a monitor task started. I think this is OK because we can avoid the growing queue in the scheduler even though some metrics can be missing.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Kafka message support in streaming indexing tasks is limited to\r\nmessage values, and does not provide a way to expose Kafka headers,\r\ntimestamps, or keys, which may be of interest to more specialized\r\nDruid input formats. For instance, Kafka headers may be used to indicate\r\npayload format/encoding or additional metadata, and timestamps are often\r\nomitted from values in Kafka streams applications, since they are\r\nincluded in the record.\r\n\r\nThis change proposes to introduce KafkaRecordEntity as InputEntity,\r\nwhich would give input formats full access to the underlying Kafka record,\r\nincluding headers, key, timestamps. It would also open access to low-level\r\ninformation such as topic, partition, offset if needed.\r\n\r\nKafkaEntity is a subclass of ByteEntity for backwards compatibility with\r\nexisting input formats, and to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity\r\nfor Kinesis indexing

The new config value `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove` requires a value of 1 - 100. Default is 100. However on upgrade the coordinator will load the dynamic config from metastore using `CoordinatorDynamicConfig` for deserialization. Since the config will not have existed pre-upgrade, it will be null for the constructor which violates the precondition check on the value. This would cause the code to load the Builder default of CoordinatorDynamicConfig at startup. I believe this is undesirable. Instead we want Druid to load the existing persisted config with the default for the new config while logging a warn to the operator telling them their persisted config is out of date. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

#10719.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen javascript filter direct return js function result(like `return [1, 2, 3].includes(4);`), it seems the filter not take effect，but change it to `return [1, 2, 3].includes(4) == true;`, the result is correct.\r\nI found the js engine(rhino)'s return type of the former usage is  `org.mozilla.javascript.NativeBoolean`, and `Context.toBoolean` will treat it as true even though the value is false! The return type of the latter is `java.lang.Boolean`, it will behave correctly.\r\nSo I add a convert js function, convert `org.mozilla.javascript.NativeBoolean` to `java.lang.Boolean`, so that `Context.toBoolean` will return the correct result.\r\n\r\n### Another Fix Way\r\nAnd there may be have another way to fix this problem, only add `context.setLanguageVersion(Context.VERSION_1_2);`.But not sure which way has lower influence.\r\nThis problem(or feature?) has described in rhino's document: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino/Overview#ToBoolean.\r\n> ToBoolean\r\n> Boolean(new Boolean(false)) is false for all versions before 1.3.

goal of this PR is to provide additional metrics that track the reliability of clients from the broker. In another [PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10427), we have extend the ServerSelectorStrategy to filter available servers to increase success rate. This is because the CachingClusteredClient uniformly distributes queries across historicals with segment replicas, so one misbehaving server will cause the entire query to fail. This is discussed in this [issue](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10602)\r\n\r\nThis approach is to extend DirectDruidClient slightly to add a limited history of the HTTP Response Codes from historical and real time servers. DirectDruidClient already maintains the number of open connections and it is responsible for making requests against the query servers, so it seems like an appropriate place to add additional statistics. DirectDruidClient is available to the ServerSelectorStrategy already as the QueryRunner for the servers and the other changes can be localized to DirectDruidClient, minimizing the changes to the core Druid codebase. If statistics on the reliability of servers can be made available at the ServerSelectorStrategy level (either through an extension like this or e.g. injecting BrokerServerView) then the filtering can be added without any other core changes. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of alternatives to collect this data. Errors can be collected with a QueryRunner that catches QueryExceptions, but successful requests are harder to capture because that information doesn't surface at the QueryRunner level.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the interval used in CachingQueryRunner by CacheUtil.computeSegmentCacheKey() is the intersection of query interval and Segment interval from segment identifier.\r\nIt's better to use the intersection of query interval and the actual dataInterval of the segment(the min/max data time in the segment, not the interval in the segment identifier).\r\n\r\nFor example, when the segment granularity is DAY and there are many partitions built by realtime tasks :\r\ndatasource_name1_2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z_2020-12-29T00:00:00.000Z_2020-12-28T00:00:00.505Z:

\r\n\r\nThe actual min/max time in these segments are:\r\n00:09:00 ~ 00:37:22\r\n01:11:34 ~ 01:45:43\r\n02:04:22 ~ 02:54:12\r\n\r\nCurrently, the first query with query interval 00:00:00/02:14:19 populates a cache with interval 00:00:00/02:14:19 in cache key.\r\nthe next query with query interval 00:00:00/02:15:19 can't reuse the cache populated by the first query, as we know the actual result is the same, due to '00:00:00/02:14:19' used in the cache key.\r\n\r\nFor this case, the interval used in cache key should be changed to 00:09:00/00:37:22, 01:11:34/01:45:43, 02:04:22/02:14:19\r\n\r\nThis change will not break any contract, because of `Interval actualInterval = interval.overlap(dataInterval);` in `makeCursors()` in `IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter` and `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

This type will cause exception when using JSON.stringify. I fix it by cast value which is bigInt to string.\r\nWhen use Kafka as datasource, task payload will contains some partition information. If partition has a large offset, it will trigger this bug like this:\r\n<img width=\"1491\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-25 at 4 35 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24642075/103128194-4b463900-46cf-11eb-9c1b-b6e072a739b1.png\">\r\nUse this commit, correct content will display, like this:\r\n<img width=\"1495\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-25 at 4 30 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24642075/103128248-8fd1d480-46cf-11eb-95b5-409c962ab8ee.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\n**Compressed Big Decimal** is an extension which provides support for Mutable big decimal value that can be used to accumulate values without losing precision or reallocating memory. This type helps in absolute precision arithmetic on large numbers in applications, where  greater level of accuracy is required, such as financial applications, currency based transactions.  This helps avoid rounding issues where in potentially large amount of money can be lost.\r\n\r\nAccumulation requires that the two numbers have the same scale, but does not require that they are  of the same size. If the value being accumulated has a larger underlying array than this value (the result), then the higher order bits are dropped, similar to  what happens when adding a long to an int and storing the result in an int. A compressed big decimal that holds its data with an embedded array.\r\n\r\nCompressed big decimal is an absolute number based complex type based on big decimal in Java. This supports all the functionalities supported by Java Big Decimal.  Java Big Decimal is not mutable in order to avoid big garbage collection issues.   Compressed big decimal is needed to mutate the value in the accumulator.\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to the Issue https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10668.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nDruid is like, absurdly extensible, which is pretty cool. Extensions are able to create entire new standalone tools and even full services, and they can be quite powerful because they have access to the wealth of facilities provided by the Druid codebase. However, they are not currently able to announce or discover themselves because we use a `NodeRole` enumeration which limits participation to known service types.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `NodeRole` to instead be a class, mimicking the contract the enum provided so that there is no apparent change, and allowing custom `NodeRoles` to be used alongside the built-in service types. I've added an integration test that tests discovery and self discovery (`/status/selfDiscovered`, which wasn't previously covered by tests afaict) of both the built-in node types as well as an additional custom node-role service extension.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #10606.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nPlease reference the proposal for detailed information. I will provide a summary here:\r\n\r\nI am proposing an optional new DutiesRunnable in the DruidCoordinator. Operators can choose whether or not to break primary replicant loading out into its own DutiesRunnable. If they choose not to enable the dedicated primary replicant loading, their coordinator will function just as it always has. If they choose to enable the dedicated primary replicant loading, their coordinator will add a scheduled DutiesRunnable dedicated to executing matching LoadRule for segments and only doing the primary replicant load for that LoadRule when ran. The HistoricalManagement DutiesRunnable will continue all other HistoricalManagement duties including performing non-primary replicant loading and replicant dropping while executing a matched LoadRule for a segment.\r\n\r\nMy implementation for the proposal exposes two new Coordinator runtime configurations for operators: druid.coordinator.loadPrimaryReplicantSeparately and druid.coordinator.period.primaryReplicantLoaderPeriod. If they choose to enable the first, then a scheduled executor with a configurable backoff period is configured for loading primary replicants.\r\n\r\nI am marking this with Design Review label because the proposal never got the traction I wanted to confirm the design. Thus, this will require 2 +1's from committers before merge.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

of now, if the left query in the JOIN has a filter present, we plan it as the join between two query data sources even if the left source is a base table. This is of course not efficient. We had even introduced some custom calcite rules so that filters on join query are not pushed into the children tables. This issue is more significant for correlated queries since the generated physical plan is a left join with a filter on the left base table. Hence, the execution of correlation queries is not efficient. \r\nThis PR adds the support for pushing filters into the left child. We would add the support for the right child in a different PR and also get rid of the custom calcite rules once that happens. \r\nWhat does not work\r\n - Partitioning pruning based on left filter of join table\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

kinesis integration test\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis is a followup to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10692\r\nTurns out that I merge https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10692 in too soon and that the Kinesis integration test can still fail intermittently. This PR should now really fix it. (Verify by 20 consecutive passing of the Kinesis IT group.)\r\nThere were two causes for Kinesis intermittent failure:\r\n1) Part of the Kinesis IT verify ingested data after the ingestion task completed (so that segments are loaded onto historical and are no longer \"realtime\". The test was doing this by terminating the supervisor to force the ingestion task to complete. However, it seems like there might be a bug that causes the running ingestion task to become stuck and continue running even after the supervisor terminated.\r\n2) Some part of Kinesis IT may take some time to successfully verify the result. The current timeout/retry count can be too low. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these issues by:\r\n1) Decrease task duration to 30 seconds. The test will then wait until task naturally complete and handoff segments to historical (instead of terminating the supervisor to force task to complete).\r\n2) Increase retry timeout to 20 minutes from 10 minutes. This is done by increasing retry count from 120 to 240.\r\nThis PR also includes some nice to have:\r\n1) Update API for terminating supervisor to use `/terminate` since `/shutdown` is deprecated.\r\n2) Add shutdown task API call to test teardown to make sure that we also properly clean up all task\r\n3) Update some logging to provide more information in case of test failure\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

It's very relevant to know that that multi-value dimensions are sorted by default and that it's possible to change this behaviour. \r\n\r\nTo someone more intune with Druid's inner workings: Do we really want alphabetical sorted to be the default for MV dimensions?

Kinesis Integration tests\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running the whole Kinesis Integration test group, some of the tests in \"parallel mode\" are failing. The tests failed as some task are never completed. This can be due to either multiple tests running at the same time taking up too many task slots resulting in a dead lock and/or multiple tests running at the same time taking up too much memory/resource resulting in the node crashing. The simply solution taken here is to move those tests into the SerializedTest file to be run serially. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

PR introduces a new tuning config parameter, `maxColumnsToMerge`. \r\n\r\nThis functions as a limit on how many segments can be merged at the same time by the IndexMerger, to limit memory usage during the merge. When the column limit is exceeded across a set of segments, the IndexMerger will break the segments to be merged into smaller phases, and merge the smaller phases in a tree. \r\n\r\nA minimum of 2 segments will be merged at once, regardless of the limit. If there is only 1 segment being merged, the limit does not apply. (A warning is logged in these cases, but merging is allowed to proceed).\r\n\r\nCurrently only the native batch and parallel ingest task tuning config have this new parameter added, this PR does not add support for it to Kafka/Kinesis ingestion yet.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\nThe feature mentioned in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6988 is very useful and can greatly improve the speed of historical node restart. But there are some potential risks due to push the loading work to query time.\r\n\r\nIf segment files like `meta.smoosh` or `data.smoosh` **which Historical is served already** are damaged, Historical with lazyOnStart enable can restart successfully but will not detect file corruption during restarting. When queries hit these damaged files, these queries will fail and will not expose which specific files are damaged like mentioned in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10608\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nHere are the undamaged segment files.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1104\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-12-17 下午6 29 49\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/102495896-a9609400-40b1-11eb-8bbe-5583dfc054cb.png\">\r\n\r\n#### First case : meta.smoosh is damaged, for example\r\nRemove a line `video_cro_network_name,0,997718245,1000412345` in that meta.smoosh file.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"415\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-12-17 下午6 33 27\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/102495917-af567500-40b1-11eb-924d-fcfd343ef50d.png\">\r\n\r\nRestart Historical node with lazy on start enable.\r\n\r\n#### Second case : data.smoosh is damaged, for example\r\nDelete several bytes in that 00000.smoosh file randomly.\r\nRestart Historical node with lazy on start enable.\r\n\r\n**_In all scenarios, Historical can restart successfully, but queries will failed._**\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-11-26T10:56:14,031 INFO [DruidSchema-Cache-0] org.apache.druid.server.log.LoggingRequestLogger - 2020-11-26T10:56:14.026Z\t\t{\"queryType\":\"segmentMetadata\",\"dataSource\":{\"type\":\"table\",\"name\":\"traffic__ops_feed__realtime__second__dev__lazy__test\"},\"intervals\":{\"type\":\"segments\",\"segments\":[{\"itvl\":\"2020-11-26T03:00:00.000Z/2020-11-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"ver\":\"2020-11-26T03:30:17.710Z\",\"part\":0},{\"itvl\":\"2020-11-26T03:00:00.000Z/2020-11-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"ver\":\"2020-11-26T03:30:17.710Z\",\"part\":1},{\"itvl\":\"2020-11-26T03:00:00.000Z/2020-11-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"ver\":\"2020-11-26T03:30:17.710Z\",\"part\":2},{\"itvl\":\"2020-11-26T03:00:00.000Z/2020-11-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"ver\":\"2020-11-26T03:30:17.710Z\",\"part\":3},{\"itvl\":\"2020-11-26T03:00:00.000Z/2020-11-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"ver\":\"2020-11-26T03:30:17.710Z\",\"part\":4},{\"itvl\":\"2020-11-26T03:00:00.000Z/2020-11-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"ver\":\"2020-11-26T03:30:17.710Z\",\"part\":5}]},\"toInclude\":{\"type\":\"all\"},\"merge\":false,\"context\":{\"queryId\":\"a022fbbf-d2fa-408b-bd21-698645c74f62\"},\"analysisTypes\":[],\"usingDefaultInterval\":false,\"lenientAggregatorMerge\":false,\"descending\":false,\"granularity\":{\"type\":\"all\"}}\t{\"query/time\":4,\"query/bytes\":-1,\"success\":false,\"identity\":\"allowAll\",\"exception\":\"java.lang.RuntimeException: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.io.JsonEOFException: Unexpected end-of-input: expected close marker for Array (start marker at [Source: (SequenceInputStream);

calculating the results for a subtotal spec, we reuse the buffer iterator that was used in the base query. However, not all the implementations of such iterators are reusable. Specifically, LimitedBufferHashGrouper#iterator is one of those non-reusable iterators. This results in subtotal specs not working if there is also a limit used as part of the query. \r\n\r\nThis PR deeps copy some shared state in the iterator `makeHeapIteratormethod` to make sure that it is reusable. It also added a unit test to verify that it can be reused now.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n* Issue is that `makeHeapIteratormethod` copies overwrite some shared state\r\n* Solution in this ticket is to

Description\r\nThis PR adds integration tests that try to get some coverage of coordinator and overlord leadership changes, using queries against system tables and then cycling which containers are running and forcing leadership changes. The goal is to get some coverage for `DruidLeadershipClient` in the integration tests and avoid any sort of regressions if possible. Once kubernetes integration tests are in place, I imagine we could run these tests against k8s discovery instead of curator based as well since #10544 has now gone in.\r\n\r\nTo aid in my sanity while testing this stuff, I have added `is_leader` to `sys.servers` which is a long column which returns `1` if the server is the leader and 0 if it is not (for coordinators and overlords), and for services which do not have the concept of leadership, will return the default long value (0 in default mode, null if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`).\r\n\r\nThe integration tests add a new test group, 'high-availability', which has a special docker-compose file that brings up a cluster with 1 router, 1 broker, 2 overlords, and 2 coordinators (and zk/kafka and metadata store). The tests check which containers are the leader, issues some system tables queries which should flex the leadership clients to both the current overlord and coordinator leaders, and then restart the containers to force leadership change, repeating this process a few times.\r\n\r\nI modified the base docker-compose file to specify the hostnames to the container names, and set `druid.host` to the same, so that the tests could refer to hosts by hostname instead of container IP address (which is what druid.host defaults to if not specified otherwise). This was because I also had to plumb this through to the integration test config so that I could fill in the correct internal host information for test code and query/expected response templates.\r\n\r\nIn other docker stuffs, I removed many of the `links` sections of the docker-compose file for integration tests, which afaict is deprecated and not necessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, I fixed a funny race condition that i think could really only happen when doing something like this in docker and starting multiple coordinators at the same time, which would have a race condition when trying to initialize the basic auth extension default auth stuffs, where both containers would detect that it had not been initialized, one would lose the race, and explode out of lifecycle start causing the service to die before starting. This probably isn't a big deal even in a real system because if the process gets started again it would succeed because it would be initialized on the 2nd pass, but our integration test configs do not auto-restart (which is noisy on purpose I think), so instead I just wrapped the initialization in a retry which will skip and continue startup if the duplicate initialization explosion is detected.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

for release notes***\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to tell a batch ingestion task to wait for newly indexed segments to become available for query on Historical services before completing. This is turned off by default. If an end user wants their task to wait a specified amount of time for their segments to become available before the task completes, they must add `awaitSegmentAvailabilityTimeoutMillis` to the tuningConfig in their ingestion spec. If an end user adds this to their spec, the job will query the coordinator periodically checking to see if the desired segments have become available for query. If not all segments become available by the time this timeout expires, the job will still succeed. However, in the IngestionStatsAndErrors report, `segmentAvailabilityConfirmed` will be false. This indicates that handoff was not successful and these newly indexed segments may not all be available for query. On the other hand, if all segments become available for query on the Historical services before the timeout expires, the value for that key in the report will be true.\r\n\r\nThis tuningConfig value is not supported for compaction tasks at this time. If a user tries to specify a value for `awaitSegmentAvailabilityTimeoutMillis` for Compaction, the task will fail telling the user it is not supported.\r\n\r\n***end update***\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### High Level Description\r\n\r\nAdd configuration in `tuningConfig` for end user to tell Indexing Service to wait for segments to become available for query before completing the indexing task. The configuration is a timeout value in milliseconds to prevent waiting forever. If the timeout expires, the task still succeeds, but the task reports will indicate that Druid was not able to confirm that the segments became available for query.\r\n\r\nThis new configuration stems from my experience operating a production cluster with many tenants who often have the same complaint: \"My indexing job is complete but the latest data is not available right when the job finishes\". This addresses that by letting the client set a reasonable timeout. After the job completes, they can parse the ingestion report and see if their segments became available. More often than not, with a reasonable timeout, their segments will indeed be available right when the job completes.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\nA lot of the code is already written for realtime handoffs. I extracted that code out of the realtime packages into a Java package so it is less confusing as to why non-realtime tasks are using it. `org.apache.druid.segment.handoff` is a new package in `druid-server` module.\r\n\r\n`AbstractBatchIndexTask` gets a new method, `waitForSegmentAvailability(TaskToolbox toolbox, ExecutorService exec, List<DataSegment> segmentsToWaitFor, long waitTimeout)` that handles the waiting. Batch Indexing implementations leverage this method at the end of their ingestion task code if the client's tuningConfig has a non-zero wait time for segment availability. Default is to not wait.\r\n\r\nA new key:value pair is added to the IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReport `segmentAvailabilityConfirmed`. This is a boolean that indicates if the job was able to confirm query availability of the new segments before finishing. Parallel index task supervisor did not previously have this report, so this PR adds the report with the needed availability key:value pair so all of simple native, parallel native, and hadoop native can implement this availability wait.\r\n\r\n#### Alternatives\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/releases#19-datasource-loadstatus became available in druid 0.20.0. However, I worry about giving ingestion clients the green light to hit this API endpoint due to the possible expense of the calls depending on the questions asked.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Launched/Destroyed a Druid Cluster on Minikube locally with a script.\r\n2.Tested `ingest -> load segment -> query`. And it works fine.\r\n\r\nAlthough It is in `WIP`\r\nThere are some bugs need to be fixed, such as \r\n1. `Permissions issue`\r\n2. Integration with travis: It seems that I can't set `hostNetWork` in statefuleset using druid-operator. So I have to use `NodePort Service` to expose Druid service like router, middleManager and so on but only can use ports 30000-32767. \r\nSo I perform integration tests in `int-tests-config-file` mentioned  https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/integration-tests/README.md\r\n3. Pod resource adjust including disks.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Updated:\r\nThis PR add a new IT Job `71`:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a K8s cluster based on minikube.\r\n2. Deploy Druid cluster on K8s: single Druid, use local disk as Deep Storage and use derby as MetaStorage.\r\n3. Run single IT test ITNestedQueryPushDownTest which includes data ingestion, Historical loading and query action.\r\n\r\nNow job `71` is successful which means this PR is not WIP anymore!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

I found the README revolving around the IT suite somewhat confusing when it comes to running the Hadoop Tasks. When to build the image, when to run the image, etc. all seemed a little bit more confusing than it needed to be. Because of that experience, I made some small tweaks that I think will help devs run integration tests using the local hadoop container.\r\n\r\nI created a new argument to pass to maven commands that is dedicated to building the Hadoop Container. I added some context in a few different places that helps guide devs towards how to run the tests in different situations (run tests when containers already running? run tests when images built but containers not running? run tests when you need to build and run containers, etc.)\r\n\r\nI hope this is found useful by others.

Description\r\n\r\n#10219 added `hasNulls` to `ColumnCapabilities`, allowing things to know if a column has any null values in SQL compatible mode (`druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`). With this information available, `NullableNumericAggregatorFactory` can be modified to use a version of the null-aware wrapper aggregators which do not need to check `isNull` on each aggregate call, which should reduce the overhead of enabling this mode for columns which do not have null values (I haven't actually measured this yet so I'm unsure of the difference).\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I have pulled out most of the logic of `NullableNumericAggregator`, `NullableNumericBufferAggregator`, and `NullableNumericVectorAggregator` into a new set of abstract classes, `NullAwareNumericAggregator`, `NullAwareNumericVectorAggregator`, and `NullAwareNumericVectorAggregator` respectively which the former now extend. For processing columns which do not have null values, a new set of 'non-null' aggregator wrappers have been introduced, `NonnullNumericAggregator`, `NonnullNumericBufferAggregator`, and `NonnullNumericVectorAggregator`, which also extend the 'null-aware' base classes, so that they initialize to a null value and are compatible with the expectations of aggregator behavior with filtering (which reasonably expect an aggregator 'get' to produce the correct result, even if no values were aggregated), but can skip the 'is null check'.\r\n\r\n`NullableNumericAggregatorFactory` (which should probably more correctly be renamed `NullAwareNumericAggregatorFactory` but its marked `@ExtensionPoint` so I tried not to mess with it too much), has also been expanded to include a new method to check if the aggregator input has null values, with a default implementation of:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Returns true if the aggregator will actually produce null values given its input selectors, e.g. if\r\n   * the inputs to the aggregator have any nulls.\r\n   */\r\n  protected boolean hasNulls(ColumnInspector inspector)\r\n  {\r\n    return sqlCompatible;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith implementations that override in the 'simple' aggregator factories. Since there was a lot of duplicated code between the 'simple' aggregator factories (`SimpleLongAggregatorFactory`, `SimpleFloatAggregatorFactory`, `SimpleDoubleAggregatorFactory`), I have introduced yet another base class, `SimpleNumericAggregatorFactory` to consolidate all of the 'fieldName'/'expression' handling stuff.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic abstract class SimpleNumericAggregatorFactory<TValueSelector extends BaseNullableColumnValueSelector>\r\n    extends NullableNumericAggregatorFactory<ColumnValueSelector>\r\n```\r\nwhich also handles the 'hasNulls' check override of `NullableNumericAggregatorFactory`. This class could probably be consolidated with `NullableNumericAggregatorFactory`, but since that class is `@ExtensionPoint`, I avoided making this change at this time.\r\n\r\nI'll try to find some time to measure the difference, but naively it seems obvious that using the 'non-null' family of aggregators should be better due to having fewer method calls and branching opportunities.\r\n\r\nThere is a potential further optimization that callers which \"know\" that there are values to aggregate (e.g. no filter) could avoid the extra byte of overhead used for null tracking for columns which don't have any null values by modifying the 'factorize' methods to let callers communicate this information (aggregators don't know such things), but I haven't made this modification at this time since this PR was already starting to get a bit big, so can be done as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where tables with all of their segments dropped could still incorrectly show up in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables when queries with SQL. The underlying issue was caused by a race condition between `DruidSchema.tables` being populated upon rebuilding the tables, segment removal handlers removing segments from `tables` when no other segments were left (but not `dataSourcesNeedingRebuild`), and `DruidSchema.dataSourcesNeedingRebuild` not considering if the table had been removed from `tables` due to all the segments being dropped in the time between being added to the refresh list and actually doing the refresh.\r\n\r\nThe added an additional step to the `ITBroadcastJoinQueryTest` integration test that would fail prior to the changes in `DruidSchema`, and chose this test in particular to cover the most surface area since there are segments on both the historical and the broker.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
