`ClusterCommunicationsDUnitTest` to assign the locator port in\nthe test JVM and to not start the HTTP service.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI am working on a project to allow Geode tests to run in parallel\noutside of Docker. Running in parallel outside of Docker requires tests:\n- To assign ports only in the test JVM, to ensure that ports are\n  assigned only by the latest implementation of `AvailablePortHelper`,\n  which knows how to allocate a unique range of ports to each test.\n- Not to start services using default ports, to ensure that no two tests\n  try to use a default port at the same time.\n\nThis commit prepares for those changes.\n\nPROBLEMS\n\n`ClusterCommunicationsDUnitTest` inhibits running in parallel outside of\nDocker in two ways:\n\n- It calls `createLocator()` in child VMs running prior versions of\n  Geode. The method assigns a locator port by calling\n  `AvailablePortHelper`. The old implementation of `AvailablePortHelper`\n  in the child VM might assign a port that is \"reserved\" by another\n  test, resulting in bind failures.\n- `createLocator()` tacitly starts the HTTP service on the default port\n  (7070). If multiple tests attempt to bind to this port, some will\n  experience bind failures.\n\nTHIS COMMIT\n\nChange `ClusterCommunicationsDUnitTest` to:\n\n- Assign the locator port in the test JVM.\n- Disable the HTTP service, which the test does not

guide\".","created_at":"2021-05-27T11:23:37Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T07:49:52Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T07:49:47Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T07:49:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a3e2cb6c302b02fceeb57e09b3c6cf41a7fbcf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/53571038c8e27d91fa5a35efea7b7534697c48ad","head":{"label":"Nordix:feature/GEODE-9042","ref":"feature/GEODE-9042","sha":"53571038c8e27d91fa5a35efea7b7534697c48ad","user":{"login":"Nordix","id":36034376,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MDM0Mzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36034376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix","html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":180747280,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA3NDcyODA=","name":"geode","full_name":"Nordix/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Nordix","id":36034376,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MDM0Mzc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36034376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix","html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nordix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Nordix/geode","description":"Apache

`WANRollingUpgradeDUnitTest` and\n`WANRollingUpgradeCreateSenderGatewaySenderMixedSiteOneCurrentSiteTwo`\nto assign ports only in the test JVM.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs part of my project to allow Geode tests to run in parallel outside of\nDocker, I am changing our build system to allocate a distinct range of\nports to each test JVM, and changing `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper` to honor these allocated port ranges.\n\nThis commit prepares for those changes.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n- `WANRollingUpgradeCreateSenderGatewaySenderMixedSiteOneCurrentSiteTwo`\n  calls `startLocatorWithJmxManager()` in a child VM running a prior\n  version of Geode. This method then calls `AvailablePortHelper` to get\n  a JMX manager port.\n- `WANRollingUpgradeDUnitTest` calls `addCacheServer()` in a child VM\n  running a prior version of Geode. This method them calls\n  `AvailablePortHelper` to get a server port.\n- In each case, the old implementation of `AvailablePortHelper` in the\n  child VM does not honor the range of ports allocated to the test.\n- If these tests run in parallel outside of Docker, the old\n  implementations of `AvailablePortHelper` may assign the same port\n  number in each test.  If different tests try to bind to the same port\n  at the same time, all but one will fail.\n\nGENERAL SOLUTION\n\nMake tests assign ports only in the test JVM. The test JVM always\nincludes the latest implementations of `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper`, and so the tests  will honor any port allocation\nscheme defined in the latest implementation.\n\nTHIS COMMIT\n\n- Change `startLocatorWithJmxManager()` and `addCacheServer()` to be\n  factory functions that take the relevant port as a parameter and\n  return a `SerializableRunnable` that serializes the port and can be\n  invoked in the child VM.\n- Change each test to assign the relevant port in the test JVM, call the\n  relevant factory method to get a runnable, and execute the runnable in\n  the child VM.\n\nIn this way, all ports are assigned in the test JVM, which includes the\nlatest implementation of `AvailablePortHelper`, which will (after my\neventual enhancement) honor the port ranges allocated to the test JVM\nand ensure that no two tests try to bind to the same port.\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T20:08:03Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T19:00:05Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T19:00:00Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T19:00:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"168bf86ebc8e0ef9df9be06143669bfe97654ab6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"alb3rtobr","id":5363407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr","html_url":"https://github.com/alb3rtobr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"boglesby","id":1002028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby","html_url":"https://github.com/boglesby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/be5d347f7385da79848d062d31d7747be7624d62","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:geode-8772/wan-rolling-upgrade","ref":"geode-8772/wan-rolling-upgrade","sha":"be5d347f7385da79848d062d31d7747be7624d62","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"http

`ClientServerMiscDUnitTestBase`, `ClientServerMiscDUnitTest`, and\n`ClientServerMiscBCDUnitTest` to assign ports only in the test JVM.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs part of my project to allow Geode tests to run in parallel outside of\nDocker, I am changing our build system to allocate a distinct range of\nports to each test JVM, and changing `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper` to honor these allocated port ranges.\n\nThis commit prepares for those changes.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nTo test compatibility, `ClientServerMiscDUnitTestBase` executes\n`createServerCache()` in a child VMs running old versions of Geode. The\n`createServerCache()` method assigns a server port via\n`AvailablePortHelper`.  The old implementation of `AvailablePortHelper`\nin the child VM does not honor the range of ports allocated to the child\nVM.\n\nIf such tests run in parallel outside of Docker, the\n`createServerCache()` method in each test may assign the same port. If\nthe servers in multiple tests attempt to bind to that port at the same\ntime, all but one server will fail.\n\nGENERAL SOLUTION\n\nMake tests assign ports only in the test JVM. The test JVM always\nincludes the latest implementations of `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper`, and so the tests  will honor any port allocation\nscheme defined in the latest

`ClientServerMiscDUnitTestBase` and `ClientServerMiscBCDUnitTest`\nto assign ports only in the test JVM.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs part of my project to allow Geode tests to run in parallel outside of\nDocker, I am changing our build system to allocate a distinct range of\nports to each test JVM, and changing `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper` to honor these allocated port ranges.\n\nThis commit prepares for those changes.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nTo test compatibility, `ClientServerMiscDUnitTestBase` executes\n`createServerCache()` in a child VMs running old versions of Geode. The\n`createServerCache()` method assigns a server port via\n`AvailablePortHelper`.  The old implementation of `AvailablePortHelper`\nin the child VM does not honor the range of ports allocated to the child\nVM.\n\nIf such tests run in parallel outside of Docker, the\n`createServerCache()` method in each test may assign the same port. If\nthe servers in multiple tests attempt to bind to that port at the same\ntime, all but one server will fail.\n\nGENERAL SOLUTION\n\nMake tests assign ports only in the test JVM. The test JVM always\nincludes the latest implementations of `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper`, and so the tests  will honor any port allocation\nscheme defined in the latest

notice that the JavaCompiler constructor calls the deprecated Files.createTempDir().

Looking at the deprecated method and the recommended substitute the latter might have less of a chance of collision due to its use of random suffixes (versus the former's monotonically-increasing ints).\r\n\r\nI run the test on ubuntu but the problem did not reproduce either after 1000 runs.\r\n\r\nI have implemented the change suggested in the ticket to avoid using the deprecated `Files.createTempDir()`.

ticket states that when a locator joins the cluster, it is notified about itself joining the system.\r\nThat problem was already solved by GEODE-6977, in `locatorJoined(...)` method of `LocatorMembershipListenerImpl` class, before starting the thread that will send the notifications about the new locator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // Remove locators that don't need to be notified (myself, the joining one and the one that\r\n    // notified myself).\r\n    List<DistributionLocatorId> ignoreList = Arrays.asList(locator, localLocatorId, sourceLocator);\r\n    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Set<DistributionLocatorId>> entry : localCopy.entrySet()) {\r\n      for (DistributionLocatorId removeLocId : ignoreList) {\r\n        entry.getValue().remove(removeLocId);\r\n      }\r\n
