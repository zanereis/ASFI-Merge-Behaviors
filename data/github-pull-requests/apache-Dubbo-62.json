change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-07T13:35:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T10:55:43Z","closed_at":"2019-04-07T14:09:31Z","merged_at":"2019-04-07T14:09:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb5d96de60716a0ea7fbd5eb41731b4d67e3a803","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a29d909aada347b4d8b68e2b0a824b992c115a01","head":{"label":"chenlushun:master","ref":"master","sha":"a29d909aada347b4d8b68e2b0a824b992c115a01","user":{"login":"chenlushun","id":15846647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ2NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15846647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun","html_url":"https://github.com/chenlushun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6feaf5787f91d5d0b44eb0a69954a3bf6a71ee03","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/st

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-07T04:06:34Z","updated_at":"2019-04-07T09:56:04Z","closed_at":"2019-04-07T09:56:04Z","merged_at":"2019-04-07T09:56:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"2be39f0484f95003130612fc08a6e11618975dfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/776e5e2de02e6d89ff9db68c9b59aa7bee017993","head":{"label":"chenlushun:master","ref":"master","sha":"776e5e2de02e6d89ff9db68c9b59aa7bee017993","user":{"login":"chenlushun","id":15846647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQ2NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15846647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun","html_url":"https://github.com/chenlushun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenlushun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"844534959833f5ca1653cbe0f9ab81dc576cec01","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the process of using Dubbo, there are many scenarios where the Provider needs to know the applicationName of the Consumer (not just the Consumer IP). For example, I want to output the upstream caller to the log file and want to limit the flow according to the upstream application. Or downgrade, want to use the upstream application for arson drills, etc., so we usually add Filter to achieve (for example, DubboAppContextFilter in Sentinel, which is specifically done on the Consumer side: https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/ Blob/6bb4ff21dadde00c9453a5f57d030d55f87b71a8/sentinel-adapter/sentinel-dubbo-adapter/src/main/java/com/alibaba/csp/sentinel/adapter/dubbo/DubboAppContextFilter.java), so I also hope that Dubbo can put this inside Simple things have been done\r\n\r\n在我们使用Dubbo的过程中，有很多场景Provider端需要知道Consumer端的applicationName（而不仅仅只需要知道Consumer的IP），比如我想将上游调用方输出到出入口日志中、想根据上游应用来限流或降级、想根据上游应用来进行放火演练等，所以我们通常会自己加Filter来实现（例如Sentinel中的DubboAppContextFilter，就是专门在Consumer端做这个事情：https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/blob/6bb4ff21dadde00c9453a5f57d030d55f87b71a8/sentinel-adapter/sentinel-dubbo-adapter/src/main/java/com/alibaba/csp/sentinel/adapter/dubbo/DubboAppContextFilter.java），\r\n\r\n所以，我也特别希望Dubbo内部能把这块简单的事情给做了\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-06T10:01:50Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T10:51:34Z","closed_at":"2019-04-10T03:18:34Z","merged_at":"2019-04-10T03:18:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"b70b3eac9ec3323b64ac9596982a09affc01989d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2eb5bc08e4229b410cc02b42cd25528eb17d80ff","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:applicationname","ref":"applicationname","sha":"2eb5bc08e4229b410cc02b42cd25528eb17d80ff","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #3804 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nUpdate nacos client to 1.0.0-RC3\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun `mvn license:add-third-party -Dlicense.useMissingFile` and make sure the following dependency is gone.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.codehaus.jackson</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>jackson-mapper-lgpl</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-05T12:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T06:38:15Z","closed_at":"2019-04-08T06:35:08Z","merged_at":"2019-04-08T06:35:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e5af753e4c4ab9adcf4e452c765207c3165d74e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e0e42e2aaeedf4549734bdd2cc456db4ff6d9b96","head":{"label":"ralf0131:upgrade-nacos-version","ref":"upgrade-nacos-version","sha":"e0e42e2aaeedf4549734bdd2cc456db4ff6d9b96","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nrename ClassHelper to ClassUtils\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. add ClassUtils to replace ClassHelper , ClassHelper add deprecated annotation.\r\n2. add MethodUtils,  move isSetter/isGetter into it.\r\n\r\nNext step : \r\nMerging \r\norg.apache.dubbo.common.compiler.support.ClassUtils,\r\norg.apache.dubbo.config.spring.util.ClassUtils,\r\norg.apache.dubbo.metadata.definition.util.ClassUtils,\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nUT\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-04T08:00:57Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T06:57:20Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T06:57:20Z","merged_at":"2019-04-30T06:57:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e18904832791e878e7e3362a1d7280a7c0481f0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/65a9227f379f2278192b4c2d141a958d287dde55","head":{"label":"LiZhenNet:refactor","ref":"refactor","sha":"65a9227f379f2278192b4c2d141a958d287dde55","user":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158160981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgxNjA5ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo enable dubbo to supply Reactive Programming api(Mono/Flux)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd AbstractReactiveProxyFactory combined with AbstractReactiveProxyInvoker and ReactiveInvokerInvocationHandler to supply reactive programming ability for provider and consumer side.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-01T07:15:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T03:09:21Z","closed_at":"2019-04-02T03:09:21Z","merged_at":"2019-04-02T03:09:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"4785a27fb4f1e662b793aea08abbb5f974ec8d00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4486cc3e149f29eaec5ae0e947ebb0a60c29a80d","head":{"label":"wanghbxxxx:2.6.x_addASFheader","ref":"2.6.x_addASFheader","sha":"4486cc3e149f29eaec5ae0e947ebb0a60c29a80d","user":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168285473,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjgyODU0NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wanghbxxxx","id":6959062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTkwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghbxxxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wanghbxxxx/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-01T06:08:11Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T06:21:42Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T06:21:42Z","merged_at":"2019-04-01T06:21:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"1df4a21d315421f0f9f101a6bfd6ab8811853e74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/764aada2054bd3309f4e5f6a42f93be1974a6d1e","head":{"label":"ralf0131:add-build-instructions","ref":"add-build-instructions","sha":"764aada2054bd3309f4e5f6a42f93be1974a6d1e","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-29T20:39:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T03:11:06Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T03:11:06Z","merged_at":"2019-05-14T03:11:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ca5a10c43196dbb87211022f274ce5590685fe9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/14d77b7b97d8c7bc7bab8d5c11a71437f7ff1eff","head":{"label":"danielamorais:feature/merge-dubbo-rpc-xmlrpc","ref":"feature/merge-dubbo-rpc-xmlrpc","sha":"14d77b7b97d8c7bc7bab8d5c11a71437f7ff1eff","user":{"login":"danielamorais","id":8279779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8279779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais","html_url":"https://github.com/danielamorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178013977,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzgwMTM5Nzc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"danielamorais/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"danielamorais","id":8279779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8279779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais","html_url":"https://github.com/danielamorais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielamorais/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/danielamorais/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-29T05:05:10Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T11:12:55Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T04:40:49Z","merged_at":"2019-04-01T04:40:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b145c75880b25343b67a0ae242f27322db9ba18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/aadfdda983bbd91dc5efe55bc3a26dc3784a67ea","head":{"label":"cyejing:fix-fastjson","ref":"fix-fastjson","sha":"aadfdda983bbd91dc5efe55bc3a26dc3784a67ea","user":{"login":"cyejing","id":6317049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTcwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6317049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing","html_url":"https://github.com/cyejing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyejing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fca31c45f47da0dbc1cf0a85ad5d87b2384a5c36","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscr

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-28T07:06:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T09:27:42Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T03:41:56Z","merged_at":"2019-04-01T03:41:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"90ffbc2dddba5893a3dd84e38936cb92d2d1f7fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2028757bc68d596dc896fa39e79047349a9b6c0d","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:removeDependency","ref":"removeDependency","sha":"2028757bc68d596dc896fa39e79047349a9b6c0d","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-27T10:05:25Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T15:18:02Z","closed_at":"2019-03-27T15:18:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nresolve #3746 \r\n\r\nWhen `IOException` is thrown in `org.apache.dubbo.registry.support.AbstractRegistry#doSaveProperties`, which is usually unrecoverable (permission denied, path not exists or no free disk space) it will retry infinitely, this patch tries to resolve this issue by stop retrying when `IOException` occurs.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\norg.apache.dubbo.registry.support.AbstractRegistry\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T17:03:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T02:02:13Z","closed_at":"2019-03-27T02:01:59Z","merged_at":"2019-03-27T02:01:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"c11df9363e9ebe76feee9b7ccfc40ddd61d9bd1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f52869f9ccd78f33398b56db1c5ea7f77c3c0d32","head":{"label":"mawenlong1:dubbo-fs","ref":"dubbo-fs","sha":"f52869f9ccd78f33398b56db1c5ea7f77c3c0d32","user":{"login":"mawenlong1","id":26384313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Mzg0MzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26384313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1","html_url":"https://github.com/mawenlong1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177804372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzc4MDQzNzI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"mawenlong1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mawenlong1","id":26384313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Mzg0MzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26384313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1","html_url":"https://github.com/mawenlong1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mawenlong1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mawenlong1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-25T17:15:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T01:09:12Z","closed_at":"2019-03-26T01:09:12Z","merged_at":"2019-03-26T01:09:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad72159b0e3ff641e3a08754297c81278b94d94e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2976f387a69c8cfcc139756184700258cc9f6df0","head":{"label":"John-Smile:dev_fix_magic_number","ref":"dev_fix_magic_number","sha":"2976f387a69c8cfcc139756184700258cc9f6df0","user":{"login":"John-Smile","id":9248612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9248612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile","html_url":"https://github.com/John-Smile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174839070,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQ4MzkwNzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"John-Smile/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"John-Smile","id":9248612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9248612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile","html_url":"https://github.com/John-Smile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/John-Smile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/John-Smile/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSync changes between these two branches.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nmerge and resolve conflicts\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo commits lost.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-22T03:09:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T09:25:36Z","closed_at":"2019-04-09T06:11:14Z","merged_at":"2019-04-09T06:11:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"a378a019949d5989e3e8a54e0e02b8a9f68745be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/371fc6cd763e8c619f3e9c7df3af1278814a9ff4","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:mergeAvro","ref":"mergeAvro","sha":"371fc6cd763e8c619f3e9c7df3af1278814a9ff4","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-22T02:58:32Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T09:41:54Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T09:41:54Z","merged_at":"2019-04-29T09:41:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"72fe93bf22c1f7db88b5d083c9570b27e1032542","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/264ac9f819c4c54fa1d0820d754095fea469ab5a","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue-3713","ref":"issue-3713","sha":"264ac9f819c4c54fa1d0820d754095fea469ab5a","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6e4ff91dfca4395a8d1b180f40f632e97acf779d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-21T05:25:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T06:19:04Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T06:19:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09dc10364c2448b35b58574921732d912db11f6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fd40cf3dba8ca7e5c0231e1caa740ae44dce917f","head":{"label":"kexianjun:2.6.x-fix-3695","ref":"2.6.x-fix-3695","sha":"fd40cf3dba8ca7e5c0231e1caa740ae44dce917f","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nrun unit test\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-20T02:12:45Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T02:37:02Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T02:37:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b9bf4a265651abf24837e080cc21b63bc9f7394e","head":{"label":"apache:3.x-dev","ref":"3.x-dev","sha":"b9bf4a265651abf24837e080cc21b63bc9f7394e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-19T09:23:43Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T11:32:47Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T11:32:47Z","merged_at":"2019-03-19T11:32:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"32d59f7f22b0e61617c7e49dde3b6aa5ba41523b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b53ed6601d1dfb1648a130aa1b14f55ee0ba1e0d","head":{"label":"ralf0131:improve-etcd-lease-id-check","ref":"improve-etcd-lease-id-check","sha":"b53ed6601d1dfb1648a130aa1b14f55ee0ba1e0d","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-18T17:31:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T10:02:44Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T10:02:44Z","merged_at":"2019-03-20T10:02:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad5f9f909e6282381499e63070c6175014c81935","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/95638e7225b170a1bb9cf34a471f0c94453fd097","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:config-center-config","ref":"config-center-config","sha":"95638e7225b170a1bb9cf34a471f0c94453fd097","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-18T01:51:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T09:53:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-18T14:28:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bc8589ecc7e2a20cee185f38536a1843cf2b600","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bc67770d64f69c87de7f8b0be3e7f44bd28487e7","head":{"label":"apache:2.7.1-release","ref":"2.7.1-release","sha":"bc67770d64f69c87de7f8b0be3e7f44bd28487e7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-17T03:26:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T14:11:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T12:04:16Z","merged_at":"2019-03-20T12:04:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"da69a9c8db15b6047cb80ed3d2251215784dcb0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/affc976120356c93a44f98f612184c06e8ddf09f","head":{"label":"kexianjun:fix-3678","ref":"fix-3678","sha":"affc976120356c93a44f98f612184c06e8ddf09f","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

[x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-15T07:31:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T07:44:52Z","closed_at":"2019-03-15T07:44:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34d216f5d8c7c17001478a01a23c213e3e4e0c21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/41a89586cc8fa463c7f2e63bab2ef5c315c23a7f","head":{"label":"apache:2.7.1-release","ref":"2.7.1-release","sha":"41a89586cc8fa463c7f2e63bab2ef5c315c23a7f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-15T06:20:30Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T07:58:37Z","closed_at":"2019-03-15T07:58:37Z","merged_at":"2019-03-15T07:58:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"868f02dde2868d8944ee7ecafb73bc1f88cbf6d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cda93dd3267c0fd5ee37b232264ef16d1542f61c","head":{"label":"beiwei30:consul-change-event","ref":"consul-change-event","sha":"cda93dd3267c0fd5ee37b232264ef16d1542f61c","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.7.1-release","ref":"2.7.1-release","sha":"1d6845c0fbb582461ce98e78875f31264156a468","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-15T02:23:28Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T06:56:39Z","closed_at":"2019-03-15T06:56:39Z","merged_at":"2019-03-15T06:56:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e6cbbe56820206b5d6a54eff8fdaaedab335840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/89a6c4d4cb443e9021873b66453921c8ada2b9f6","head":{"label":"chickenlj:check-null-for-path","ref":"check-null-for-path","sha":"89a6c4d4cb443e9021873b66453921c8ada2b9f6","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

`DubboMonitorTest.testCount()` many times\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T09:13:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:42:39Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:42:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f93795e8a2b598dc87d92d239a34e81e87211bf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T07:54:08Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T14:57:52Z","closed_at":"2019-03-18T14:33:59Z","merged_at":"2019-03-18T14:33:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"79f0b7cc1f64ec88dd8e3db78ba9d37e7e4f1bc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9786a45553f8969dc12cddb55c536d088534bcfa","head":{"label":"kezhenxu94:polish","ref":"polish","sha":"9786a45553f8969dc12cddb55c536d088534bcfa","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b2bfbc76d13106a3211f5af1713ba50848560060","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://

Fix  when change rate value， it is not effective.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUT\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T07:35:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T14:15:04Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T14:15:04Z","merged_at":"2019-03-19T14:15:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"660624ce9ad3ef1ca95fc3b6a88bf7b94dfa7628","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3654/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3654/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3654/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c3f2f197681b450c35e89bcd70f0bda0cc1df0c5","head":{"label":"LiZhenNet:longadder","ref":"longadder","sha":"c3f2f197681b450c35e89bcd70f0bda0cc1df0c5","user":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158160981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgxNjA5ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LiZhenNet","id":9859779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTk3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9859779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet","html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiZhenNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LiZhenNet/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #3629 \r\n\r\nFirst, the existing implementation by using two variables for controlling `ServiceConfig` exporting state is not only awkward to code, but also can theoretically lead invalid state transitions (`exported` and `unexported` both simultaneously true).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the `exported` is set in `doExport()` method which could be called asynchronously, this makes it hard to refactor to prevent duplication exporting. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nthe following changes are introduced:\r\n\r\n1. refactor the two variables `exported` and `unexported` into one `AtomicInteger` variable `exportingStage`.\r\n2. `compare and set` exporting state in `export()` and `unexport()` methods **before doing anything**.\r\n3. remove the `synchronized` from the two methods.\r\n4. add unit-test for this fix to verify everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existing exporting state transition flow is as follows, remains unchanged after this PR :\r\n```\r\n        +----------------+\r\n        | INITIAL_STAGE  |\r\n        +----------------+\r\n              |     ^\r\n              |     |\r\n              V     |\r\n        +-----------------+\r\n        | EXPORTING_STAGE |\r\n        +-----------------+\r\n                 |\r\n                 |\r\n                 V\r\n        +-----------------+\r\n        | EXPORTED_STAGE |\r\n        +-----------------+\r\n                 |\r\n                 |\r\n                 V\r\n        +-----------------+\r\n        | UNEXPORTED_STAGE|\r\n        +-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNecessary unit-test is added, see `ServiceConfigTest`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T03:32:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:36:57Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:36:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6021d46777db4a09dd769aec46b79a6d05f4160a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T02:39:30Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T02:58:18Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T02:58:18Z","merged_at":"2019-03-14T02:58:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea3fbc822a813428367c44b6f4bdb0e51b8429b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2967a238d5226e222cdea65134a7cdded640fc49","head":{"label":"beiwei30:javadoc","ref":"javadoc","sha":"2967a238d5226e222cdea65134a7cdded640fc49","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"bf3b423dc5635511000fbd2dcae1b955fbd87d67","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-13T07:04:10Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T07:32:50Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T07:32:50Z","merged_at":"2019-03-14T07:32:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4bfb3d0e78ec903792f34cdd71017819584203b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6ad9df4a6d89649ab8d1eb2c6852b764081b78b1","head":{"label":"nzomkxia:master","ref":"master","sha":"6ad9df4a6d89649ab8d1eb2c6852b764081b78b1","user":{"login":"nzomkxia","id":1183397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1183397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia","html_url":"https://github.com/nzomkxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"bf3b423dc5635511000fbd2dcae1b955fbd87d67","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/own

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-13T02:48:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T01:39:13Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T01:39:13Z","merged_at":"2019-06-25T01:39:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffce958ee037bf49e13f7f6cfce9ee212e3f2a8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/24","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/24","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/24/labels","id":4098796,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDA5ODc5Ng==","number":24,"title":"2.6.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"nzomkxia","id":1183397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1183397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia","html_url":"https://github.com/nzomkxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzomkxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":16,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-01T03:44:34Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T09:37:49Z","due_on":"2019-07-10T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-07-09T02:43:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/21e3e7c0cb6b05fa8d7f96d2b30f815625a97003","head":{"label":"cvictory:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"21e3e7c0cb6b05fa8d7f96d2b30f815625a97003","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-12T10:41:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T14:27:27Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T08:27:12Z","merged_at":"2019-03-14T08:27:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"08d5f15a4cb5ea014eb817b1b1106c8fae449998","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/324d37270455f14cfda058c80ffc4b542294d45b","head":{"label":"cvictory:issue_2045","ref":"issue_2045","sha":"324d37270455f14cfda058c80ffc4b542294d45b","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #619 , and PR #2956 is not enough in the following use case:\r\n\r\nIn souche.com, we add 'trace' function in dubbo, such as in FailoverClusterInvoker.doInvoke, we get stackTrace from exception to log detail exception info using the following:\r\n\r\n`org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace(result.getException())`\r\n\r\nThe above sentence will result the same problem with issue #619 .\r\n\r\nSo, we should solve this in decode stage.\r\n\r\n#619 这个问题, PR #2956 貌似已经解决了, 但是我们公司(souche.com)在对dubbo加全链路埋点时, 还是遇到了之前的问题, 因为 #2956 是在InvokerInvocationHandler.invoke()方法的invoker.invoke(invocation)后解决了问题, 但是我们在FailoverClusterInvoker.doInvoke()方法里坐全链路埋点时, 为了能取到异常栈的信息, 用了如下的语句:\r\n`org.apache.commons.lang3.exception.ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace(result.getException())`\r\n导致了异常栈又出问题了..\r\n\r\n所以应该在decode后, 对exception对象做判断才对.\r\n\r\n## Brief

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-11T08:09:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T11:12:46Z","closed_at":"2019-04-02T06:37:55Z","merged_at":"2019-04-02T06:37:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"f932d7b453d925b7d29c35130debf41707e77957","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/13e1ce4e853b0d5ac8dea75153ace03fc5bc134d","head":{"label":"maoyiz:fix#619","ref":"fix#619","sha":"13e1ce4e853b0d5ac8dea75153ace03fc5bc134d","user":{"login":"maoyiz","id":11908486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz","html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138553275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg1NTMyNzU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"maoyiz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maoyiz","id":11908486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz","html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\ntypo for AccessLogFilter\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-11T06:56:11Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T13:54:50Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T07:03:03Z","merged_at":"2019-03-11T07:03:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f19335477a9ea4eb0af0dd0bdbe068b4e309edd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2362edf002af66274c5ac31d8ca3170f81ab3756","head":{"label":"Bricks-Man:typo","ref":"typo","sha":"2362edf002af66274c5ac31d8ca3170f81ab3756","user":{"login":"Bricks-Man","id":19564203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTY0MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19564203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man","html_url":"https://github.com/Bricks-Man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bricks-Man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c65b589fc2b5cebed0138386f8e62e3c2528691e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/u

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-11T06:48:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T14:43:35Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T14:29:16Z","merged_at":"2019-03-11T14:29:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"fed47bf0a864f0922c5086e3d10b37acec563f3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0bafe8309e7d4b1056d9f9679b4a44c1c3c22ef6","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:fix_etcd3_bugs","ref":"fix_etcd3_bugs","sha":"0bafe8309e7d4b1056d9f9679b4a44c1c3c22ef6","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang/dubbo","description":"Open

What is the purpose of the change\r\nadd socks5 proxy support for dubbo-remoting-netty4.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nCheck the system property 'socks5ProxyHost' in org.apache.dubbo.remoting.transport.netty4.NettyClient#initChannel, if it exists, use the system property socks5ProxyHost and socks5ProxyPort to create a Socks5ProxyHandler and add it to the first location of the ChannelPipeline\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2019-03-09T03:07:43Z","updated_at":"2019-04-28T01:35:19Z","closed_at":"2019-04-26T03:00:56Z","merged_at":"2019-04-26T03:00:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"083605ad06dbccc7d833ff7dc84a62b736df44b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0fca65d0ae75b31f950626d8e0ce95310a30506e","head":{"label":"nihongye:featureSocks5Support","ref":"featureSocks5Support","sha":"0fca65d0ae75b31f950626d8e0ce95310a30506e","user":{"login":"nihongye","id":3047058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDcwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye","html_url":"https://github.com/nihongye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174338492,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMzg0OTI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"nihongye/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nihongye","id":3047058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDcwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye","html_url":"https://github.com/nihongye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nihongye/starred{/owner}{/repo}"

changelog\r\n\r\nInvoker in Compatible module.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-08T07:30:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T14:42:57Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T14:42:41Z","merged_at":"2019-03-11T14:42:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f193b995290824632814c8bb54ca74b2c34a3d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3622/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3622/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3622/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2edb9be5f5a8abebfa22e29cc5d92202b0756cdd","head":{"label":"chickenlj:package-compatible-#3570","ref":"package-compatible-#3570","sha":"2edb9be5f5a8abebfa22e29cc5d92202b0756cdd","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-07T09:04:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T02:21:35Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T02:21:17Z","merged_at":"2019-03-08T02:21:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8b28cf33652387887c12474ad3881134b7e7f79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/56d48b92e59be8373ac3d8c2dc8097a529d4947a","head":{"label":"beiwei30:followup-issue-195","ref":"followup-issue-195","sha":"56d48b92e59be8373ac3d8c2dc8097a529d4947a","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fe049b8ddd29cd4539d9603bdc680f1e43a7d784","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request add the support for etcd as registry. #808 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. merge code from https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-registry-etcd into incubator-dubbo.\r\n2. Update all the unit test from Junit 4 to Junit 5\r\n3. Remove all the author info\r\n4. Fix some typo\r\n\r\nNote that unit tests are disabled by default, because there is no embedded etcd server. If you would like to run the unit test, you need to start an etcd server locally.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWrite a demo application and verified provider and consumer could work with etcd as reigstry.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the
