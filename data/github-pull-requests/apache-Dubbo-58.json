Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-22T10:07:39Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T02:49:38Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:39:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c85f93f4b9f45d9ab0fc4089e7a242908c8ed4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

changelog\r\n\r\n1.  add merger field in `@Reference`  and `@Method` \r\n2.  add unit test in `ReferenceConfigTest.java` and  `MethodConfigJava` to test  getter, setter and construct from annotation\r\n3.  add unit test in `AnnotationPropertyValuesAdapterTest.java`  check databind for merger\r\n4.  add unit test in `ReferenceBeanBuilderTest.java` to verify  referencebean will contain merger info\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nunit test :\r\n\r\n- ReferenceConfigTest.java\r\n- MethodConfigJavaTest.java\r\n- AnnotationPropertyValuesAdapterTest.java\r\n-

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-20T15:36:55Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T13:18:38Z","closed_at":"2019-07-23T13:18:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffb97466175ae6ea2adbfa9d7a813072948e8fe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ef64d5e86e288d13d07c4b3f600ac4f420152f8f","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:log_optimize","ref":"log_optimize","sha":"ef64d5e86e288d13d07c4b3f600ac4f420152f8f","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-20T08:46:57Z","updated_at":"2019-07-20T08:47:04Z","closed_at":"2019-07-20T08:47:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d7ce0c94cb3a4d8942c6b38dc8790260db6c894","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ba833d3444c0846047e4f67c7f13a553a3abdec0","head":{"label":"hadesvip:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"ba833d3444c0846047e4f67c7f13a553a3abdec0","user":{"login":"hadesvip","id":9640832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDA4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9640832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip","html_url":"https://github.com/hadesvip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadesvip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9960d231842806767a683f24ae5aafb58eeb5075","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-20T08:35:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T08:34:17Z","closed_at":"2019-07-22T08:34:17Z","merged_at":"2019-07-22T08:34:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"443b6ff49f5ee0670c10e559c8adb30ac6206bc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/150fa3685809a009b353ac724f9bed7900c1f63e","head":{"label":"finalcola:httpClientConcManager-fix","ref":"httpClientConcManager-fix","sha":"150fa3685809a009b353ac724f9bed7900c1f63e","user":{"login":"finalcola","id":27013879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDEzODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27013879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola","html_url":"https://github.com/finalcola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197714638,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTc3MTQ2Mzg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finalcola/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finalcola","id":27013879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDEzODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27013879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola","html_url":"https://github.com/finalcola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finalcola/dubbo","description":"Apache

version: 2.6.6\r\nOperating System version: *nix\r\nJava version: 1.7\r\nWhen we use complex arguments, in telnet mode , we need use jsonArray to parse.\r\nBut in our code ,someone try to resolve an overwrite problem ,so make an issue #257\r\nthen @beiwei30 try to fix this issue use this code below 27917f2\r\n\r\nThe code will make the default method not take effect.\r\n\r\nThe code before like this\r\n```java\r\n private static Method findMethod(Exporter<?> exporter, String method, List<Object> args) {\r\n        Invoker<?> invoker = exporter.getInvoker();\r\n        Method[] methods = invoker.getInterface().getMethods();\r\n        Method invokeMethod = null;\r\n        for (Method m : methods) {\r\n            if (m.getName().equals(method) && m.getParameterTypes().length == args.size()) {\r\n                if (invokeMethod != null) { // 重载\r\n                    if (isMatch(invokeMethod.getParameterTypes(), args)) {\r\n                        invokeMethod = m;\r\n                        break;\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    invokeMethod = m;\r\n                }\r\n                invoker = exporter.getInvoker();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return invokeMethod;\r\n```\r\nWe can have a default method with the the methodName and the same length arguments.\r\nBut after the code change , it must provides the correct arguments type. We should know\r\njson parse cannot give the corrent type. It maybe JsonObject or even HashMap.\r\nSo someone points out this problem #2766.\r\nIn my opinion ,we should not define the same name method. Such as retry or timeout , these configs may just take effect in method or service or provider .In these cases ,methodName can stands for method. That is to say ,a lot of configs just consider the method name .\r\nIn dubbo 2.7.x, for this issue ,dubbo provides a new telnet command called select.\r\nSo ,We should consider which is better.\r\n\r\nSee issue https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4565

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

initialized.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-18T06:15:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T06:55:53Z","closed_at":"2019-07-31T03:07:56Z","merged_at":"2019-07-31T03:07:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"c3132b8343de5ba8ce289822a633c32de79c2799","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27/labels","id":4418980,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDQxODk4MA==","number":27,"title":"2.7.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":100,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T13:07:08Z","due_on":"2019-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T05:43:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/65406346cecf433d5851f68143bcb28f6176c6d4","head":{"label":"Leishunyu:annotation-method-config","ref":"annotation-method-config","sha":"65406346cecf433d5851f68143bcb28f6176c6d4","user":{"login":"Leishunyu","id":29188508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTg4NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29188508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu","html_url":"https://github.com/Leishunyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197500889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTc1MDA4ODk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Leishunyu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Leishunyu","id":29188508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTg4NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29188508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu","html_url":"https://github.com/Leishunyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leishunyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Leishunyu/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-18T02:54:56Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T05:51:35Z","closed_at":"2020-02-05T04:29:39Z","merged_at":"2020-02-05T04:29:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"72eaf04c1ae61faf830898b565cc05c2f6478f3e","assignee":{"login":"hengyunabc","id":1683936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1683936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc","html_url":"https://github.com/hengyunabc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"hengyunabc","id":1683936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1683936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc","html_url":"https://github.com/hengyunabc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-17T09:30:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T03:42:22Z","closed_at":"2019-07-27T04:22:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40b11635f0c6f4f281828e2ceada73ce91ed0928","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4a039783851b414c90b800c05b070f630397c1a5","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue4248","ref":"issue4248","sha":"4a039783851b414c90b800c05b070f630397c1a5","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e496ca529945e25c7555a1d72a4cf08f54b41764","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4569\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-17T01:47:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T02:30:07Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T02:24:05Z","merged_at":"2019-07-17T02:24:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d663ad45b1eed609308d098a2cd616474eefaa7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/963e6811950bd3a06cf18d1266e75398e9ad0ef7","head":{"label":"zishinan:fix-4569","ref":"fix-4569","sha":"963e6811950bd3a06cf18d1266e75398e9ad0ef7","user":{"login":"zishinan","id":5515304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5515304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan","html_url":"https://github.com/zishinan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":191600749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE2MDA3NDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zishinan/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zishinan","id":5515304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTUzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5515304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan","html_url":"https://github.com/zishinan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zishinan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zishinan/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-15T06:00:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T06:00:31Z","closed_at":"2019-07-15T06:00:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/985a420eb44972d508a78d92c291d7e8d42be977","head":{"label":"beiwei30:disable-timeout-test","ref":"disable-timeout-test","sha":"985a420eb44972d508a78d92c291d7e8d42be977","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"05e44db43c829a7aea6cfc36ff522b981964f0ee","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-13T19:16:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T06:35:29Z","closed_at":"2019-07-15T05:58:01Z","merged_at":"2019-07-15T05:58:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"05e44db43c829a7aea6cfc36ff522b981964f0ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4566/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4566/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4566/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f03b98364c8bf225be58870468251fadf6a811b8","head":{"label":"lonre:fixaccesslog","ref":"fixaccesslog","sha":"f03b98364c8bf225be58870468251fadf6a811b8","user":{"login":"lonre","id":181109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre","html_url":"https://github.com/lonre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158160963,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgxNjA5NjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lonre/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lonre","id":181109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre","html_url":"https://github.com/lonre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lonre/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-11T05:30:11Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T03:02:58Z","closed_at":"2019-07-15T02:59:17Z","merged_at":"2019-07-15T02:59:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a88b1e295b63b27b194fea42d13f1720f3ba43a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27/labels","id":4418980,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDQxODk4MA==","number":27,"title":"2.7.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":100,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T13:07:08Z","due_on":"2019-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T05:43:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ea0dbd82bd66d49258e2d5dd967d686ffe8e3b25","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:VariableName","ref":"VariableName","sha":"ea0dbd82bd66d49258e2d5dd967d686ffe8e3b25","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-11T02:09:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T02:36:49Z","closed_at":"2019-07-12T02:06:01Z","merged_at":"2019-07-12T02:06:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"a5f60906665c2a7bf1ab4d9e2a18257bc17a0545","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

change\r\n\r\nadd unit tess in MethodUtilsTest\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-10T11:56:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:38:55Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:38:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"504fe856e6e2702e55f89fd091c8d4aa6edd28b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes #4514\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThis change fixes `Bytes.base642bytes(String, int, int, char[])` by adjusting `num` and `rem` variables when required, similar to `Bytes.base642bytes(String, int, int, String)`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA new test case was added in `BytesTest.java`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-09T13:24:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T03:45:31Z","closed_at":"2019-07-18T03:45:31Z","merged_at":"2019-07-18T03:45:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a50b2f7830ba720dfba0cb29a7660cfb4ffba23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1338af17c911477b160c842d3afd03bb336257c2","head":{"label":"vmgama:base642bytes-exception-fix","ref":"base642bytes-exception-fix","sha":"1338af17c911477b160c842d3afd03bb336257c2","user":{"login":"vmgama","id":51489417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDg5NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51489417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama","html_url":"https://github.com/vmgama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193227676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMyMjc2NzY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"vmgama/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vmgama","id":51489417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDg5NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51489417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama","html_url":"https://github.com/vmgama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmgama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vmgama/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-09T08:05:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T08:45:58Z","closed_at":"2019-07-16T08:45:20Z","merged_at":"2019-07-16T08:45:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"aab3a050cccdfdd0dad1ae3d3a73912a6838761c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27/labels","id":4418980,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDQxODk4MA==","number":27,"title":"2.7.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":100,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T13:07:08Z","due_on":"2019-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T05:43:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/62ea121e977db800fdf08ac814c5419ce4deffb4","head":{"label":"iwhalecloud-platform:issue4497","ref":"issue4497","sha":"62ea121e977db800fdf08ac814c5419ce4deffb4","user":{"login":"iwhalecloud-platform","id":51777477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzc3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51777477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform","html_url":"https://github.com/iwhalecloud-platform","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195948597,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU5NDg1OTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"iwhalecloud-platform/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iwhalecloud-platform","id":51777477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzc3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51777477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform","html_url":"https://github.com/iwhalecloud-platform","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwhalecloud-platform/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iwhalecloud-platform/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4499\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-09T07:30:32Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T08:31:19Z","closed_at":"2019-07-09T08:31:18Z","merged_at":"2019-07-09T08:31:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"0bd5a295295291e245ad9202362f25d4edcd6710","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0182e000fbefbfe299ce0235e3a1b7e33500a4dd","head":{"label":"chickenlj:rpccontext-future-compatibility","ref":"rpccontext-future-compatibility","sha":"0182e000fbefbfe299ce0235e3a1b7e33500a4dd","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-09T07:05:27Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T08:10:39Z","closed_at":"2019-07-09T08:03:42Z","merged_at":"2019-07-09T08:03:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"6e20848a72b068461ef10606ee6b8c4221cd696c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4502/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4502/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4502/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4a575c7c260f5509437e337dc159a5d025ca7561","head":{"label":"haiyang1985:alibaba_rpccontext","ref":"alibaba_rpccontext","sha":"4a575c7c260f5509437e337dc159a5d025ca7561","user":{"login":"haiyang1985","id":10457532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU3NTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10457532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985","html_url":"https://github.com/haiyang1985","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haiyang1985/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.7.3-release","ref":"2.7.3-release","sha":"3be09d76f3adbf4f4b5e96e0c709710204e18b80","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

OS\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ x ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ x ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ x ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ x ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-06T13:25:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-06T15:22:46Z","closed_at":"2019-07-06T15:22:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68f8a6afa35732f4e634cbe369db3d52a53e61c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f5432a889f86ca780d1d8e476bce8d0e47afda12","head":{"label":"sofkyle:master","ref":"master","sha":"f5432a889f86ca780d1d8e476bce8d0e47afda12","user":{"login":"sofkyle","id":7426860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjY4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7426860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle","html_url":"https://github.com/sofkyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"46215d20b785b8809a7a741203c5398e711675db","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-05T09:34:36Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T13:12:00Z","closed_at":"2019-07-05T13:12:00Z","merged_at":"2019-07-05T13:12:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"46215d20b785b8809a7a741203c5398e711675db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4480/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4480/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4480/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c872164bb95e568d4f6271ebe29b41d356cc5aef","head":{"label":"TingSky:master","ref":"master","sha":"c872164bb95e568d4f6271ebe29b41d356cc5aef","user":{"login":"TingSky","id":3785051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3785051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky","html_url":"https://github.com/TingSky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195376919,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTUzNzY5MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"TingSky/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TingSky","id":3785051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3785051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky","html_url":"https://github.com/TingSky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TingSky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TingSky/dubbo","description":"Apache

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-05T08:05:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T03:13:48Z","closed_at":"2019-07-09T03:13:48Z","merged_at":"2019-07-09T03:13:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"519df676329c87af23e285a448a94dc734b6094c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4476/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4476/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4476/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a6a1bbed4cdf7baae6d9fd57ef0d7ffe797532f1","head":{"label":"liuxx-u:master","ref":"master","sha":"a6a1bbed4cdf7baae6d9fd57ef0d7ffe797532f1","user":{"login":"liuxx-u","id":7148259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDgyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7148259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxx-u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117319482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTczMTk0ODI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liuxx-u/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuxx-u","id":7148259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDgyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7148259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxx-u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxx-u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuxx-u/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-05T02:17:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T09:57:07Z","closed_at":"2019-07-05T09:30:54Z","merged_at":"2019-07-05T09:30:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3e5460e4e2d7d26a4e2b66e280c668ecbfbc86d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-03T03:18:06Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T02:36:09Z","closed_at":"2019-07-05T09:57:16Z","merged_at":"2019-07-05T09:57:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a97d378964f5313f6c1e54895ee91e839a6e75b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f75a068a72a1428190a1a66cc2fa80a244542dea","head":{"label":"chickenlj:2.7.3-change-list","ref":"2.7.3-change-list","sha":"f75a068a72a1428190a1a66cc2fa80a244542dea","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

#4435 \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. Assume that service have sayHello and sayHi method. The sync timeout for sayHello is 1000, but not 800. We have to get method timeout for AsyncToSyncInvoke call. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<dubbo:reference id=\"demoService\" interface=\"com.ctrip.Demo\" timeout=\"1000\">\r\n  <dubbo:method name=\"sayHello\">\r\n    <dubbo:parameter key=\"timeout\" value=\"800\"/>\r\n  </dubbo:method>\r\n</dubbo:reference>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For the CompletableFuture, it will throw TimeoutException for negative timeout value.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-01T08:27:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T16:36:20Z","closed_at":"2019-07-02T06:21:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f9325699388f653ebbcd921cbdd0baf02d838715","head":{"label":"apache:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"f9325699388f653ebbcd921cbdd0baf02d838715","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
