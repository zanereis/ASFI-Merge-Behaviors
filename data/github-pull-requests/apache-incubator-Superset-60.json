a couple hundred warnings about hook dependencies. These are causing a terrible signal to noise ratio in lint runs, and we're unable to fix them for the most part due to larger systemic issues. For now, we should turn this off, to squelch the noise and more easily spot/fix the other issues eslint is reporting.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

pydruid(0.6.2) throws below exception on sqllab when a dataset have thetasketch. It needs to be upgraded to latest version. \r\n\r\nSince pydruid included to official docker image, `pip install pydruid` command aren't upgrading it(unless version number provided) although users may think latest version installed. That's why I think it is good idea to bump it. \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuperset_1        | 2022-09-27 07:19:05,869:ERROR:root:'complex<thetasketch>'\r\nsuperset_1        | Traceback (most recent call

href=\"https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/89b6dbb3c13d49ef1fa3d88888672d810853f05a\"><code>89b6dbb3</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Andarist\"><code>@​Andarist</code></a>! - Externalized code referencing <code>React.useInsertionEffect</code> to a separate <code>@emotion/use-insertion-effect-with-fallbacks</code> package. This package should be used in your defined externals if you bundle Emotion for whatever reason. It references <code>useInsertionEffect</code> in a very specific way that allows us to use it conditionally. However, if the code consuming Emotion is bundled as a library with Emotion in it then some bundlers might change the way in which we reference <code>useInsertionEffect</code> and that might create problems for bundlers used to consume the said library code. By externalizing this new package you can still bundle Emotion if you want to without running into this problem as you won't &quot;destroy&quot; the carefully crafted reference to <code>useInsertionEffect</code> in the process.</p>\n<p>Note that we don't recommend bundling Emotion.

href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases\">react-router-dom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>react-router-dom@6.4.0-pre.15</h2>\n<h3>Patch Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fix: remove internal router singleton (<a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9227\">#9227</a>)</p>\n<p>This change removes the internal module-level <code>routerSingleton</code> we create and maintain inside our data routers since it was causing a number of headaches for non-simple use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unit tests are a pain because you need to find a way to reset the singleton in-between tests\n<ul>\n<li>Use use a <code>_resetModuleScope</code> singleton for our tests</li>\n<li>...but this isn't exposed to users who may want to do their own tests around our router</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The JSX children <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> objects cause non-intuitive behavior based on idiomatic react expectations\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional runtime <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s won't get picked up</li>\n<li>Adding new <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s during local dev won't get picked up during HMR</li>\n<li>Using external state in your elements doesn't work as one might expect (see <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9225\">#9225</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, we are going to lift the singleton out into user-land, so that they create the router singleton and manage it outside the react tree - which is what react 18 is encouraging with <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> anyways! This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\nelement: &lt;Home /&gt;,\n}]\n}]);</p>\n<p>function App() {\nreturn &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>If folks still prefer the JSX notation, they can leverage <code>createRoutesFromElements</code> (aliased from <code>createRoutesFromChildren</code> since they are not &quot;children&quot; in this usage):</p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>let routes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n  &lt;/Route&gt;\n);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

support. This library always aims at supporting one EOLed LTS release which by this time now is 12.x which has reached EOL 30 Apr 2022.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the minified UMD build from the package.</p>\n<p>Minified code is hard to audit and since this is a widely used library it seems more appropriate nowadays to optimize for auditability than to ship a legacy module format that, at best, serves educational purposes nowadays.</p>\n<p>For production browser use cases, users should be using a bundler. For educational purposes, today's online sandboxes like replit.com offer convenient ways to load npm modules, so the use case for UMD through repos like UNPKG or jsDelivr has largely vanished.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drop IE 11 and Safari 10 support. Drop support for browsers that don't correctly implement const/let and default arguments, and no longer transpile the browser build to ES2015.</p>\n<p>This also removes the fallback on msCrypto instead of the crypto API.</p>\n<p>Browser tests are run in the first supported version of each supported browser and in the latest (as of this commit) version available on Browserstack.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>optimize uuid.v1 by 1.3x uuid.v4 by 4.3x (430%) (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/597\">#597</a>) (<a

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR intends to improve BoxPlot UX and apply Time Grain to all of the time columns in the `Distribute Across` control.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the default time column implicitly apply in the `Distribute Across` control until there are some columns set on this control. After this PR the default time column will explicitly display in `Distribute Across`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `Time Grian` also move below `Distribute Across` control and the time grain would apply to all of the time columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### After\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/192447148-cf96e5b8-a72d-4776-91ea-9f7190de0044.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n- Adds the `MetadataBar` to the Explore header\r\n- Improves the `MetadataBar` resize capabilities and changes the component to work with server-side timestamps\r\n- Changes the logic to get slice-related dashboards to use them in the metadata bar\r\n- Adds and adjusts tests\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc I didn't add a tooltip for the number of dashboards because it requires a future PR that will increment the 3 dots menu with the list of related dashboards. This will be made in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n@codyml @rusackas \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAnother casualty of #21315 was datasource switching for table chart: after that PR, switching between datasources wouldn't preserve any columns.  As a side-effect, saving charts based on SQL queries instead of datasets would fail, as the save process involves switching from the query datasource to the newly-created dataset.  This PR fixes the issue, which was specifically caused by #21315 turning `chartState.options` from an object into an array (see #21484).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__form_data_key=O3JVAVF3-mFhHkTJ8F3xoCyHzxNRoottQ-ZJcNMIx1KOzPpJ8ueK6R88J-zJyptf datasource_id=1 datasource_type=query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/191610999-22374190-c71f-4998-b621-d99f9230c939.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__form_data_key=gHVMJ2BnjkTUap0aWTVz-ocYbMr5xFS3xE1sV1c8x1gdIsAPqErF4pzNNsWhFqz3 datasource_id=1 datasource_type=query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/191611053-e01e91f6-f0db-447c-840f-3676feb2bf82.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIf the FF Generic Axis is enabled, the Pivot Table v2 will support multiple time columns with time grain. The `TIME GRAIN\r\n` control also moves out from the time section.\r\n\r\nThere is a limitation in the current design that the Adhoc Column wasn't able to apply the Time Grain, I will open separated PR to support the dynamic detector for the column type.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\nThe time grain is applied on `Order Date` and `Ship Date`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/191489566-e5172f11-8366-4a2e-86cb-892887122e53.png)\r\n\r\nThe time grain is applied on `Order Date` and `Ship Date` except `Category`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/191489860-3b9c48af-dae5-4147-9d44-ecdca4135b58.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe discovered that in queries that have aliases with the same name as tables, that removes said tables from the list returned in the `ParsedQuery` `tables` method. This affects the way we prevent users to access to certain tables, since they can circumvent the restricted access by retrieving data through subqueries that have the same alias as the name of the involved table.\r\nIn essence, this won't work:\r\n`select * from forbidden_table`\r\nThis will work:\r\n`select * from (select * from forbidden_table)  forbidden_table`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nA normal query shows that the table can't be accessed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1435\" alt=\"blocked\"

database: shows for users who can create databases, until their first non examples db is connected\r\nCreate dataset: shows for users who can create a dataset as soon as at least one non examples db is connected\r\n[no change] Connect Google Sheet: shows for users who can create databases, always\r\n[no change] Upload CSV, columnar, Excel: shows for users who can create databases all the time (tooltip when no csv uploads enabled, active when csv uploads enabled). For users who can upload but can't connect db, only shows once uploads are enabled on at least one db.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/191266353-16748a9c-fc3c-482a-8fb3-e4adc4ebe323.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/191266421-fd8b2822-efa6-4fe7-8ebf-3a4d9977bfb5.gif)\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/191268853-8e3d7ace-13e8-4d25-912b-862d5e410862.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR intends to generate a consistent QueryObject whether GenericAxis FF is enabled or disabled. e.g.: the charts wouldn't change on the Dashboard although Axis FF from `enabled` to `disabled` and vice versa.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that the charts on the Dashboards are consistent whether FF is enabled or disabled, so the FF GenericAxis should be safety enabled by default (will do in separated PR).\r\n2. Add unit test in Echart timeseries charts.\r\n3. Add unit test in Echart MixedTimeseries charts.\r\n4. Move `getXAxis` and `isXAxisSet` into `superset-ui/core`\r\n\r\nThere are 2 kinds of `queryObject` patterns after this PR:\r\n\r\n#### The QueryObjec will be like below when the `x_axis` is not in formData whether `GenericAxis` is enabled or disabled\r\n```\r\n{\r\n        granularity: 'time_column',\r\n        extras: { time_grain_sqla: 'P1Y', having: '', where: '' },\r\n        is_timeseries: true,\r\n        post_processing: [\r\n          {\r\n            operation: 'pivot',\r\n            options: {\r\n              aggregates: { 'count(*)': { operator: 'mean' } },\r\n              columns: ['col1'],\r\n              drop_missing_columns: true,\r\n              index: ['__timestamp'],\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n          { operation: 'flatten' },\r\n        ],\r\n      }\r\n     ....\r\n     ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The QueryObjec will be like below when the `x_axis` is in formData whether `GenericAxis` is enabled or disabled.\r\nThe `granularity`(axis) and `time_grain` will be converted to `BASE_AXIS`, then remove `time_grain_sqla` and `is_timeseries`\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n        extras: { having: '', where: '' },\r\n        columns: [\r\n          {\r\n            columnType: 'BASE_AXIS',\r\n            expressionType: 'SQL',\r\n            label: 'time_column',\r\n            sqlExpression: 'time_column',\r\n            timeGrain: 'P1Y',\r\n          },\r\n          'col1',\r\n        ],\r\n        post_processing: [\r\n          {\r\n            operation: 'pivot',\r\n            options: {\r\n              aggregates: { 'count(*)': { operator: 'mean' } },\r\n              columns: ['col1'],\r\n              drop_missing_columns: true,\r\n              index: ['time_column'],\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n          { operation: 'flatten' },\r\n        ],\r\n      }\r\n     ....\r\n     ....\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n#### Test Case 1\r\n1. Turn off GenericAxis\r\n2. Make an Echart time-series chart and a Mixed time-series, save to a new Dashboard.\r\n3. Turn on GenericAxis\r\n4. Refresh Dashboard\r\n5. Charts should be as before\r\n\r\n#### Test Case 2\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nWe're currently working on a new feature called cross-linking. As one of the examples of the feature, we want to show the dashboards related to a specific chart in the charts list and enable navigation and filtering. The screenshot below shows the concept:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-19 at 11 05 01 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/191037013-8827da7e-a01c-416a-8fff-2b3fe90a5c5c.png\">\r\n\r\nTo do that, this PR changes the charts list endpoint to also return the associated dashboards. The `superset/models/Dashboard` model already contains a `slices` property with a `backref` called `dashboards` which allows us to reference the dashboards from the `Slice` model. \r\n\r\nThis is the modified result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"result\": [{\r\n   \"id\": 122,\r\n   \"slice_name\": \"Test\",\r\n   \"dashboards\": [\r\n      {\r\n         \"dashboard_title\": \"Video Game Sales\",\r\n         \"id\": 9\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n         \"dashboard_title\": \"Test\",\r\n         \"id\": 17\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    ...\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also added the `dashboards` property to the list of searchable columns to allow queries in the form of:\r\n```\r\napi/v1/chart/?q=(filters:!((col:dashboards,opr:rel_m_m,value:17)), ...)\r\n````\r\nThis will allow us to add a Dashboards filter in the charts list screen to find all the charts of a particular dashboard.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Check that the dashboards are returned as expected.\r\n2 - Check that you can the charts list by a particular dashboard.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-19T14:27:47Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:34:03Z","closed_at":"2022-09-23T16:21:19Z","merged_at":"2022-09-23T16:21:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ec744da21c33c49cada569aaf3c5b5d9d7562f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"🚢

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn the current world, we have this problem:\r\n• SharedLabelColors are calculated when the dashboard loads, but only for the visible tab(s)\r\n• SharedLabelColors are only \"reserved\" if the label is used twice or more in the VISIBLE charts at load time.\r\n• This means if a label is used once at load time, and then used by another chart when a hidden tab is loaded, the color will be inconsistent.\r\n\r\nCurrent solution by @rusackas and @geido :\r\n• When loading the initial dashboard, make ALL labels use reserved colors... not just those that are used more than once. In other words, assume that ALL colors will be shared/reused.\r\n• Then, when you change tabs, any labels that are used the second time (or more) will already be in the SharedLabelColors \r\n• When loading/exposing a hidden tab, you might see a new series/label for the first time. These should also be added to SharedLabelColors, in case a third or subsequent tab uses those.\r\n\r\nModule Diagrams:\r\n![untitled@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/194922292-51538a3d-fa45-4d51-8732-fbd1485a43c6.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAs part of moving Explore to the SPA, #20498 replaced the previous single `POST /superset/explore` request that was used to save charts with calls to the v1 API.  The `PUT /api/v1/chart/{id}` endpoint responsible for updating the chart required sending the complete list of IDs of dashboards that the chart should be added to in the request body, and this list was previously sourced from the `form_data.dashboards` array returned by the `GET /api/v1/explore` endpoint.  However, `form_data.dashboards` is not updated when dashboards are deleted from Superset.  As a result, saving a chart that was added to a dashboard when that dashboard was deleted would result in the frontend submitting that dashboard in the `PUT` request, which would cause the request to fail.  This PR fixes this by getting the chart dashboards with a `GET /api/v1/chart/{id}` request during the explore save process, the results of which are correctly updated when dashboards are deleted.\r\n\r\n~Additionally, the Save Chart modal was configured to close immediately upon clicking the \"Save chart\" button, rather than waiting for requests to complete/fail and showing error messages on fail.  This PR also fixes this so errors are displayed correctly.~ **This PR now just fixes the broken saving, as the fix for the Save Chart modal closing before error message shows turned out to trigger other Explore display bugs that couldn't be quickly solved for this PR.**\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n**Saving a chart w/ dashboard deleted before:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/190811092-42255a80-023b-402b-9caa-78a1572e59d1.mov\r\n\r\n**Saving a chart w/ dashboard deleted after:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/191150662-10359f79-6151-4803-87f8-f9eee0d5eba6.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Create a chart, save it to a dashboard, delete the dashboard, then make a change to the chart and attempt to save again.  The chart should save correctly and opening the chart from the chart list again should show the saved version.  Additionally, verify in the inspector that the `PUT` request was successful, with no `422` error.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR rewrites the `ColorSchemeControl` component using Typescript and a functional component. The main reason for refactoring the component was that the previous version was re-rendering the `Select` component many times by mutating the `options` property when the user hovered the elements. This caused a bug in reordering the selected items when hovering in/out.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWe shouldn't have any function changes and the selected items should remain on top when hovering in/out.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes a regression when loading examples would trigger dataset `after_insert` SQLAlchemy event with `dataset.database` as `None`, previously these triggers for creating new permissions were a noop and a second trigger would occur with the expected database relation. Currently the second event does not occur, so this PR will handle `dataset.database` as `None` by fetching the database model itself.\r\n \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**Before**: after loading examples, not all datasource access permissions would be created (the number could vary)\r\n<img width=\"1197\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-09-16 at 14 03 37\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/190645236-4f40517e-dbaf-4b19-99a1-b9cc7df5090f.png\">\r\n\r\n**After**: All permissions are created has expected (23 datasets create 23 datasource access permissions)\r\n<img width=\"1192\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-09-16 at 11 52 27\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/190623313-62fbd232-20c9-4466-9623-2f5e8042c3ab.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSince the current Dashboard requests entire apis for runQuery all together, it easily exceeds the maximum parallel HTTP connections.\r\nThis commit introduces the `react-intersection-observer` to minimize the runQuery for charts. \r\nIt will only request the runQuery only if the current Chart is within the visible viewport. (As scroll down to the bottom chart, it will gradually request the remaining runQuery.)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- Before:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/190525695-ddbda65e-33a4-454f-aff0-138c2b8bb8c2.mov\r\n\r\n- After:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/190525690-1cb9c806-c89a-46bd-91d8-ebc471340096.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

databases require values that aren't in the sqlalchemy uri in order to connect. I'm passing in all properties from the validate_params api into the db_engine_spec for validation, instead of just the `parameters` so that we can continue to keep the client side api structure as similar as possible to the db database model and not have to add the same values in both the root db payload and parameters in order to do validation. This is some pre-work for adding in the databricks form that requires http_path from extras for connection.\r\n\r\nHopefully this change will help clarify the difference between parameters, and when something is a parameter in the db model and when it's not.\r\n\r\nI'm also adding the driver to the db model, because as per @betodealmeida's change in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21171 if an engine can have multiple drivers, like databricks, we're going to need to pass that value in from the client side when creating/editing a db in order for us to find the correct db_engine_spec.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nDatabase creation with the new forms should work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nSome db_engine_specs can have multiple db_engine_specs, Databricks for example.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn #21315, I refactored shared controls so feature flag checking for drag and drop was done in React render instead on module load.  As part of that, I modified the config object's `options` property to be an array instead of an object for some DnD shared controls, because non-DnD versions expected an array and I wanted to merge DnD and non-DnD config objects.  But, I missed a place where a `visibility` function expected an object, causing the Time Grain control to not appear when `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is enabled.  This PR fixes that issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**Before:**\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__form_data_key=Q2g3Sfv5XqzKpKsIiRHB1RIJN5YgORaHyI4gBNyg_eg3TyMDp8AEpDV72c2xJngw slice_id=116 preselect_filters=%7B%221389%22%3A+%7B%22platform%22%3A+%5B%22PS%22%2C+%22PS2%22%2C+%22PS3%22%2C+%22PS4%22%5D%2C+%22genr (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/190441930-f1c74760-4abd-4163-a1ea-c13854c0dd39.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__form_data_key=Q2g3Sfv5XqzKpKsIiRHB1RIJN5YgORaHyI4gBNyg_eg3TyMDp8AEpDV72c2xJngw slice_id=116 preselect_filters=%7B%221389%22%3A+%7B%22platform%22%3A+%5B%22PS%22%2C+%22PS2%22%2C+%22PS3%22%2C+%22PS4%22%5D%2C+%22genre%22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/190441979-987f27f7-bfaf-4753-b439-f7aca4463538.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe Table viz allows users to have little histogram/bar chart cells which can be gray, red when negative, or colorized via conditional formatting. Previously, these were implemented as the CSS background of the table cells, and a gradient was used to draw the bars, with gradient stops to set bar widths. This was problematic as people could not customized these with CSS, and it was also a potentially difficult to understand implementation from a maintenance standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn this revised approach, divs are conditionally added to table cells to act as these bars, and they're positioned behind the text content. They use a few small functions to calculate width, offset, and color for their display. They're also rendered with a `cell-bar` class and (when applicable) a `negative` or `positive` class to indicate if they're positive or negative, for further customization options.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"381\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/190426407-178e5a04-b5c8-49da-a4cb-6c7146d4b243.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo visual changes here - just representing what was changed.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen `allowNewOptions` was true and the options contained numbers as values, if the user searched for a value that already existed, the options would be duplicated because `hasOption` was not transforming the `string` input before comparing it with the existing values. Given that the possible value types are `string | number | null | undefined`, this PR changes that logic to use the equality operator (not strict) to compare the values.\r\n\r\n@cccs-RyanK \r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR improves the support for the `form_data` param in the old `/superset/explore` endpoint. Previously, the old endpoint only redirected the user to the new endpoint with the same original request parameters. Now, if `form_data` is present, the endpoint will persist that information in the cache and replace the parameter with `form_data_key`, the new supported format.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /superset/explore/?form_data=<object>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be redirected to\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /explore/?form_data_key=<key>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck that GET requests to the old endpoint are correctly redirected to the new endpoint with the correct parameters.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-14T17:29:52Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:33:19Z","closed_at":"2022-09-14T21:00:12Z","merged_at":"2022-09-14T21:00:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c7323a87def2a60581c162db34783a48307e9aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kgabryje","id":15073128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDczMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15073128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje","html_url":"https://github.com/kgabryje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"🚢

in the `engine`—which isn't apparent whether it refers to an external engine or Superset's metadata engine—when managing tags, this PR simply leverages the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension directly.\r\n\r\nNote it's not overly clear whether we should use `db.engine.execute(...)` or `db.session.execute(...)`, though per [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34322471/sqlalchemy-engine-connection-and-session-difference) it seems like the later is preferred when using the ORM functionality (as opposed to raw SQL).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any
