What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded option to provide Avro schema by URL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n(copied from Jira ticket)\r\n\r\nWe have a use case in which we read a huge table in Avro format. About 30k columns.\r\n\r\nusing the default Hive reader - `AvroGenericRecordReader` it is just hangs forever. after 4 hours not even one task has finished.\r\n\r\nWe tried instead to use `spark.read.format(\"com.databricks.spark.avro\").load(..)` but we failed on:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Found duplicate column(s) in the data schema\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.util.SchemaUtils$.checkColumnNameDuplication(SchemaUtils.scala:85)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.util.SchemaUtils$.checkColumnNameDuplication(SchemaUtils.scala:67)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:421)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.loadV1Source(DataFrameReader.scala:239)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:227)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:174)\r\n... 53 elided\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nbecause files schema contain duplicate column names (when considering case-insensitive).\r\n\r\nSo we wanted to provide a user schema with non-duplicated fields, but the schema is huge. a few MBs. it is not practical to provide it in json format.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo we patched spark-avro to be able to get also `avroSchemaUrl` in addition to `avroSchema` and it worked perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded a unitest to AvroSuite and tested locally with patched version\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-10T10:31:14Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T05:28:54Z","closed_at":"2021-02-14T21:44:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47949ff10fe96abae58778db8186231e4e8ed5ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12af2b76122079a3040bb9e438758bdc63d45cb0","head":{"label":"uzadude:avro_schema","ref":"avro_schema","sha":"12af2b76122079a3040bb9e438758bdc63d45cb0","user":{"login":"uzadude","id":15645757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15645757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude","html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62064979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjA2NDk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"uzadude/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uzadude","id":15645757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15645757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude","html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a predicate to guard against non-deterministic filters on partitioned table to be optimized by the optimization rule OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar to FileSourcePartitionPruning, OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery should only apply for deterministic filters. If filters are non-deterministic, they have to be evaluated against partitions separately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-10T07:13:07Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T06:37:47Z","closed_at":"2021-02-24T06:37:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5c2d9a6f1b4d0070d22dc9dd6e9b2203132859e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/050398bb49552721ff4aea51af6e1463f3fe2075","head":{"label":"yeshengm:minor-deterministic","ref":"minor-deterministic","sha":"050398bb49552721ff4aea51af6e1463f3fe2075","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

PR is a fix for the JLS 17.5.3 violation identified in\r\n@zsxwing's [19/Feb/19 11:47 comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20977?focusedCommentId=16772277&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16772277) on the JIRA.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Use a var field to hold the state of the collection accumulator \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAccumulatorV2 auto-registration of accumulator during readObject doesn't work with final fields that are post-processed outside readObject. As it stands incompletely initialized objects are published to heartbeat thread. This leads to sporadic exceptions knocking out executors which increases the cost of the jobs.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllow users to have Spark attempt to decommission excluded executors. \r\nSince excluded executors may be flaky, this also adds the ability for users to specify a time limit after which a decommissioning executor will be killed by Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis may help prevent fetch failures from excluded executors, and also handle the situation in which executors \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, two new configuration flags for the behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes the RemoveNoopOperators only remove attribute only projects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRemoveNoopOperators can remove non-trivial projections that contain actual expressions instead of just attributes, when that expression reuses the expression id of its input. This is a problem with self unions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test + regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCode in the PR generates random parameters for hyperparameter tuning. A discussion with Sean Owen can be found on the dev mailing list here:\r\n\r\nhttp://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Hyperparameter-Optimization-via-Randomization-td30629.html\r\n\r\nAll code is entirely my own work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRandomization can be a more effective techinique than a grid search since min/max points can fall between the grid and never be found. Randomisation is not so restricted although the probability of finding minima/maxima is dependent on the number of attempts. \r\n\r\nAlice Zheng has an accessible description on how this technique works at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/evaluating-machine-learning/9781492048756/ch04.html\r\n\r\nAlthough there are Python libraries with more sophisticated techniques, not every Spark developer is using Python. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nA new class (`ParamRandomBuilder.scala`) and its tests have been created but there is no change to existing code. This class offers an alternative to `ParamGridBuilder` and can be dropped into the code wherever `ParamGridBuilder` appears.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCode in the PR generates random parameters for hyperparameter tuning. A discussion with Sean Owen can be found on the dev mailing list here:\r\n\r\nhttp://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Hyperparameter-Optimization-via-Randomization-td30629.html\r\n\r\nAll code is entirely my own work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRandomization can be a more effective techinique than a grid search since min/max points can fall between the grid and never be found. Randomisation is not so restricted although the probability of finding minima/maxima is dependent on the number of attempts. \r\n\r\nAlice Zheng has an accessible description on how this technique works at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/evaluating-machine-learning/9781492048756/ch04.html\r\n\r\nAlthough there are Python libraries with more sophisticated techniques, not every Spark developer is using Python. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nA new class (`ParamRandomBuilder.scala`) and its tests have been created but there is no change to existing code. This class offers an alternative to `ParamGridBuilder` and can be dropped into the code wherever `ParamGridBuilder` appears. Indeed, it extends `ParamGridBuilder` and is completely compatible with  its interface. It merely adds one method that provides a range over which a hyperparameter will be randomly defined.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests `ParamRandomBuilderSuite.scala` and `RandomRangesSuite.scala` were added.\r\n\r\n`ParamRandomBuilderSuite` is the analogue of the already existing `ParamGridBuilderSuite` which tests the user-facing interface.\r\n\r\n`RandomRangesSuite` uses ScalaCheck to test the random ranges over which hyperparameters are distributed.","created_at":"2021-02-09T10:51:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T11:44:36Z","closed_at":"2021-02-09T11:43:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07260bdaf849bada1d14cb9b1951cbc6f8be8094","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef7bfd75a5dd2418bcbd05d86ecfe4cabac04b83","head":{"label":"PhillHenry:master","ref":"master","sha":"ef7bfd75a5dd2418bcbd05d86ecfe4cabac04b83","user":{"login":"PhillHenry","id":1458470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTg0NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1458470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry","html_url":"https://github.com/PhillHenry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhillHenry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7ea3a336b99915f09174a4c3e47fa17f30b88890","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis follows up #31160 to update score function in the document.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we use `f_classif`, `ch2`, `f_regression`, which sound to me the sklearn's naming. It is good to have it but I think it is nice if we have formal score function name with sklearn's ones.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, only doc change.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-09T01:35:14Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:50Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T00:25:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4a0807e960c72e31b4bfcfd3a0b72fa01b06792","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ee9913cee859586ba02a4e8089f8fac1db3d788","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-34080-minor","ref":"SPARK-34080-minor","sha":"2ee9913cee859586ba02a4e8089f8fac1db3d788","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new option `datetimeRebaseMode` for the Avro datasource. The option influences on loading ancient dates and timestamps column values from avro files. \r\n\r\nThe option supports the same values as the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` namely;\r\n- `\"LEGACY\"`, when an option is set to this value, Spark rebases dates/timestamps from the legacy hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n- `\"CORRECTED\"`, dates/timestamps are read AS IS from avro files.\r\n- `\"EXCEPTION\"`, when it is set as an option value, Spark will fail the reading if it sees ancient dates/timestamps that are ambiguous between the two calendars.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. New options will allow to load avro files from at least two sources in different rebasing modes in the same query. For instance:\r\n```scala\r\nval df1 = spark.read.option(\"datetimeRebaseMode\", \"legacy\").format(\"avro\").load(folder1)\r\nval df2 = spark.read.option(\"datetimeRebaseMode\", \"corrected\").format(\"avro\").load(folder2)\r\ndf1.join(df2, ...)\r\n```\r\nBefore the changes, it is impossible because the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` influences on both reads.\r\n\r\n2. Mixing of Dataset/DataFrame and RDD APIs should become possible. Since SQL configs are not propagated through RDDs, the following code fails on ancient timestamps:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\", \"legacy\")\r\nspark.read.format(\"avro\").load(folder).distinct.rdd.collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-02-08T20:17:39Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T06:23:17Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T06:23:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b375954985e6ae3937fd4c2dc1b87aadcc1e917d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c930fd975575e9e4f42a180cd42da6a25e7322c6","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-rebase-options","ref":"avro-rebase-options","sha":"c930fd975575e9e4f42a180cd42da6a25e7322c6","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/pull/3391 is merged, This PR changes the facetFilters of Docsearch as 3.1.1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSo that the search result of the published Spark site will points to https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1 instead of https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/. \r\nThis is useful for searching the docs of 3.1.1 after more new Spark releases in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the search result of 3.1.1 Spark doc site is based on https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1 instead of https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nJust configuration

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd value check before setLcoalProperty if key is `spark.job.interruptOnCancel`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nChecking config when setting is better than using.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `spark.job.interruptOnCancel` value will fallback to `false` if it's not a legal Boolean. E.g., a user has such code `sc.setLocalProperty(\"spark.job.interruptOnCancel\", \"ture\")` and Spark will use `false` instead silently if need kill tasks.\r\n\r\nThis PR try to add a pre check when user set local property, and throw expcetion if the value is not a Boolean.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are 3 ways to use Guava cache in spark code:\r\n\r\n1. `Loadingcache` is the main way to use Guava cache in spark code and the key usages are as follows:\r\n  a. `LoadingCache` with `maximumsize` data eviction policy, such as `appCache` in `ApplicationCache`, `cache` in `Codegenerator`\r\n  b. `LoadingCache` with `maximumWeight` data eviction policy, such as `shuffleIndexCache` in `ExternalShuffleBlockResolver`\r\n  c. `LoadingCache` with 'expireAfterWrite' data eviction policy, such as `tableRelationCache` in `SessionCatalog`\r\n2. `ManualCache` is another way to use Guava cache in spark code and the key usage is `cache` in `SharedInMemoryCache`, it use to caches partition file statuses in memory\r\n\r\n3. The last use way is `hadoopJobMetadata` in `SparkEnv`, it uses Guava Cache to build a `soft-reference map`.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pr is use `Caffeine` instead of `Guava Cache` because `Caffeine` is faster than `Guava Cache` from benchmarks, the main changes as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Add `Caffeine` deps to maven `pom.xml`\r\n\r\n2. Use `Caffeine` instead of Guava `LoadingCache`, `ManualCache` and soft-reference map in `SparkEnv`\r\n\r\n3. Add `LocalCacheBenchmark` to compare performance of `Loadingcache` between `Guava Cache` and `Caffeine`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Caffeine` is faster than `Guava Cache` from benchmarks\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Add `LocalCacheBenchmark` to compare performance of `Loadingcache` between `Guava Cache` and `Caffeine`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for SPARK-34346 which causes a flakiness due to `core-site.xml` test resource file addition.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the POD allocator to use the scheduler backend to get the known executors and remove those from the pending and newly created list. \r\n\r\nThis is different from the normal `ExecutorAllocationManager` requested killing of executors where the  `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout` is used.\r\nIn this case POD allocator kills the executors which  should be only responsible for terminating not satisfied POD allocations (new requests where no POD state is received yet and PODs in pending state). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause there is race between executor POD allocator and cluster scheduler backend.\r\nRunning several experiment during downscaling we experienced a lot of killed fresh executors wich has already running task on them.\r\n\r\nThe pattern in the log was the following (see executor 312 and TID 2079):\r\n\r\n```\r\n21/02/01 15:12:03 INFO ExecutorMonitor: New executor 312 has registered (new total is 138)\r\n...\r\n21/02/01 15:12:03 INFO TaskSetManager: Starting task 247.0 in stage 4.0 (TID 2079, 100.100.18.138, executor 312, partition 247, PROCESS_LOCAL, 8777 bytes)\r\n21/02/01 15:12:03 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Deleting 3 excess pod requests (408,312,307).\r\n...\r\n21/02/01 15:12:04 ERROR TaskSchedulerImpl: Lost executor 312 on 100.100.18.138: The executor with id 312 was deleted by a user or the framework.\r\n21/02/01 15:12:04 INFO TaskSetManager: Task 2079 failed because while it was being computed, its executor exited for a reason unrelated to the task. Not counting this failure towards the maximum number of failures for the task.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Manually\r\n\r\nWith this change there was no executor lost with running task on it.  \r\n\r\n##### With unit test\r\n\r\nA new test is added and existing test is modified to check these cases.","created_at":"2021-02-07T19:20:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T11:26:22Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T00:59:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08d5b1ba9d378e18813d064dc2fbb017c6cc638e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bb578d296e77af20b4c3a006ac0349a84630fdad","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-34361","ref":"SPARK-34361","sha":"bb578d296e77af20b4c3a006ac0349a84630fdad","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

I don't like:\r\n\r\n1. We're still calling `convertSpecialDate/Timestamp` just as much as the previous solution as it's called twice in the `parse()` methods.\r\n2. `DateFormatter.getPartitioningFormatter` and `TimestampFormatter.getPartitioningFormatter` are duplicating the legacy format stuff in `DateFormatter.apply` and `TimestampFormatter.apply``` respectively.\r\n\r\n1) Could be solved by extracting the parse logic from e.g. Iso8601DateFormatter into some mthod with a `considerSpecial` flag.  This would come at the cost of the code more difficult to read. E.g. we might need an extra abstract base class.\r\n\r\n2) Can only be solved if we decide we don't need to support legacy formats, but this would be a breaking change with the previous code.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-07T13:14:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-07T13:15:25Z","closed_at":"2021-02-07T13:15:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69a6ebb3aa52b7daee031ffbc150fb4f029fad6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d469982e50f4250da8d32e3320254a65cbe36a55","head":{"label":"d80tb7:f/special-timestamp-partitions-alt","ref":"f/special-timestamp-partitions-alt","sha":"d469982e50f4250da8d32e3320254a65cbe36a55","user":{"login":"d80tb7","id":5367773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjc3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5367773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7","html_url":"https://github.com/d80tb7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178736402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg3MzY0MDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"d80tb7/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d80tb7","id":5367773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjc3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5367773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7","html_url":"https://github.com/d80tb7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d80tb7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d80tb7/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new function `DelegateFunction`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDelegate is just like a big box that can include some other expressions. It will execute all of children and return the last child result as its result.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe origin idea is from debug. Debug SQL is hard since SQL is always quite long and complex. This new function can help debug with inject some help functions, e.g., `println, sleep, raise_error`.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTwo usage examples:\r\n```sql\r\n-- 1\r\n-- raw sql\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t1\r\nSELECT coalesce(c1, c2) as c FROM t2\r\n \r\n-- print the column data\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t1\r\nSELECT delegate(\r\njava_method('scala.Console', 'println', concat('c1: ', c1, ', c2: ', c2)),\r\ncoalesce(c1, c2)\r\n) as c FROM t2\r\n \r\n-- 2\r\n-- raw sql\r\nSELECT if(spark_partition_id() = 1, c1, raise_error('test error')) FROM t2\r\n \r\n-- add a sleep time before throw error\r\nSELECT if(spark_partition_id() = 1, c1, delegate(\r\njava_method('java.lang.Thread', 'sleep', 3000l),\r\nraise_error('test error')\r\n)) FROM t2\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `SHOW COLUMNS` as  table-valued function 'show_columns'\r\nIn origin, we can't directly analysis column metadata information  in SQL, we need export it out and then analysis on it. \r\nNow, we can just use SQL to do this.\r\n\r\nAnalysis columns count? check column name with regex like ecth\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake it convenient for user to analysis metadata\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use `show_columns` table-valued function such as .\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31133 Avro schema evolution is introduce for partitioned hive tables where the schema is given by `avro.schema.literal`. \r\nHere that functionality is extended to support schema evolution where the schema is defined via `avro.schema.url`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR the problem described in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31133 can be reproduced by tables where `avro.schema.url` is used. As in this case always the property value given at partition level is used for the `avro.schema.url`.\r\n\r\nSo for example when a new column (with a default value) is added to the table then one the following problem happens:\r\n-  when the new field is added after the last one the cell values will be null values instead of the default value\r\n-  when the schema is extended somewhere before the last field then values will be listed for the wrong column positions\r\n\r\nSimilar error will happen when one of the field is removed from the schema.\r\n\r\nFor details please check the attached unit tests where both cases are checked.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFixes the potential value error. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing unit tests for schema evolution is generalized and reused. \r\nNew tests:\r\n- `SPARK-34370: support Avro schema evolution (add column with avro.schema.url)`\r\n- `SPARK-34370: support Avro schema evolution (remove column with

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to propagate the name used for registering UDFs to `ScalaUDF`, `ScalaUDAF` and `ScaalAggregator`.\r\n\r\nNote that `PythonUDF` gets the name correctly: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/466c045bfac20b6ce19f5a3732e76a5de4eb4e4a/python/pyspark/sql/udf.py#L358-L359\r\n, and same for Hive UDFs:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/466c045bfac20b6ce19f5a3732e76a5de4eb4e4a/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveSessionCatalog.scala#L67\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR can help in the following scenarios:\r\n1) Better EXPLAIN output\r\n2) By adding  `def name: String` to `UserDefinedExpression`, we can match an expression by `UserDefinedExpression` and look up the catalog, an use case needed for #31273.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe EXPLAIN output involving udfs will be changed to use the name used for UDF registration.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION test_udf AS 'org.apache.spark.examples.sql.Spark33084'\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT test_udf(col1) FROM VALUES (1), (2), (3)\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\nThe output of the optimized plan will change from:\r\n```\r\nAggregate [spark33084(cast(col1#223 as bigint), org.apache.spark.examples.sql.Spark33084@6906be0f, 1, 1) AS spark33084(col1)#237]\r\n+- LocalRelation [col1#223]\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nAggregate [test_udf(cast(col1#223 as bigint), org.apache.spark.examples.sql.Spark33084@7a62d697, 1, 1, Some(test_udf)) AS test_udf(col1)#237]\r\n+- LocalRelation [col1#223]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

In particular:\r\n\r\n1. Extend the logical node `RepairTable`, and add two new flags `enableAddPartitions` and `enableDropPartitions`.\r\n2. Add similar flags to the v1 execution node `AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommand`\r\n3. Add new method `dropPartitions()` to `AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommand` which drops partitions from the catalog if their locations in the file system don't exist.\r\n4. Updated public docs about the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` command:\r\n<img width=\"1037\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-02-16 at 13 46 39\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1580697/108052607-7446d280-705d-11eb-8e25-7398254787a4.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses #31097\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The changes allow to recover tables with removed partitions. The example below portraits the problem:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl2 (col int, part int) partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl2 partition (part=1) select 1;\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl2 partition (part=0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> show table extended like 'tbl2' partition (part = 0);\r\ndefault\ttbl2\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/spark-warehouse/tbl2/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\nRemove the partition (part = 0) from the filesystem:\r\n```\r\n$ rm -rf /Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/spark-warehouse/tbl2/part=0\r\n```\r\nEven after recovering, we cannot query the table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> msck repair table tbl2;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl2;\r\n21/01/08 22:49:13 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [select * from tbl2]\r\norg.apache.hadoop.mapred.InvalidInputException: Input path does not exist: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/spark-warehouse/tbl2/part=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n- To have feature parity with Hive: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-RecoverPartitions(MSCKREPAIRTABLE)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, we can query recovered table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> msck repair table tbl2 sync partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl2;\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> show partitions tbl2;\r\npart=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *MsckRepairTableParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *PlanResolutionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableRecoverPartitionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableRecoverPartitionsParallelSuite\"\r\n```\r\n- Added unified v1 and v2 tests for `MSCK REPAIR TABLE`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

changes needed?\r\n1. To be compatible with v1 implementation of the Parquet datasource.\r\n2. To improve UX with Spark SQL by making `SparkUpgradeException` more visible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to optimize WAL commit phase via following changes:\r\n\r\n* cache offset log to avoid FS get operation per batch\r\n* just directly delete instead of employing FS list operation on purge\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere're inefficiency on WAL commit phase which can be easily optimized via using a small driver memory.\r\n\r\n1. To provide the offset metadata to source side (via `source.commit()`), we read offset metadata for previous batch from file system, which is probably written by this driver in previous batches. Caching it into driver memory would reduce the get operation.\r\n2. Spark calls purge against offset log & commit log per batch, which calls list operation. If the previous batch succeeded to purge, the current batch just needs to check one batch which can be simply done via direct delete operation, instead of calling list operation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with additional debug log. (Verified that cache is used, cache keeps the size as 2, only one delete call is used instead of list call)\r\n\r\nDid some experiment with simple rate to console query. (NOTE: wasn't done with master branch - tested against Spark 2.4.x, but WAL commit phase hasn't been changed AFAIK during these versions)\r\n\r\nAWS S3 + S3 guard:\r\n\r\n> before the

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to support `ifExists` flag for v2 `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES` command. Currently, the flag is not respected and the command behaves as `ifExists = true` where the command always succeeds when the properties do not exist.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support `ifExists` flag and align with v1 command behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now if the property does not exist and `IF EXISTS` is not specified, the command will fail:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE t UNSET TBLPROPERTIES ('unknown') // Fails with \"Attempted to unset non-existent property 'unknown'\"\r\nALTER TABLE t UNSET TBLPROPERTIES IF EXISTS ('unknown') // OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllow users to configure a maximum amount of shuffle blocks to be stored and reject remote shuffle blocks when this threshold is exceeded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn disk constrained environments with large amount of shuffle data, migrations may result in excessive disk pressure on the nodes. On Kube nodes this can result in cascading failures when combined with `emptyDir`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new configuration parameter.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

 #31460 to 3.0\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn many real-world cases, when interacting with hive catalog through Spark SQL, users may just share the `hive-site.xml` for their hive jobs and make a copy to `SPARK_HOME`/conf w/o modification. In Spark, when we generate Hadoop configurations, we will use `spark.buffer.size(65536)` to reset `io.file.buffer.size(4096)`. But when we load the hive-site.xml, we may ignore this behavior and reset `io.file.buffer.size` again according to `hive-site.xml`.\r\n\r\n1. The configuration priority for setting Hadoop and Hive config here is not right, while literally, the order should be `spark > spark.hive > spark.hadoop > hive > hadoop`\r\n\r\n2. This breaks `spark.buffer.size` congfig's behavior for tuning the IO performance w/ HDFS if there is an existing `io.file.buffer.size` in hive-site.xml\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbugfix for configuration behavior and fix performance regression by that behavior change\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nthis pr restores silent user face change\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fix an issue that `java.sql.RowId` is mapped to `LongType` and prefer `StringType`.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, JDBC RowID type is mapped to `LongType` except for `OracleDialect`, but there is no guarantee to be able to convert RowID to long.\r\n`java.sql.RowId` declares `toString` and the specification of `java.sql.RowId` says\r\n\r\n> _all methods on the RowId interface must be fully implemented if the JDBC driver supports the data type_\r\n(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/RowId.html)\r\n\r\nSo, we should prefer StringType to LongType.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProvide the (configurable) ability to perform Avro-to-Catalyst schema field matching using the position of the fields instead of their names. A new `option` is added for the Avro datasource, `positionalFieldMatching`, which instructs `AvroSerializer`/`AvroDeserializer` to perform positional field matching instead of matching by name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis by-name matching is somewhat recent; prior to PR #24635, at least on the write path, schemas were matched by positionally (\"structural\" comparison). While by-name is better behavior as a default, it will be better to make this configurable by a user. Even at the time that PR #24635 was handled, there was [interest in making this behavior configurable](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24635#issuecomment-494205251), but it appears it went unaddressed.\r\n\r\nThere is precedence for configurability of this behavior as seen in PR #29737, which added this support for ORC. Besides this precedence, the behavior of Hive is to perform matching positionally ([ref](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AvroSerDe#AvroSerDe-WritingtablestoAvrofiles)), so this is behavior that Hadoop/Hive ecosystem users are familiar with.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new option is provided for the Avro datasource, `positionalFieldMatching`, which provides compatibility with Hive and pre-3.0.0 Spark behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests are added within `AvroSuite`, `AvroSchemaHelperSuite`, and `AvroSerdeSuite`; and most of the existing tests within `AvroSerdeSuite` are adapted to perform the same test using by-name and positional matching to ensure feature

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new options for the Parquet datasource:\r\n1. `datetimeRebaseMode`\r\n2. `int96RebaseMode`\r\n\r\nBoth options influence on loading ancient dates and timestamps column values from parquet files. The `datetimeRebaseMode` option impacts on loading values of the `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` and `TIMESTAMP_MILLIS` types, `int96RebaseMode` impacts on loading of `INT96` timestamps.\r\n\r\nThe options support the same values as the SQL configs `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` and `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInRead` namely;\r\n- `\"LEGACY\"`, when an option is set to this value, Spark rebases dates/timestamps from the legacy hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n- `\"CORRECTED\"`, dates/timestamps are read AS IS from parquet files.\r\n- `\"EXCEPTION\"`, when it is set as an option value, Spark will fail the reading if it sees ancient dates/timestamps that are ambiguous between the two calendars.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. New options will allow to load parquet files from at least two sources in different rebasing modes in the same query. For instance:\r\n```scala\r\nval df1 = spark.read.option(\"datetimeRebaseMode\", \"legacy\").parquet(folder1)\r\nval df2 = spark.read.option(\"datetimeRebaseMode\", \"corrected\").parquet(folder2)\r\ndf1.join(df2, ...)\r\n```\r\nBefore the changes, it is impossible because the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead`  influences on both reads.\r\n\r\n2. Mixing of Dataset/DataFrame and RDD APIs should become possible. Since SQL configs are not propagated through RDDs, the following code fails on ancient timestamps:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\", \"legacy\")\r\nspark.read.parquet(folder).distinct.rdd.collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV2Suite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-02-05T12:30:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T13:28:56Z","closed_at":"2021-02-08T13:28:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"800ad7c29c32a589427d9bd9e87d431657ff9450","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocumentation for `SparkSession.conf.isModifiable` is missing from the Python API site, so we added a Configuration section to the Spark SQL page to expose docs for the `RuntimeConfig` class (the class containing `isModifiable`). Then a `:class:` reference to `RuntimeConfig` was added to the `SparkSession.conf` docstring to create a link there as well. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo docs were generated for `pyspark.sql.conf.RuntimeConfig`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes--a new Configuration section to the Spark SQL page and a `Returns` section of the `SparkSession.conf` docstring, so this will now show a link to the `pyspark.sql.conf.RuntimeConfig` page. This is a change compared to both the released Spark version and the unreleased master branch.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFirst built the Python docs:\r\n```bash\r\ncd $SPARK_HOME/docs\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 SKIP_SQLDOC=1 jekyll serve\r\n```\r\nThen verified all pages and links:\r\n1.

 #31460  to branch 3.1\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many real-world cases, when interacting with hive catalog through Spark SQL, users may just share the `hive-site.xml` for their hive jobs and make a copy to `SPARK_HOME`/conf w/o modification. In Spark, when we generate Hadoop configurations, we will use `spark.buffer.size(65536)` to reset `io.file.buffer.size(4096)`. But when we load the hive-site.xml, we may ignore this behavior and reset `io.file.buffer.size` again according to `hive-site.xml`.\r\n\r\n1. The configuration priority for setting Hadoop and Hive config here is not right, while literally, the order should be `spark > spark.hive > spark.hadoop > hive > hadoop`\r\n\r\n2. This breaks `spark.buffer.size` congfig's behavior for tuning the IO performance w/ HDFS if there is an existing `io.file.buffer.size` in hive-site.xml\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbugfix for configuration behavior and fix performance regression by that behavior change\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nthis pr restores silent user face change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding a new \"number of matched pairs\" metric to track number of pairs processed out of join.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOften users face a scenario where even a modest skew in a join can lead to tasks appearing to be stuck, due to the O(n^2) nature of a join considering all pairs of rows with matching keys. When this happens users think that spark has gotten deadlocked. If there is a bound condition, the \"number of output rows\" metric may look typical. Other metrics may look very modest (eg: shuffle read). In those cases, it is very hard to understand what the problem is. There is no conclusive proof without getting a heap dump and looking at some internal data structures.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better if spark had a metric(which we propose be titled “number of matched pairs” as a companion to “number of output rows”) which showed the user how many pairs were being processed in the join. This would get updated in the live UI (when metrics get collected during heartbeats), so the user could easily see what was going on.\r\n\r\nThis would even help in cases where there was some other cause of a stuck executor (eg. network issues) just to disprove this theory. For example, you may have 100k records with the same key on each side of a join. That probably won't really show up as extreme skew in task input data. But it'll become 10B join pairs that spark works through, in one task. See  the Jira description for an example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users will be able to see a new \"number of matched pairs\" metric whenever they look at a join node in the UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded appropriate unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-04T20:10:03Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T00:07:05Z","closed_at":"2021-06-25T00:07:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be607490e10b530b37632e0ea5aefa452e13a396","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31477/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31477/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31477/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c35275fa7c670cd18c16548f36cd6184ec155ff","head":{"label":"sririshindra:SPARK-34369","ref":"SPARK-34369","sha":"4c35275fa7c670cd18c16548f36cd6184ec155ff","user":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245021426,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDUwMjE0MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"sririshindra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add a few public API change to DS v2, to make DS v2 scan can report metrics to Spark.\r\n\r\nTwo public interfaces are added.\r\n\r\n* `CustomMetric`: metric interface at the driver side. It basically defines how Spark aggregates task metrics with the same metric name.\r\n* `CustomTaskMetric`: task metric reported at executors. It includes a name and long value. Spark will collect these metric values and update internal metrics.\r\n\r\nThere are two public methods added to existing public interfaces. They are optional to DS v2 implementations.\r\n\r\n* `PartitionReader.currentMetricsValues()`: returns an array of `CustomTaskMetric`. Here is where the actual metrics values are collected. Empty array by default.\r\n* `Scan.supportedCustomMetrics()`: returns an array of supported custom metrics `CustomMetric`. Empty array by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn order to report custom metrics, we need some public API change in DS v2 to make it possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis only adds interfaces. In follow-up PRs where adding implementation there will be tests added. See #31451 and #31398 for some details and manual test there.","created_at":"2021-02-04T19:50:24Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T17:01:27Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T13:22:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e88387f11a65b5c5ae3e5855170a7d8cdd40c4be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31476/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31476/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31476/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb9d94a07a38d6efcd71f12cc1c2db22bf8a7019","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-34366","ref":"SPARK-34366","sha":"eb9d94a07a38d6efcd71f12cc1c2db22bf8a7019","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new analysis rule `DeduplicateRelations`, which deduplicates any duplicate relations in a plan first and then deduplicates conflicting attributes(which resued the `dedupRight` of `ResolveReferences`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`CostBasedJoinReorder` could fail when applying on self-join, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// test in JoinReorderSuite\r\ntest(\"join reorder with self-join\") {\r\n  val plan = t2.join(t1, Inner, Some(nameToAttr(\"t1.k-1-2\") === nameToAttr(\"t2.k-1-5\")))\r\n      .select(nameToAttr(\"t1.v-1-10\"))\r\n      .join(t2, Inner, Some(nameToAttr(\"t1.v-1-10\") === nameToAttr(\"t2.k-1-5\")))\r\n\r\n    // this can fail\r\n    Optimize.execute(plan.analyze)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBesides, with the new rule `DeduplicateRelations`, we'd be able to enable some optimizations, e.g., LeftSemiAnti pushdown, redundant project removal, as reflects in updated unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded and updated unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30701. It uses properties of `hadoop-client-api.artifact`, `hadoop-client-runtime.artifact` and `hadoop-client-minicluster.artifact` explicitly to set the dependencies and versions.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it is logically incorrect. For example, if you build with Hadoop 2, this dependency becomes `hadoop-client-api:2.7.4` internally, which does not exist in Hadoop 2 (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-client-api).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To fix the logical incorrectness.\r\n- It fixes a potential issue: this actually caused an issue when `generate-sources` plugin is used together with Hadoop 2 by default, which attempts to pull 2.7.4 of `hadoop-client-api`, `hadoop-client-runtime` and `hadoop-client-minicluster` for whatever reason.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo for users and dev. It's more a cleanup.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checked the dependencies are correctly placed.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-04T05:51:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:55:04Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T08:31:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a5045593617351c7bb206ecf6a70fc8ec9f8360","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03eec64d554621315b198cc7a1f78be08dc77b67","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33212","ref":"SPARK-33212","sha":"03eec64d554621315b198cc7a1f78be08dc77b67","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBoth methods are semantically the same so it might be better to use the utility one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to expose the number of total paths in Utils.buildLocationMetadata(), with relaxing space usage a bit (around 10+ chars).\r\n\r\nSuppose the first 2 of 5 paths are only fit to the threshold, the outputs between the twos are below:\r\n\r\n* before the change: `[path1, path2]`\r\n* after the change: `(5 paths)[path1, path2, ...]`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-31793 silently truncates the paths hence end users can't indicate how many paths are truncated, and even more, whether paths are truncated or not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the location metadata will also show how many paths are truncated (not shown), instead of silently truncated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n1. in `CatalogImpl.uncacheTable`, invalidate caches in cascade when the target table is \r\n a temp view, and `spark.sql.legacy.storeAnalyzedPlanForView` is false (default value).\r\n2. make `SessionCatalog.lookupTempView` public and return processed temp view plan (i.e., with `View` op).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing [SPARK-34052](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34052) (#31107), we should invalidate in cascade for `CatalogImpl.uncacheTable` when the table is a temp view, so that the behavior is consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now `SQLContext.uncacheTable` will drop temp view in cascade by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUserDefinedType and UDTRegistration become public Developer APIs, not package-private to Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis proposes to simply open up the UserDefinedType class as a developer API. It was public in 1.x, but closed in 2.x for some possible redesign that does not seem to have happened.\r\n\r\nOther libraries have managed to define UDTs anyway by inserting shims into the Spark namespace, and this evidently has worked OK. But package isolation in Java 9+ breaks this.\r\n\r\nThe logic here is mostly: this is de facto a stable API, so can at least be open to developers with the usual caveats about developer APIs.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n- Is there in fact some important redesign that's needed before opening it? The comment to this effect is from 2016\r\n- Is this all that needs to be opened up? Like PythonUserDefinedType?\r\n- Should any of this be kept package-private?\r\n\r\nThis was first proposed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16478 though it was a larger change, but, the other API issues it was fixing seem to have been addressed already (e.g. no need to return internal Spark types). It was never really reviewed.\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that there isn't much downside, and some upside, to just opening this as-is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUserDefinedType becomes visible to developers to subclass.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests; there is no change to the existing logic.","created_at":"2021-02-03T15:56:32Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T02:20:35Z","closed_at":"2021-02-20T13:32:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dedb60c3fb9e4e32e3216d1a9117eb5248dfe66c","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8231906312b4f4a18067e3aae1ac12a16894149f","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-7768","ref":"SPARK-7768","sha":"8231906312b4f4a18067e3aae1ac12a16894149f","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://git

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn many real-world cases, when interacting with hive catalog through Spark SQL, users may just share the `hive-site.xml` for their hive jobs and make a copy to `SPARK_HOME`/conf w/o modification. In Spark, when we generate Hadoop configurations, we will use `spark.buffer.size(65536)` to reset `io.file.buffer.size(4096)`. But when we load the hive-site.xml, we may ignore this behavior and reset `io.file.buffer.size` again according to `hive-site.xml`.\r\n\r\n1. The configuration priority for setting Hadoop and Hive config here is not right, while literally, the order should be `spark > spark.hive > spark.hadoop > hive > hadoop`\r\n\r\n2. This breaks `spark.buffer.size` congfig's behavior for tuning the IO performance w/ HDFS if there is an existing `io.file.buffer.size` in hive-site.xml\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbugfix for configuration behavior and fix performance regression by that behavior change\r\n \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nthis pr restores silent user face change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSkip the zinc related  installation operations on aarch64 platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe standalone zinc is not supported well on aarch64, so that the error ouput, `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error` dumped after build/mvn is called.\r\n\r\nThis patch try to skip the zinc installation and related operations on aarch64 to make sure the error output doesn't print again on aarch64.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nsimple cmd: `build/mvn -v`, see no error ouput again in aarch64, and nothing changed on x86\r\n\r\n- on AArch64 Ubuntu\r\n```\r\nroot@yikun-arm:~/dev/spark# uname -a\r\nLinux yikun-arm

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims two goals.\r\n1. Support ZSTD JNI BufferPool feature by adding a new configuration, `spark.io.compression.zstd.bufferPool.enabled`, for Apache Spark 3.2.0.\r\n2. Make Spark independent from ZSTD JNI library's default buffer pool policy change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nZSTD JNI library has different behaviors across its versions.\r\n\r\n| Version | Description | Commit |\r\n| ---------- | --------------- | ----------- |\r\n| v1.4.5-7 | `BufferPool` was added and used it by default | https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/commit/4f55c8917216518d7390eb0624bee3bf0e2c491a |\r\n| v1.4.5-8 | `RecyclingBufferPool` was added and `BufferPool` became an interface to allow custom BufferPool implementation | https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/commit/dd2588edd302823fa534de1516e4ae6d6dc6417e |\r\n| v1.4.7+ | `NoPool` is used by default and user should specify buffer pool explicitly | https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/commit/f7c8279bc162c8c8b1964948d0f3b309ad715311 |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the default value (`false`) is consistent with the AS-IS ZSTD-JNI library's default buffer pool.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the updated

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to #31424, and proposes to use `UnresolvedTable.relationTypeMismatchHint` when `UnresolvedTable` is resolved to a temp view.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change utilizes the type mismatch hint when a relation is resolved to a temp view when a table is expected.\r\n\r\nFor example, `ALTER TABLE tmpView SET TBLPROPERTIES ('p' = 'an')` will now include `Please use ALTER VIEW instead.` in the exception message: `tmpView is a temp view. 'ALTER TABLE ... SET TBLPROPERTIES' expects a table. Please use ALTER VIEW instead.`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adds the hint in the exception message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to leverage `CustomMetric`, `CustomTaskMetric` API to report custom metrics from DS v2 scan to Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is related to #31398. In SPARK-34297, we want to add a couple of metrics when reading from Kafka in SS. We need some public API change in DS v2 to make it possible. This extracts only DS v2 change and make it general for DS v2 instead of micro-batch DS v2 API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nImplement a simple test DS v2 class locally and run it:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following metrics to track executor remove reasons during dynamic allocation:\r\n-  `numberExecutorsGracefullyDecommissioned`: number of executors which reached the finished decommissioning state and shut itself down cleanly\r\n- `numberExecutorsDecommissionUnfinished`: executors which requested to decommission but they stopped without reaching the finished decommissioning state \r\n- `numberExecutorsKilledByDriver`: executors killed by the driver (requested to stop)  \r\n-  `numberExecutorsExitedUnexpectedly`: executors exited without driver request\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor supporting monitoring of dynamic allocation better with these metrics.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The new metrics will be available for monitoring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith unit and integration tests.\r\n\r\nFinally manually checked the new metrics in jconsole:\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the UTs being added in SPARK-31793, so that all things contributing the length limit are properly accounted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test `DataSourceScanExecRedactionSuite.SPARK-31793: FileSourceScanExec metadata should contain limited file paths` is failing conditionally, depending on the length of the temp directory.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UTs explain the missing points, which also do the test.","created_at":"2021-02-03T04:45:12Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T00:55:06Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T23:46:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6448e9e74abbd5ab48accf970c1c8ad17ac68f6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31449/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31449/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31449/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6cd28914e2b582244f5121b9f307aa7987b1e23","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-34326-v2","ref":"SPARK-34326-v2","sha":"c6cd28914e2b582244f5121b9f307aa7987b1e23","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMany database support the function `to_number` to convert a string to number. \r\nThe implement of `to_number` has many different between `Postgresql` ,`Oracle` and `Phoenix`.\r\nSo, this PR follows the implement of `to_number` in `Oracle` that give a strict parameter verification.\r\nSo, this PR follows the implement of `to_number` in
