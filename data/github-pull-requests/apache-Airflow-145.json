-- allow option to encode or not encode UUID when uploading from Cassandra to GCS.\r\nAs discussed in issue [#22846](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22846), a new parameter 'encode_uuid' is added to allow user to choose not to encode UUID, while ensures backward compatibility.

turned out that deprecation of config values did not work as\r\nintended. While deprecation worked fine when the value was specified\r\nin configuration value it did not work when `run_as_user` was used.\r\n\r\nIn those cases the \"as_dict\" option was used to generate temporary\r\nconfiguratin and this temporary configuration contained default value\r\nfor the new configuration value - for example it caused that\r\nthe generated temporary value contained:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[database]\r\nsql_alchemy_conn=sqlite:///{AIRFLOW_HOME}/airflow.db\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if the deprecated `core/sql_alchemy_conn` was set (and no\r\nnew `database/sql_alchemy_conn` was set at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis effectively rendered the old installation that did not convert\r\nto the new \"database\" configuration not working for run_as_user, because\r\nthe tasks run with \"run_as_user\" used wrong, empty sqlite database\r\ninstaead of the one configured for Airflow.\r\n\r\nAlso during adding tests, it turned out that the mechanism was also\r\nnot working as intended before - in case `_CMD` or `_SECRET` were used\r\nas environment variables rather than configuration. In those cases\r\nboth _CMD and _SECRET should be evaluated during as_dict() evaluation,\r\nbecause the \"run_as_user\" might have not enough permission to run the\r\ncommand or retrieve secret. The _cmd and _secret variables were only\r\nevaluated during as_dict() when they were in the config file (note\r\nthat this only happens when include_cmd, include_env, include_secret\r\nare set to True).\r\n\r\nThe changes implemented in this PR fix both problems:\r\n\r\n* the _CMD and _SECRET env vars are evaluated during as_dict when the\r\n  respective include_* is set\r\n* the defaults are only set for the values that have deprecations\r\n  in case the deprecations have no values set in either of the ways:\r\n    * in config file\r\n    * in env variable\r\n    * in _cmd (via config file or env variable)\r\n    * in _secret (via config file or env variable)\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/23679\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This PR expands the \"stalled tasks\" functionality which is already in place for adopted tasks, and adds the ability to apply it to all tasks such that these lost/hung tasks can be automatically recovered and queued up again. \r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19699\r\n\r\nThis is an alternate approach/implementation of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/23432. There are a couple advantages to this approach:\r\n* It is lighter weight - instead of db queries happening on a periodic schedule, it's a simple date comparison happening on each loop\r\n* The code is cleaner - it's not a whole new piece of functionality, rather it's a slight expansion of an existing capability\r\n* Disabled by default - unless the user explicitly sets the `stalled_task_timeout` config setting, there is minimal behavioural change. The only behavioural difference is:\r\n  * in the existing code, stalled adopted tasks are not revoked from celery and they are marked as failed in airflow....which potentially results in:\r\n    * the task being executed multiple times (if it wasn't actually stalled, just in a long celery queue)\r\n    * failing with no error (if the task is set to `retries=0`)\r\n  * in this implementation, stalled adopted tasks are revoked from celery and are re-set to `SCHEDULED` state so they'll get queued back up.\r\n\r\ncc: @ephraimbuddy @kristoffern @kaxil @XD-DENG @ashb \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

#23411\r\n\r\nWhen checking the `ReadyToRescheduleDep` dependency, the `reschedule` property is checked (as explained in `UPDATING.md` in this commit:

`ti.task` is a `SerializedBaseOperator` object, not the original operator. So this serialized object doesn't have the `mode` or `reschedule` attributes, because they are not explicitly included when serializing.\r\n\r\nThe effect this had was that the sensor task was executed repeatedly, ignoring any other constraints (`poke_interval` for example). The scheduler would eventually fail the task, but this usually happened in a couple seconds.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-12T14:56:53Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T07:10:44Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T12:18:30Z","merged_at":"2022-05-17T12:18:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9e2a3051cd3a5b6fcf33bca4c929d220cf5661e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

scheduler_interval](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-39+Richer+scheduler_interval)\r\n- [Scoping out a new feature for 2.1: improving schedule_interval](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb4e004e68574e5fb77ee5b51f4fd5bfb4b3392d884c178bc767681bf%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E)\r\n- [[DISCUSS][AIP-39] Richer (and pluggable) schedule_interval on DAGs](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf8eeb06493681f48dc9e82ce605a9c3a930cfee0b4ca19462a4e55b3%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of [`CronDataIntervalTimetable`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2.2.5/airflow/timetables/interval.py#L116) is a little bit confusing - a DAG Run is triggered immediately after the DAG is enabled (unpaused), unlike normal cron's behavior.\r\n\r\nHence I'd like to add another cron timetable which does not care about \"data interval\" and which starts a DAG Run at the start of the period.\r\n\r\nI know even without this PR, each Airflow user can [customize DAG scheduling with Timetables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/timetable.html#). However, I assume this PR worth adding to the main repository so that the users can use the timetable easier.","created_at":"2022-05-12T04:14:03Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T21:51:10Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T23:25:04Z","merged_at":"2022-08-02T23:25:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0048414a6d3bdc282cc738af0185a9a1cd63ef8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

Problem\r\n\r\nYou have an external task which may \"skip\". When that happens, you want the external task sensor to also skip. This PR enables that behaviour.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThe \"right\" way to do this is:\r\n1. Set `failed_states` to `[State.SKIPPED]` (by default it is `None`)\r\n2. Set `soft_fail=True`\r\n\r\nWith the above settings, when the target task enters the SKIPPED state, the ExternalTaskSensor will see this as a failed state and immediately react to the failure. Because of the `soft_fail` flag, it should not mark as failed, but instead as skipped.\r\n\r\n# Effect of change\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, the `ExternalTaskSensor` ignored the `soft_fail` setting, and always marked it as an error. With this change in place, the `ExternalTaskSensor` will instead mark the task as skipped, as desired.\r\n\r\n# Other comments\r\n\r\n`soft_fail` would already kick in if the ExternalTaskSensors timed out (i.e. if the external task did not enter an allowed_state or failed_state in the time. That means a possible workaround for the above is to set a timeout on the ExternalTaskSensor which you believe is long enough that the external task should have completed.\r\n\r\nHowever (in my experience at least) ExternalTaskSensors are often run without timeouts. This is because if the target task hangs on upstream dependencies, having the external sensor timeout means cascading failures throughout the system which normally means more cleanup. It's usually easier to have the ExternalTaskSensors not timeout and thus only fail if there's an actual problem.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, soft_fail + execution timeouts is not perfect. If the task skips you may want the skip to propagate immediately; under the workaround, the skip would only kick in after the timeout. And of course, there are obvious goldilocks issues with finessing the timeout to be not too short nor too long.\r\n\r\n# Related Issues\r\n\r\ncloses: #19754

`logs` in the code) that could hang indefinitely with no new messages as the k8s logs api does not support log rotation.\r\n\r\nNow, `fetch_container_logs` will be interrupted if the container exits or if the logs consumption exits, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also added a tiny fix unrelated to this issue (I've marked it with a comment in the diff).
