situations, improving performance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6277\">#6277</a>)</li>\n<li>Optimistically perform stream and consumer snapshots on a normal shutdown (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6279\">#6279</a>)</li>\n<li>The stream snapshot interval has been removed, now relying on the compaction minimum, which improves performance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6289\">#6289</a>)</li>\n<li>Raft groups will no longer report current while they are paused with pending commits (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6317\">#6317</a>)</li>\n<li>Unnecessary client info fields have been removed from stream and consumer assignment proposals, API advisories and stream snapshot/restore advisories (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6326\">#6326</a>, <a

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6361\">#6361</a>)</li>\n<li>Healthchecks no longer re-evaluate stream and consumer assignments, avoiding some streams and consumers being unexpectedly recreated shortly after a deletion (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6362\">#6362</a>)</li>\n<li>Clients should no longer timeout on a retried ack with the <code>AckAll</code> policy after a server restart (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6392\">#6392</a>)</li>\n<li>Replicated consumers should no longer get stuck after leader changes due to incorrect accounting (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6387\">#6387</a>)</li>\n<li>Consumers will now correctly handle the case where messages queued for delivery have been removed, fixing a delivery slowdown (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6387\">#6387</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6399\">#6399</a>)</li>\n<li>The API in-flight metric has been fixed so that it does not drift after the queue has been dropped (<a

Setting it to <code>1</code> allows running on hosts that cannot load <code>br_netfilter</code>. Some things won't work, including disabling inter-container communication in a bridge network.

#33748\r\n\r\nThe tests has been failing consistently on Dataflow runner\r\n\r\nIt's likely due to spanner service change, e.g. attempt to read from a bad session will now create the session and make it valid on retry. The test still passed on Direct runner which does not retry.\r\n\r\nWe had excluded similar BigtableIO error handling tests flaky on Dataflow runner due to timing differences.\r\n\r\ninternal bug: 391864650\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

locking in some fixes and work to avoid making Triggers impossible to review. \r\nThis PR has 3 components.\r\n\r\n* Adds the bulk of the Trigger State Machine to be used in a different PR.\r\n  * Excludes handling Processing Time, and Merging Windows at this time.\r\n  * https://s.apache.org/beam-triggers for general handling. \r\n  * Checked understanding against the Java TriggerStateMachine code which supports execution for Java runners.\r\n  * Compressed the logic into less abstract form, and simplified shouldFire and Fire handling into a single isReady tree.\r\n  * While it's building on Prism's state handling, it is *not* getting serialized and deserialized all the time, saving some memory and processing. \r\n* Fixes a bug WRT state and timer execution: Bundles can't mix timers and data, since there is no ordering guarantee on their processing. Timers or data can be processed first. This is a problem if the other group has later data, avoiding the correctness issue.\r\n  * Fixed by never mixing Data and Timers in the same bundle. \r\n* Works around a legacy bug in Java's TestStream encodings where a value will be encoded with the deprecated \"Outer\" context, which leads to dropping length prefixes in the String encoder.\r\n  * This mostly allows additional ValidatesRunner tests to pass and execute, critical for Trigger testing.\r\n\r\nPart of #31438.\r\n\r\nActual use of the StateMachine will occur in a subsequent PR. Keeping the commented out debug prints for the time being. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

reverts commit 5bfacc935f8510bdf287d8c87b810e08ab9a79ae. The change caused the core SDK, the SDK harness, and the shared runners-core library to depend on Dataflow.\r\n\r\nBecause it depends only on the Dataflow cloud API it did not (quite/yet) introduce a cyclic dependency. We just need to correct it so that it doesn't bite us later, and to preserve Beam's overall architecture.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR Summary:\r\nThis PR addresses #21384 by adding comprehensive unit tests to the `sql` package, increasing the code coverage from 35% to 75%. The following test cases have been added:\r\n\r\n- **TestOutputType**: Tests output type handling with and without components.\r\n- **TestTransform**: Ensures proper validation of required options.\r\n- **TestMultipleOptions**: Verifies that multiple options can be applied correctly.\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\n- All tests pass locally.\r\n- Code coverage has increased from 35% to 75%.\r\n- Tests adhere to the existing codebase style and conventions.\r\n- Proper documentation and comments have been added for the test functions.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [x] Fixes #21384\r\n- [x] Tests added and passing locally\r\n- [ ] ICLA is signed (will sign if requested)\r\n- [ ] Updated `CHANGES.md`\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes:\r\n- The tests focus on configuration and option-setting functionality.\r\n- The `TestTransform` tests validate the required options without needing the expansion service.\r\n- Tests follow the established test patterns in the codebase.\r\n\r\n###

delta stringset metrics for streaming rather than cumulative. \r\nReporting cumulative was causing the following issues:\r\n- Every periodic (10 seconds) reports took cumulative over and over and reported it hence every report was reporting the metric. Unlike batch job reporting where it filters to only take one which has changed (tracked by dirty bit). \r\n- Not reseting was using more memory as metrics remained in memory forever\r\n- In backend it lead to large memory consumption when tracking active workitem counters which are also persisted for recovery leading to large growth in cns file sizes. \r\n\r\nTested that now we only see deltas\r\n\r\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/7W7R8Znv3mLgP8h\r\nhttps://screenshot.googleplex.com/6GMLuRMe9zKrAMV\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
