We use `lossSum/weightSum` as the mean loss in `LinearRegression`.\n2, We do not multiply the loss function and L2 regularization by 1/2. This is not a problem since it does not affect the result if we multiply the whole formula by a factor.\nSo should we turn to use the modified objective function like following which will be consistent with other Spark ML code?\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/17096260/50ab7ca4-520d-11e6-97ff-fd53fd88adf3.png)\n### Implement a new class RobustRegression or a new loss function for LinearRegression？\n\nBoth `LinearRegression` and `RobustRegression` accomplish the same goal, but the output of `fit` will be different: `LinearRegressionModel` and `RobustRegressionModel`. The former only contains `coefficients`, `intercept`; but the latter contains `coefficients`, `intercept`, `scale/sigma` (and even the outlier samples similar to sklearn `HuberRegressor.outliers_`). It will also involve save/load compatibility issue if we combine the two models become one. One trick method is we can drop `scale/sigma` and make the `fit` by this huber cost function still output `LinearRegressionModel`, but I don't think it's an appropriate way since it will miss some model attributes. So I implemented `RobustRegression` in a new class, and we can port this loss function to `LinearRegression` if needed at later time. \n### Bugs of breeze LBFGS-B and work around.\n\nThe estimated parameter `\\sigma` must > 0 which is a bound optimize problem and we should use `LBFGS-B` to solve, but there is a bug in breeze `LBFGS-B`. We figure out the work around with modified `LBFGS`. \nSince we known the huber loss function is convex in space `\\sigma > 0` and the bound `\\sigma = 0` is unreachable. The solution of loss function will not be on the bound. We still optimize the loss function by `LBFGS` but limit the step size when doing line search of each iteration. We should verify the step size generated by line search in the space `\\sigma > 0`.\nWe override the function `LBFGS.determineStepSize` to limit the step size. We should make sure that `\\sigma > 0` after take step operation: `x(k+1) = x(k) + alpha * dir` (`\\sigma` is the first element of parameter vector in my implementation). We use `BacktrackingLineSearch` to do line search since it can be set the upper bound of the returned step size. Meanwhile, `BacktrackingLineSearch` still checks the strong wolfe conditions.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-07-23T07:05:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T08:00:13Z","closed_at":"2017-08-22T07:33:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acc1524d9a5bae12eaedf9a31d12f86f7ee10b0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38831546496fb439844b0e8d084149ed482aaaff","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-3181","ref":"spark-3181","sha":"38831546496fb439844b0e8d084149ed482aaaff","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `JdbcUtils.savePartition` is doing type-based dispatch for each row to write appropriate values.\n\nSo, appropriate setters for `PreparedStatement` can be created first according to the schema, and then apply them to each row. This approach is similar with `CatalystWriteSupport`.\n\nThis PR simply make the setters to avoid this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-07-23T03:06:01Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T08:17:52Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T09:17:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a37a9d78bfb37ea3f8e8d6de66d02657e9dd509","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14323/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14323/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14323/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb0f9a8cd54cca299b2dac34d65848c2f86e7bb4","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16675","ref":"SPARK-16675","sha":"fb0f9a8cd54cca299b2dac34d65848c2f86e7bb4","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor partitioned file sources, the current implementation always scans all the partition columns. However, this is not necessary when the projected column list does not include any partition column. In addition, we also can avoid the unnecessary `Project`.\n\nBelow is an example,\n\n``` scala\nspark\n  .range(N)\n  .selectExpr(\"id AS value1\", \"id AS value2\", \"id AS p1\", \"id AS p2\", \"id AS p3\")\n  .toDF(\"value\", \"value2\", \"p1\", \"p2\", \"p3\").write.format(\"json\")\n  .partitionBy(\"p1\", \"p2\", \"p3\").save(tempDir)\n```\n\n```\nspark.read.format(\"json\").load(tempDir).selectExpr(\"value\")\n```\n\n**Before the PR changes**, the physical plan is like:\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\n*Project [value#37L]\n+- *Scan json [value#37L,p1#39,p2#40,p3#41] Format: JSON, InputPaths: file:/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-f7a4294a-2e1b-4f44-9ebb-1a5eb..., PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<value:bigint>\n```\n\n**After the PR changes**, the physical plan becomes:\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\n*Scan json [value#147L] Format: JSON, InputPaths: file:/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-a5bcb14a-46c2-4c20-8f34-9662b..., PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<value:bigint>\n```\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case to verify the results.\n","created_at":"2016-07-23T01:14:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T03:23:57Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T03:23:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be1a32768bb0a956c27476a460c42a1a7fc4e611","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14322/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14322/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14322/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1ff0465815f6adefb2b29c2973c9bc63aa13623","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:columnPruning","ref":"columnPruning","sha":"c1ff0465815f6adefb2b29c2973c9bc63aa13623","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds the ability to do stratified sampling in cross validation for ML pipelines. This is accomplished by modifying some of the methods in `StratifiedSamplingUtils` to support multiple _splits_ instead of a single subsample of the data. A method is added to `PairRDDFunctions` to support `randomSplitByKey`. Please see the detailed explanation below.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were added to `PairRDDFunctionsSuite`, `MLUtilsSuite`, `CrossValidatorSuite`, and `TrainValidationSuite`.\n## Algorithm changes\n\nCurrently, Spark implements a stratified sampling function on PairRDDs using the method `sampleByKeyExact` and `sampleByKey`. This method calls a stratified sampling routine that is implemented in `StratifiedSamplingUtils`. The underlying algorithm is described [here](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/meng13a.pdf) in the paper by Xiangrui Meng. When exact samples stratified samples are required, the algorithm makes an extra pass through the data. Each sample is mapped on to the interval [0, 1](for sampling without replacement), and we expect that, say for a 50% sample, we will split the interval at 0.5 and accept the samples which fell below that threshold. Items near 0 are highly likely to be accepted, while items near 1 are highly unlikely to be accepted. Items near 0.5 are uncertain, and are added to a waitlist on the first pass. The items in the waitlist will be sorted and used to determine the exact split point which produces 50/50 sample. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7275795/17071720/2f90bd14-5018-11e6-91c2-2c1dc2191213.png)\n\nThis patch modifies the routine to produce multiple splits by generating multiple waitlists on the first pass. Each waitlist is sorted to determine the exact split points and then we can sample as normal. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7275795/17071744/4f3b6d76-5018-11e6-8591-857eaaf288f9.png)\n\nOne potential concern is that if this is used for a large number of splits, it may degrade to the point where sorting the entire dataset would be quicker, as the waitlists get closer and closer together. It could potentially cause OOM errors on the driver if there are too many waitlists collected. Still, before this patch there was not a way to actually take a single _split_ of the data, as `sampleByKey` does not return the complement of the sample. This patch fixes this as well.\n## ML API\n\nThis patch also allows users to specify a stratified column in the `CrossValidator` and `TrainValidationSplit` estimators. This is done by converting the input dataframe to a PairRDD and calling the `randomSplitByKey` method. This is exposed via a `setStratifiedCol` parameter which, if set, will use _exact_ stratified splits for cross validation. \n## Future considerations\n\nThis can be implemented as a function on dataframes in the future, if there is interest. It is somewhat inconvient to convert the dataframe to a pair rdd, perform sampling, and then convert back to a dataframe.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd a Session Tab and the related Session Page in the Spark UI.\n\nThe page could show all properties configured for the session. It could be updated to the latest configuration after refreshing, compared to the SparkContext configurations showed in the Environments Page which cannot be updated during runtime.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested and viewed, and unit tests.\n\nWhen a `spark-shell` is opened, the Session page could be found at the related web UI (e.g. http://192.168.1.104:4040/session/), showing all the properties of the session.\n\nFirst input lines below into the shell, a new row about \"Property A\" could be found at the Session page after refreshing.\n\n``` scala\nimport

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**Issue 1: Disallow Creating/Altering a View when the same-name Table Exists (without IF NOT EXISTS)**\nWhen we create OR alter a view, we check whether the view already exists. In the current implementation, if a table with the same name exists, we treat it as a view. However, this is not the right behavior. We should follow what Hive does. For example,\n\n```\nhive> CREATE TABLE tab1 (id int);\nOK\nTime taken: 0.196 seconds\nhive> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW tab1 AS SELECT * FROM t1;\nFAILED: SemanticException [Error 10218]: Existing table is not a view\n The following is an existing table, not a view: default.tab1\nhive> ALTER VIEW tab1 AS SELECT * FROM t1;\nFAILED: SemanticException [Error 10218]: Existing table is not a view\n The following is an existing table, not a view: default.tab1\nhive> CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS tab1 AS SELECT * FROM t1;\nOK\nTime taken: 0.678 seconds\n```\n\n**Issue 2: Strange Error when Issuing Load Table Against A View**\nUsers should not be allowed to issue LOAD DATA against a view. Currently, when users doing it, we got a very strange runtime error. For example,\n\n``` SQL\nLOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH \"$testData\" INTO TABLE $viewName\n```\n\n```\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException was thrown.\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a straightforward clone of @JoshRosen 's original patch. I have follow-up changes to fix block replication for repl-defined classes as well, but those appear to be flaking tests so I'm going to leave that for SPARK-17042\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nEnd-to-end test in ReplSuite (also more tests in DistributedSuite from the original patch).\n","created_at":"2016-07-21T23:56:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T02:59:15Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T23:34:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0509238774906231a923ac79dc2dd33af5d8f54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ed8fb6e1e4fa9bd58ef1bfcc398e89b6fdf3bb8","head":{"label":"ericl:spark-16550","ref":"spark-16550","sha":"8ed8fb6e1e4fa9bd58ef1bfcc398e89b6fdf3bb8","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nImprove example outputs to better reflect the functionality that is being presented.  This mostly consisted of modifying what was printed at the end of the example, such as calling show() with truncate=False, but sometimes required minor tweaks in the example data to get relevant output.  Explicitly set parameters when they are used as part of the example.  Fixed Java examples that failed to run because of using old-style MLlib Vectors or problem with schema.  Synced examples between different APIs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan each example for Scala, Python, and Java and made sure output was legible on a terminal of width

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`CreateViewCommand` only needs some information of a `CatalogTable`, but not all of them. We have some tricks(e.g. we need to check the table type is `VIEW`, we need to make `CatalogColumn.dataType` nullable) to allow it to take a `CatalogTable`.\nThis PR cleans it up and only pass in necessary information to `CreateViewCommand`. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDefault `TreeNode.withNewChildren` implementation doesn't work for `Last` and when both constructor arguments are the same, e.g.:\n\n``` sql\nLAST_VALUE(FALSE) -- The 2nd argument defaults to FALSE\nLAST_VALUE(FALSE, FALSE)\nLAST_VALUE(TRUE, TRUE)\n```\n\nThis is because although `Last` is a unary expression, both of its constructor arguments, `child` and `ignoreNullsExpr`, are `Expression`s. When they have the same value, `TreeNode.withNewChildren` treats both of them as child nodes by mistake. `First` is also affected by this issue in exactly the same way.\n\nThis PR fixes this issue by making `ignoreNullsExpr` a child expression of `First` and `Last`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test case added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR makes `LEAST` and `GREATEST` accept other numeric types (`Decimal`). This worked fine in `HiveContext` in 1.6 because , for example, `1.5` was `DoubleType` in there.\n\nSo, this finds a tightest common type from both `IntegerType` and `DoubleType` as `DoubleType`, then it works okay.\n\nBut currently it seems `1.5` is being treated as `DecimalType` for now. So, It casts 1.5 as decimal(2, 1). So, it fails to find a tightest common type from both `IntegerType` and `DecimalType(2, 1)`.\n\nThis PR introduces new function `findTightestCommonTypeToDecimal` dealing with decimals interacting with each other or with primitive types. This logic is borrowed from JSON schema inference.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `TypeCoercionSuite` and `DataFrameFunctionsSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-07-21T02:23:56Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:02Z","closed_at":"2016-07-29T03:22:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21ac031308438cf90314a96f9239f806c6d3b3ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14294/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14294/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14294/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/abbcb4e9884c7aafcb0705a7b9d0b80988d8a8c7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16646","ref":"SPARK-16646","sha":"abbcb4e9884c7aafcb0705a7b9d0b80988d8a8c7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent fix for deadlock disables interrupts in the StreamExecution which getting offsets for all sources, and when writing to any metadata log, to avoid potential deadlocks in HDFSMetadataLog(see JIRA for more details). However, disabling interrupts can have unintended consequences in other sources. So I am making the fix more narrow, by disabling interrupt it only in the HDFSMetadataLog. This is a narrower fix for something risky like disabling interrupt.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR contains three changes. \n\nFirst, this PR changes the behavior of lead/lag back to Spark 1.6's behavior, which is described as below:\n1. lead/lag respect null input values, which means that if the offset row exists and the input value is null, the result will be null instead of the default value.\n2. If the offset row does not exist, the default value will be used.\n3. OffsetWindowFunction's nullable setting also considers the nullability of its input (because of the first change).\n\nSecond, this PR fixes the evaluation of lead/lag when the input expression is a literal. This fix is a result of the first change. In current master, if a literal is used as the input expression of a lead or lag function, the result will be this literal even if the offset row does not exist.\n\nThird, this PR makes ResolveWindowFrame not fire if a window function is not resolved.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew tests in SQLWindowFunctionSuite\n","created_at":"2016-07-20T08:57:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T05:56:26Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T04:00:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45f7d6d08118c4d52eab7a123fb4e44b94779cb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff3029e3db2214d7c51ea3ea866becf441fddac4","head":{"label":"yhuai:lead-lag","ref":"lead-lag","sha":"ff3029e3db2214d7c51ea3ea866becf441fddac4","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"75146be6ba5e9f559f5f15430310bb476ee0812c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe will convert Metastore Orc tables (represented by `MetastoreRelation`) to datasource tables (represented by `HadoopFsRelation`) if `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreOrc` is enabled for better performance.\n\nHowever, due to a Hive issue, an Orc table created by Hive does not store column name correctly in the Orc files. For these Orc tables, we can't do the conversion.\n\nThis PR tries to compare the inferred schema of Orc files with Metastore schema. If they don't match, we skip the conversion and continue to use `MetastoreRelation`.\n\nAs Parquet will have similar conversion, this PR does the same checking for it too.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n","created_at":"2016-07-20T08:41:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:47Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T07:06:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db314919acb222dc14bd5203150f8e755673267b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90444a22e319c9c4f78cf87f1b82a825d9675e22","head":{"label":"viirya:detect-schema-when-convert-relation","ref":"detect-schema-when-convert-relation","sha":"90444a22e319c9c4f78cf87f1b82a825d9675e22","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n### Default - ISO 8601\n\nCurrently, CSV datasource is writing `Timestamp` and `Date` as numeric form and JSON datasource is writing both as below:\n- CSV\n  \n  ```\n  // TimestampType\n  1414459800000000\n  // DateType\n  16673\n  ```\n- Json\n  \n  ```\n  // TimestampType\n  1970-01-01 11:46:40.0\n  // DateType\n  1970-01-01\n  ```\n\nSo, for CSV we can't read back what we write and for JSON it becomes ambiguous because the timezone is being missed. \n\nSo, this PR make both **write** `Timestamp` and `Date` in ISO 8601 formatted string (please refer the [ISO 8601 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)).\n- For `Timestamp` it becomes as below: (`yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ`)\n  \n  ```\n  1970-01-01T02:00:01.000-01:00\n  ```\n- For `Date` it becomes as below (`yyyy-MM-dd`)\n  \n  ```\n  1970-01-01\n  ```\n### Custom date format option - `dateFormat`\n\nThis PR also adds the support to write and read dates and timestamps in a formatted string as below:\n- **DateType**\n  - With `dateFormat` option (e.g. `yyyy/MM/dd`)\n    \n    ```\n    +----------+\n    |      date|\n    +----------+\n    |2015/08/26|\n    |2014/10/27|\n    |2016/01/28|\n    +----------+\n    ```\n### Custom date format option - `timestampFormat`\n- **TimestampType**\n  - With `dateFormat` option (e.g. `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`)\n    \n    ```\n    +----------------+\n    |            date|\n    +----------------+\n    |2015/08/26 18:00|\n    |2014/10/27 18:30|\n    |2016/01/28 20:00|\n    +----------------+\n    ```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were added in `CSVSuite` and `JsonSuite`. For JSON, existing tests cover the default

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase`, which is used by the vectorized Parquet reader, we convert the Parquet requested schema into a Spark schema to guide column reader initialization. However, the Parquet requested schema is tailored from the schema of the physical file being scanned, and may have inaccurate type information due to bugs of other systems (e.g. HIVE-14294).\n\nOn the other hand, we already set the real Spark requested schema into Hadoop configuration in [`ParquetFileFormat`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.0.0-rc5/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetFileFormat.scala#L292-L294). This PR simply reads out this schema to replace the converted one.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test case added in `ParquetQuerySuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-07-20T06:52:15Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T11:04:11Z","closed_at":"2016-07-21T09:17:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca4b19fac887109fd682522e724ba198b3e74359","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d532e5ee9ba81259222074eb795f271a5fb11a0c","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-16632-simpler-fix","ref":"spark-16632-simpler-fix","sha":"d532e5ee9ba81259222074eb795f271a5fb11a0c","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBuilds upon the work done by @hhbyyh in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/7871 . This replaces all occurrences of TimeTracker with the more useful MultiStopWatch. More useful because it is possible to bench the total time across the worker nodes as well, for instance in the method `binsToBestSplit` using the `DistributedStopwatch`. It is also very useful to measure the optimizations in terms of time done in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13959 and should be merged before that gets reviewed. It also removes the `TimeTracker` since it is not being used elsewhere except the tree module.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nIt was run using `setLogLevel(\"INFO\")` and the following timings are printed out.\n\n16/07/19 16:45:18 INFO RandomForest: {\n  binsToBestSplit: 26ms,\n  chooseSplits: 301ms,\n  findBestSplits: 307ms,\n  findSplitsBins: 553ms,\n  init: 1229ms,\n  total:

Hive (or at least certain versions of Hive) creates parquet files\ncontaining tinyint or smallint columns, it stores them as int32, but\ndoesn't annotate the parquet field as containing the corresponding\nint8 / int16 data. When Spark reads those files using the vectorized\nreader, it follows the parquet schema for these fields, but when\nactually reading the data it tries to use the type fetched from\nthe metastore, and then fails because data has been loaded into the\nwrong fields in OnHeapColumnVector.\n\nSo instead of blindly trusting the parquet schema, check whether the\nCatalyst-provided schema disagrees with it, and adjust the types so\nthat the necessary metadata is present when loading the data into\nthe ColumnVector instance.\n\nTested with unit tests and with tests that create byte / short columns\nin Hive and try to read them from Spark.\n","created_at":"2016-07-19T23:36:23Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T18:34:30Z","closed_at":"2016-07-20T05:02:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3ece73f11c80f464fbac3729491a2ca7ab52877","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d853ba0769189b0557d801b9e3e1ed1a9d65cea9","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-16632","ref":"SPARK-16632","sha":"d853ba0769189b0557d801b9e3e1ed1a9d65cea9","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdding a new property to SparkConf called spark.metrics.namespace that allows users to\nset a custom namespace for executor and driver metrics in the metrics systems.\n\nBy default, the root namespace used for driver or executor metrics is\nthe value of `spark.app.id`. However, often times, users want to be able to track the metrics\nacross apps for driver and executor metrics, which is hard to do with application ID\n(i.e. `spark.app.id`) since it changes with every invocation of the app. For such use cases,\nusers can set the `spark.metrics.namespace` property to another spark configuration key like\n`spark.app.name` which is then used to populate the root namespace of the metrics system\n(with the app name in our example). `spark.metrics.namespace` property can be set to any\narbitrary spark property key, whose value would be used to set the root namespace of the\nmetrics system. Non driver and executor metrics are never prefixed with `spark.app.id`, nor\ndoes the `spark.metrics.namespace` property have any such affect on such metrics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests, modified existing unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-07-19T19:47:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T13:09:32Z","closed_at":"2016-07-27T17:15:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd77b9fe312519b94b23260cfbc80abaff35bed3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8923c58d324b8083ffb423d165f4707ec4395db2","head":{"label":"markgrover:spark-5847","ref":"spark-5847","sha":"8923c58d324b8083ffb423d165f4707ec4395db2","user":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17418333,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQxODMzMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"markgrover/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd an install_spark function to the SparkR package. User can run `install_spark()` to install Spark to a local directory within R. \n\nUpdates:\n\nSeveral changes have been made:\n- `install.spark()`\n  - check existence of tar file in the cache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently `RDD.pipe(command: String)`:\n- works only when the command is specified without any options, such as `RDD.pipe(\"wc\")`\n- does NOT work when the command is specified with some options, such as `RDD.pipe(\"wc -l\")`\n\nThis is a regression from Spark 1.6.\n\nThis patch adds back the tokenization process in `RDD.pipe(command: String)` to fix this regression.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test which:\n- would pass in `1.6`\n- _[prior to this patch]_ would fail in `master`\n- _[after this patch]_ would pass in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`Nvl` function should support numeric-straing cases like Hive/Spark1.6. Currently, `Nvl` finds the tightest common types among numeric types. This PR extends that to consider `String` type, too.\n\n``` scala\n- TypeCoercion.findTightestCommonTypeOfTwo(left.dataType, right.dataType).map { dtype =>\n+ TypeCoercion.findTightestCommonTypeToString(left.dataType, right.dataType).map { dtype =>\n```\n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"select nvl('0', 1)\").collect()\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve `nvl(\"0\", 1)` due to data type mismatch:\ninput to function coalesce should all be the same type, but it's [string, int]; line

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn ScriptInputOutputSchema, we read default RecordReader and RecordWriter from conf. Since Spark 2.0 has deleted those config keys from hive conf, we have to set default reader/writer class name by ourselves. Otherwise we will get None for LazySimpleSerde, the data written would not be able to read by script. The test case added worked fine with previous version of Spark, but would fail now.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadded a test case in SQLQuerySuite.\n\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPartition discovery is rather expensive, so we should do it at execution time instead of during physical planning. Right now there is not much benefit since ListingFileCatalog will read scan for all partitions at planning time anyways, but this can be optimized in the future. Also, there might be more information for partition pruning not available at planning time.\n\nThis PR moves a lot of the file scan logic from planning to execution time. All file scan operations are handled by `FileSourceScanExec`, which handles both batched and non-batched file scans. This requires some duplication with `RowDataSourceScanExec`, but is probably worth it so that `FileSourceScanExec` does not need to depend on an input RDD.\n\nTODO: In another pr, move DataSourceScanExec to it's own file.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests (it might be worth adding a test that catalog.listFiles() is delayed until execution, but this can be delayed until there is an actual benefit to doing so).\n","created_at":"2016-07-17T22:20:14Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T18:21:55Z","closed_at":"2016-08-03T18:21:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c13347d2a9d0e16a6c22f4016a03ebb6d973a826","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/704511ebacd8438c52d7e6e9488db86dc481f7fc","head":{"label":"ericl:refactor","ref":"refactor","sha":"704511ebacd8438c52d7e6e9488db86dc481f7fc","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded a pre-fetch mechanism for shuffle stage.\nThe map stage would load the blocks before the openBlock message arrives, then while the block data were transferred through the net, disks would no longer has nothing to do,  they would provide the data and let the server load to memory.\n This would make the time between the server received  openBlock message and ready to transfer the data even shorter.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAfter setting the params:`spark.shuffle.prepare.count` > 0 & `spark.shuffle.prepare.open` to be `true`, this mechanism will

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improves `LogicalPlanToSQLSuite` to check the generated SQL directly by **structure**. So far, `LogicalPlanToSQLSuite` relies on  `checkHiveQl` to ensure the **successful SQL generation** and **answer equality**. However, it does not guarantee the generated SQL is the same or will not be changed unnoticeably.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins. This is only a testsuite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFollowing JIRA 16490 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16490), I added a python example for the chi sq selector in mllib. This one was missing while Java and Scala version were already supported.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nStyle checks were run. Did some manual tests to see if the outcome was as expected. Given this is an example and is very similar to the Java and Scala  examples, there is no need to write any automated tests (none are  implemented for any the examples)\n","created_at":"2016-07-16T15:11:49Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T23:04:42Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T23:04:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58c23e5b66a5b5ee4653fb5fb1c4f1d73e63cd99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4816c2ef5e04eb2dd70bed8b99882aa0b7fe7fd7","head":{"label":"setjet:master","ref":"master","sha":"4816c2ef5e04eb2dd70bed8b99882aa0b7fe7fd7","user":{"login":"setjet","id":1176161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzYxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1176161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet","html_url":"https://github.com/setjet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63481050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzQ4MTA1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"setjet/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"setjet","id":1176161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzYxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1176161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet","html_url":"https://github.com/setjet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/setjet/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, column pruning in `InMemoryTableScanExec` only can utilize the predicates whose either left or right side is foldable expressions. We can further extend the existing framework to utilize the predicates in which both sides are attribute references. Through their maximal and minimal boundary values, we can prune the unnecessary partitions. The performance improvement depends on the data distribution and predicates. \n\nTODO: more examples here.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nTODO: added more test cases\n","created_at":"2016-07-16T01:22:32Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T03:23:37Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T03:23:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d02eaf31bca77f696faff736a274884a0e2d754d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/143f5cda2fd0e48ae60095e6a236f8eb4a31c6a5","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:inMemory","ref":"inMemory","sha":"143f5cda2fd0e48ae60095e6a236f8eb4a31c6a5","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror
