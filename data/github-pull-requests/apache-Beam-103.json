`put` on bounded blocking queues is a rather bad practice as it blocks for an unlimited period of time if the capacity is exhausted. Especially when using KPL aggregated records this can easily happen. As a results threads need to be interrupted when forcefully shutting down the reader pool.\r\n\r\nThis seems to mostly be an issue when using the direct runner as it frequently closes the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

up from: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16080#issuecomment-990888132\r\n\r\nBeam can run with different versions of avro at runtime. However, some fixes from avro 1.9 are not visible due to beam internals\r\n\r\n* [AVRO-1891](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1891) is fixed by adding the conversion at compile time in the generated class' model. Beam does not currently read the `SpecificData` form the class.\r\n* [BEAM-8329](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8329) ReflectData is not supposed to use the logical conversions by default. Users should either use a `CustomEncoding` with the `AvroEncode` annotation or manually add the conversion to their own `ReflectData` which is not possible everywhere in beam.\r\n* [BEAM-9144](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9144) is a 'snowflake'. All other joda logical time conversions are still failing. (`date`, `time-millis`, `time-micros`, `timestampt-micros`). This should not be in the framework but in the user code\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to\r\n* Keep both avro 1.8 and 1.9 support\r\n* Use proper logical type conversions when using avro 1.9 specific data (`useReflectApi` must be disabled)\r\n* Give users the possibility to provide their own avro data in the `DatumWriterFactory` and `DatumReaderFactory` used by beam internals\r\n\r\nNeeds discussion:\r\n* `AvroCoder` should have constructor with `DatumWriterFactory` and `DatumReaderFactory` but this causes a serialization issue with the [`AvroCoderCloudObjectTranslator`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/google-cloud-dataflow-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/dataflow/util/AvroCoderCloudObjectTranslator.java) whenre the object needs to be converted into a json form.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

preparation for upgrading to errorprone 2.11.0 when it comes out, I went ahead and made the jump from 2.3.4 -> 2.10.0 so we can go ahead and address those issues.\r\n\r\nThis exposed an issue in the new ArgumentSelectionDefectChecker (https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/2745). I was able to resolve this for some projects by bumping autoservice to 1.0.1 (from 1.0-rc6), but a few projects that have transitive dependencies on old guava versions still run into the issue, so I disabled the check for now.\r\n\r\nFor most of the remaining new checks I've just disabled them (56af3f1d5d7dec51a9ad54ead06677a7f704c679). Others I've gone ahead and addressed. I tried to split out the trivial  changes (d5f9a05cbb8594971d7819e348df1589d9b6eee1) from those that are more involved and may require more scrutiny (5de18c7d454c26ad523580b0b14a041b1946a813).\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n

adds support for caching artifacts across job runs to the python dataflow runner.  The method it uses is slightly different than the JVM uses to work around some limitations to the python container boot code.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Certain artifacts must have a specific name (dataflow_python_sdk.tar, pipeline.pb, etc)\r\n- All artifacts for a job must be in the same \"directory\" on GCS\r\n\r\nTo work around this, we stage artifacts in a two step process now (gated by a pipeline flag, default value TBD?):\r\n- First upload the artifact to a common cache location (`artifact_cache`) directly under the staging directory.  In this location the artifact is named using its sha256 hash.  If the file already exists, this step is skipped (which is the slowest step)\r\n- Once uploaded (either because it was a cache hit, or just uploaded), perform a GCS copy operation to \"copy\" the file from its cached location into where it should be in the job's unique staging directory.  This operation is fast since its a GCS->GCS copy in the same bucket.\r\n\r\nIdeally we wouldn't need these workarounds, but this works well for now.  If the boot code is ever enhanced to fix the above two issues, it'd be easy to change this to use a new caching method.\r\n\r\nJust choosing some reviewers based on who's last changed code here:\r\n\r\nR: @ihji @tvalentyn \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
