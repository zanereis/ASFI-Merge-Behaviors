PR added the sdf self-checkpoint support to portable Flink by using timer and state where\r\n\r\n- In batch, we use `InMemoryTimerInternals` and `InMemoryStateInternals` to set the timer and persist residual elements.\r\n\r\n- In streaming, we use `SdfFlinkTimerInternals` as the wrapper of `FlinkTimerInternals` and `SdfFlinkStateInternals` as the wrapper of `FlinkStateInternals` for one specific

`pipeline_from_stages()`, only the transforms and their subtransforms that are included in the given stages are copied over to the output pipeline proto. This change similarly only copies over only PCollections that are produced by those transforms to the output pipeline proto. This prevents PCollections whose producers have been eliminated by optimization phases from being copied to the output pipeline proto, which would later cause an error in `Pipeline.from_runner_api()`.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the reverted pull request #13014 which broke `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized` tests. The tests have been fixed by passing `executable_stage_transform()` the components from the original proto, rather than the modified proto.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

updated elasticsearch dependencies to the recent 7.9.2.\r\n\r\nThe change required some changes in tests - now it's impossible to use embedded elasticsearch node, but testcontainers appeared to be even faster - from the previous ~8s to ~5s on my local machine.\r\n\r\nIn another PR I use testcontainers to run HadoopFormatIOElasticIT on jenkins in Java PostCommit. It can be found here: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13085\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Go SDF splitting and execution code so that splits take exploded windows into consideration and perform splits at window boundaries. Also required adjusting various split logic to accept multiple residuals and primaries from splits.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the splitting logic itself are in exec/sdf.go, and the tests are in the corresponding test file. The rest of the changes are mostly related to adjusting other code to handle the change from single primaries and restrictions to multiple primaries and restrictions, or just small bugfixes (like offsetrange.RTracker.GetProgress).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

some reason, `convertRequiredField` used in `BigQueryAvroUtils.convertGenericRecordToTableRow` casts values with the Avro `INTEGER` type to `Long`, but then converts them to `String` objects via `toString`.\r\n\r\nI'm quite unsure where `convertGenericRecordToTableRow` is used elsewhere, but we use it to utilize BigQuery's Storage API reads.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly certain this is not expected behaviour because other types are converted properly and due to the cast to `Long` it's ensured that any values will fit into `Long` objects anyways.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you

built this change on top of https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13042 and confirmed that the direct runner's `ValidatesRunner` still passed. I confirmed with `grep -r CreatePCollectionView runners/direct-java` that there are no more mentions in the direct runner.\r\n\r\nSummary of how the change works:\r\n\r\n - For all the `ParDo.MultiOutput` primitives, attach a `WriteView` direct runner step to each side input. This has the same behavior as today but does not depend on having a `CreatePCollectionView` primitive in the SDK graph.\r\n - Since `CreatePCollectionView` is still in the graph and it is not that easy to delete, just attach a noop evaluation. When `CreatePCollectionView` is deleted soon, this can be removed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`CreatePCollectionView` transform is not part of Beam's portable protocol, so it is deprecated. Many (all?) runners depend on this transform being present in the graph to translate side inputs for `ParDo`. This PR removes that from the SDK's graph, forcing runners to translate without it.\r\n\r\nI am tackling this a little bit at a time, cherry-picking in this change to drive various adjustments to runners and potentially utilities in runners core construction.\r\n\r\nOnce each runner does not require this transform, the `beam_fn_api` experiment can be resolved and the expansion can be just the portable expansion.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

were two problems:\r\n\r\n1. My gradle script did not fail when the job service failed to start up. I fixed that and confirmed.\r\n2. The target for the various port/pid/stdout/stderr files were in the gradle output dir but it may not exist.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both.\r\n\r\nFor the second one, I modified the local job service to create the needed directories. I'm not sure if there is a preference here. The gradle script could also create the needed directory, but I think this change is probably more helpful overall.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.\r\n\r\nRelated PR in Apache Airflow: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11319\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

There could be some race condition on Jenkins that tests might be\r\n   running in parallel on the same machine sharing the same global variable.\r\n   In that case, a test's SetUp cannot guarantee the global variable is\r\n   not changed during test execution.

runners expect transform nodes in a pipeline to be placed in topological order. This change makes`eliminate_common_key_with_void` and `pack_combiners` return stages in topological order so that the resulting pipeline from `Pipeline.from_runner_api` will have transforms in topological order. It also introduces a generic stage-packing framework that is used for implementing `eliminate_common_key_with_void` and `pack_combiners`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

`pipeline_from_stages()`, only the transforms and their subtransforms that are included in the given stages are copied over to the output pipeline proto. This change similarly only copies over only PCollections that are produced by those transforms to the output pipeline proto. This prevents PCollections whose producers have been eliminated by optimization phases from being copied to the output pipeline proto, which would later cause an error in `Pipeline.from_runner_api()`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
