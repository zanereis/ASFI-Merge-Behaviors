incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-11T03:21:13Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T09:32:56Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T09:32:56Z","merged_at":"2023-01-12T09:32:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a5680b559e73b461bda4b1b07586c0e06357391","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/66","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/66","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/66/labels","id":8789264,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ahh0Q","number":66,"title":"3.1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":6,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:06Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T04:32:24Z","due_on":"2023-01-21T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T04:32:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e811d73efbf178eba46c1caff61e35b541b49f33","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/countdown","ref":"fix/countdown","sha":"e811d73efbf178eba46c1caff61e35b541b49f33","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-10T13:09:01Z","updated_at":"2023-01-15T13:23:26Z","closed_at":"2023-01-15T13:23:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10c3f73bcc6941e6868ba02347a541a6976acc8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e2c60a67c03590e8cb3031b08134dc1621be95a7","head":{"label":"MentosL:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"e2c60a67c03590e8cb3031b08134dc1621be95a7","user":{"login":"MentosL","id":33775732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzc1NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33775732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL","html_url":"https://github.com/MentosL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MentosL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"af55fc87e811e7027166a188f8773c56715b274c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-10T03:34:24Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T02:47:37Z","closed_at":"2023-01-11T02:47:37Z","merged_at":"2023-01-11T02:47:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"213363422e0981b1f227af61a01876b8adcadfda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/81cbe7ba671ea2fc4aa9503101f066e3af436415","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0110_mapping","ref":"0110_mapping","sha":"81cbe7ba671ea2fc4aa9503101f066e3af436415","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe used Maven version and Maven Wrapper version are out of date.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Bumping Maven version to 3.8.7\r\n- Using the latest distribution of the Maven Wrapper\r\n\r\nAll of these changes were made using the recommended way with the following command:\r\n`mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.8.7`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nJust via CI\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-09T20:56:29Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T02:16:57Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T02:16:57Z","merged_at":"2023-01-12T02:16:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"efb83f828540c87ce48b784c2b583aa637ced5e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/305d1832a51c19af17daf0f61e541e2895af6364","head":{"label":"sconvent:mvn-wrapper-upgrade","ref":"mvn-wrapper-upgrade","sha":"305d1832a51c19af17daf0f61e541e2895af6364","user":{"login":"sconvent","id":7905559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDU1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7905559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent","html_url":"https://github.com/sconvent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":587045145,"node_id":"R_kgDOIv2ZGQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sconvent/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sconvent","id":7905559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDU1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7905559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent","html_url":"https://github.com/sconvent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sconvent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sconvent/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-09T03:21:46Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T12:02:30Z","closed_at":"2023-01-09T12:02:29Z","merged_at":"2023-01-09T12:02:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8e6dfa42a22e9c21697ad37709abec7ae33895b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b837ef42691397e9588ed8f56003721c4c9070ab","head":{"label":"LXPWing:3.2_read_code","ref":"3.2_read_code","sha":"b837ef42691397e9588ed8f56003721c4c9070ab","user":{"login":"LXPWing","id":65880844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODgwODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65880844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing","html_url":"https://github.com/LXPWing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":393930918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTM5MzA5MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LXPWing/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LXPWing","id":65880844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODgwODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65880844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing","html_url":"https://github.com/LXPWing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LXPWing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LXPWing/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-05T06:15:53Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T08:46:22Z","closed_at":"2023-01-06T08:36:59Z","merged_at":"2023-01-06T08:36:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a1aa856ab5ac2a4e80a5646c5b2d78a59d66116","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/66","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/66","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/66/labels","id":8789264,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ahh0Q","number":66,"title":"3.1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":6,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:06Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T04:32:24Z","due_on":"2023-01-21T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T04:32:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/34c48ee33f9d7dc7da9186cefcd8ce78fa4efd45","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0105_old_revision","ref":"0105_old_revision","sha":"34c48ee33f9d7dc7da9186cefcd8ce78fa4efd45","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

(usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-05T04:02:23Z","updated_at":"2023-06-04T03:48:16Z","closed_at":"2023-06-04T03:48:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6adb3ad27c002e81a0826cb31cacab56326940ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9764fb4a32f6300e75020b9eb94877d37bb0a89a","head":{"label":"YczYanchengzhe:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"9764fb4a32f6300e75020b9eb94877d37bb0a89a","user":{"login":"YczYanchengzhe","id":45945752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTQ1NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45945752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe","html_url":"https://github.com/YczYanchengzhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YczYanchengzhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"ad79c9e8fdf40e96cd6bf470991d445592049471","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-30T09:49:54Z","updated_at":"2022-12-30T12:34:44Z","closed_at":"2022-12-30T12:34:44Z","merged_at":"2022-12-30T12:34:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"73969703b1f4407fce837de1816106eb53f7f03b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/11132efbe8b07640c891131bab5fb3b8f4ee2242","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1230_add_qos_log","ref":"1230_add_qos_log","sha":"11132efbe8b07640c891131bab5fb3b8f4ee2242","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-28T12:08:40Z","updated_at":"2022-12-31T05:41:32Z","closed_at":"2022-12-31T05:41:32Z","merged_at":"2022-12-31T05:41:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"2765deb98d11e58788f629aa3b6237e790c0a0d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b3302855ffc3ac9dd6b8c0e2f3fa2d835eb6ceb2","head":{"label":"EarthChen:fix-tri-upper-header","ref":"fix-tri-upper-header","sha":"b3302855ffc3ac9dd6b8c0e2f3fa2d835eb6ceb2","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"f03f374397b9710d16c9d5fd3842ab06cbd944ce","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-26T10:41:10Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T05:55:42Z","closed_at":"2022-12-26T12:36:24Z","merged_at":"2022-12-26T12:36:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"58131051c32e504d32c7bd0233b84a7071eb2031","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0c724c68fa0eb542b4f3e2ffe7b8cc1de5ac38bf","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1226_active","ref":"1226_active","sha":"0c724c68fa0eb542b4f3e2ffe7b8cc1de5ac38bf","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-26T03:07:59Z","updated_at":"2022-12-26T06:47:23Z","closed_at":"2022-12-26T06:47:23Z","merged_at":"2022-12-26T06:47:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"a7592e3bea848b3f8dfebeb8b51e827af813ec9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/120d80d6e13125e424d92081f35b108d811d000a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1226_fix_port","ref":"1226_fix_port","sha":"120d80d6e13125e424d92081f35b108d811d000a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-22T10:13:18Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T10:01:04Z","closed_at":"2022-12-25T13:17:20Z","merged_at":"2022-12-25T13:17:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"98c2f39090a02c80be4a1e8d7cad94390b62d14b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11194/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11194/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11194/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/83044e7918731f57c7d71cd72fc0367543aebe8b","head":{"label":"wuwen5:11193-deadlock","ref":"11193-deadlock","sha":"83044e7918731f57c7d71cd72fc0367543aebe8b","user":{"login":"wuwen5","id":5037807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5037807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":12370433,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM3MDQzMw==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wuwen5/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuwen5","id":5037807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzc4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5037807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuwen5/dubbo","description":"(3.1.x

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-21T03:44:04Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T06:32:46Z","closed_at":"2022-12-21T06:32:42Z","merged_at":"2022-12-21T06:32:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"6967ab4a9bead820c5962c389128f45543bc99cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f2bdf56fd01733e6d7b0c87d2cd7683c022c905e","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/native_jdk17","ref":"fix/native_jdk17","sha":"f2bdf56fd01733e6d7b0c87d2cd7683c022c905e","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-20T15:04:09Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T15:29:43Z","closed_at":"2022-12-21T15:29:42Z","merged_at":"2022-12-21T15:29:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb05764dd35dbd8e289404363ff1ad3d331d7cd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7b6b7049eee4fd093524635c64081e1c35769476","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1220_fix_cl","ref":"1220_fix_cl","sha":"7b6b7049eee4fd093524635c64081e1c35769476","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-15T12:48:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T10:13:16Z","closed_at":"2022-12-30T08:27:16Z","merged_at":"2022-12-30T08:27:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"854d85953d6421d19fa3e4bfc288d3f3a154010a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f1fb66d583b0a6718fada37639448d5c1be6d343","head":{"label":"ShenFeng312:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"f1fb66d583b0a6718fada37639448d5c1be6d343","user":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"f5df7edcdfbe3eed21e34700d7dc42e1bf925fa2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-15T02:52:00Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T04:35:58Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T02:52:07Z","merged_at":"2022-12-15T02:52:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e28d53024039e1b65a360a99aa6abe3dd0b6272","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c5b971dfb718b1f23c0439ab0549b4b094ddb418","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1215_fix_tests","ref":"1215_fix_tests","sha":"c5b971dfb718b1f23c0439ab0549b4b094ddb418","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-15T02:47:11Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T04:36:05Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T03:12:14Z","merged_at":"2022-12-15T03:12:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a540222c58941578c418f44d86366e6193f94a38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/65","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/65","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/65/labels","id":8704553,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AhNIp","number":65,"title":"3.1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T02:54:22Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:16Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f9127446de7f64f2289488cb48a6b0bc8e5c873a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1215_fix_zk","ref":"1215_fix_zk","sha":"f9127446de7f64f2289488cb48a6b0bc8e5c873a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-14T08:23:52Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T09:03:56Z","closed_at":"2022-12-14T08:23:59Z","merged_at":"2022-12-14T08:23:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba3680544cc7b2e3b6c9150344d6479527ebb535","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/964e223b634c100a6294f15a11346e86fc22dc59","head":{"label":"apache:1214_update_fj2","ref":"1214_update_fj2","sha":"964e223b634c100a6294f15a11346e86fc22dc59","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-10T08:04:38Z","updated_at":"2022-12-11T01:26:09Z","closed_at":"2022-12-11T01:26:09Z","merged_at":"2022-12-11T01:26:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"20a4444fbe601d3c6022102aa2b69291976a7c84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11112/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11112/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11112/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3da5ee51411e07bddf08bf659fa9016c93d36916","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1210_fix_model","ref":"1210_fix_model","sha":"3da5ee51411e07bddf08bf659fa9016c93d36916","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nProvides a custom extension for service not found.\r\nIssue Number: close #10950 \r\nrebase of #11060 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThe spi extension ExceptionProcessor is provided to allow custom exception handling when an exception occurs during the decode phase. At the same time, it provides an all-round generalization of the server, which can accept any interface, thereby providing enhanced mock or gateway capabilities. The new server-side generalization relies on the default ExceptionProcessor implementation.\r\n\r\nSee class comments for details.\r\n\r\nHere are some design intents to help review：\r\n1、Why Design OmnipotentService？\r\nFrom the perspective of expansion, providing an ExceptionProcessor is enough. However, this may be troublesome when using extensions. Considering the gateway scenario, I hope that dubbo can normally receive any request and customize the processing (possibly forwarding). If only an exception is caught, it needs to return to the client after the request is processed. At this time, a lot of work needs to be done by the developer himself, such as dubbo protocol encoding, filter and other extension points, etc. If there is a service that simulates normal business, the ability of dubbo can be reused to reduce the workload.\r\nAt the same time, it also supports the spi method to replace the ExcepionProcessor to be more flexible. At this time, the OmnipotentService will not be available.\r\n2、Only intercept decode exceptions.\r\nExceptionProcessor can customize the exception type during decoding, and there are sufficient extension points in the subsequent steps, which do not need to be considered.\r\n3、Use retry to control the flow.\r\nBecause some abnormalities of decoding occur during decoding, some data in the channel has been read at this time. In order to complete the reading and release the channel, it needs to be read again. During the process, the read data needs to be cached to avoid reading errors again. After the second reading is completed, clean the channel, which is marked with a finishDecode field. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nProvides a custom extension for service not found.\r\nIssue Number: close #10950 \r\nrebase of #11060 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThe spi extension ExceptionProcessor is provided to allow custom exception handling when an exception occurs during the decode phase. At the same time, it provides an all-round generalization of the server, which can accept any interface, thereby providing enhanced mock or gateway capabilities. The new server-side generalization relies on the default ExceptionProcessor implementation.\r\nSee class comments for details.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T10:32:37Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T11:24:43Z","closed_at":"2022-12-12T12:41:00Z","merged_at":"2022-12-12T12:41:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"c768ad8f13186320de71a0df5e78acb08205106c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/26a6787d6b26346330e8ad7c143d2e7f46f3f346","head":{"label":"wlazjr:feature/triple_customer_protocol","ref":"feature/triple_customer_protocol","sha":"26a6787d6b26346330e8ad7c143d2e7f46f3f346","user":{"login":"wlazjr","id":28249419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjQ5NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28249419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr","html_url":"https://github.com/wlazjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":574484668,"node_id":"R_kgDOIj3wvA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wlazjr/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wlazjr","id":28249419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjQ5NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28249419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr","html_url":"https://github.com/wlazjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlazjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wlazjr/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T06:57:51Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T07:45:46Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T07:45:45Z","merged_at":"2022-12-06T07:45:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"a795ff73dff7318c564a3d38a19be97b92ce496a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/65","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/65","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/65/labels","id":8704553,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AhNIp","number":65,"title":"3.1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T02:54:22Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:16Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a5bda2d78e2cf72e670db8abc2e24ea7532b1b60","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/system_config","ref":"fix/system_config","sha":"a5bda2d78e2cf72e670db8abc2e24ea7532b1b60","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T02:51:15Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T12:11:16Z","closed_at":"2022-12-07T12:11:16Z","merged_at":"2022-12-07T12:11:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cccc4f193f36b4ff8fa2e4b77671e65dba32b7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5c9da13c0ce4dbdc26efd0751511870f753fe6f8","head":{"label":"EarthChen:opt-tri-some-code","ref":"opt-tri-some-code","sha":"5c9da13c0ce4dbdc26efd0751511870f753fe6f8","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"1470c7ca1eeba0ad4bcb309678e5c432bbfc002f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Due to the high-risk instructions in qos, this will lead to a series of security problems.\r\nWe should distinguish those commands with low-risk and high-risk, and support all client to request low-risk command for healthy check or metrics collection purpose.\r\n\r\n**TODO**:\r\n-  Indicate the permission level for each cmd (currently marked `live`, `startup`, `ready`,`quit` as public and others `PROTECTED`).\r\n-  Docs.\r\n\r\n\r\nclose #11015 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd new config `qos.anonymous.access.permission.level` to enable any foreign ip access. Default is `Cmd.PermissionLevel.NONE`, can not access any cmd (equivalent to disable the anonymous access config).\r\n\r\nPermission level has 4 levels, `PUBLIC(1)`, `PROTECTED(2)`,`PRIVATED(3)` and `NONE`( reversed to default anonymous permission level).\r\n\r\nIt allows to access all the cmds which have required permission is equal or lower than config permission level. i.e.\r\nIf `qos.anonymous.access.permission.level=PROTECTED`, it can anonymous access all the `PUBLIC` and `PROTECTED` cmds.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-05T09:46:48Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T03:06:00Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T03:06:00Z","merged_at":"2022-12-16T03:06:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"5fdc88d09e2fb7a6e795822ac9f9ebc4b8669c23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/784456341b56dd9cbec21961793507ec1efd481d","head":{"label":"EarthChen:fix-tri-convert-upper-header","ref":"fix-tri-convert-upper-header","sha":"784456341b56dd9cbec21961793507ec1efd481d","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"1470c7ca1eeba0ad4bcb309678e5c432bbfc002f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
