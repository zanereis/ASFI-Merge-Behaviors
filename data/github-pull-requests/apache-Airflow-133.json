have been studying Airflow's web analytics, and noticed that the Docker Compose Quick Start is a page that stands out a bit - people spend a lot of time here compared to other pages. So I started to investigate.\r\n\r\nThe language on that page is currently very strong, discouraging its use for almost all situations.  I had a few conversations with @potiuk and others about this page and heard an opinion that `airflow standalone` is a better procedure for those just getting started. The standalone Quick Start procedure has no such disclaimers, and is far simpler. After using that method for a few projects, I think I agree.\r\n\r\nHaving a strongly worded warning on the Docker Compose procedure may not be the best way to communicate that the standalone procedure is better. Instead, I think the Docker Compose procedure should be made into a How To, and the standalone procedure should take its place. This will clearly communicate the preference for the standalone procedure without making the Docker Compose unavailable to those who rely upon it.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to:\r\n1. Restore `start/local.rst` to `start.rst`\r\n2. Move `start/docker.rst` and associated assets to `howto/docker-compose/`\r\n3. Update links throughout to point at these new locations\r\n4. Create redirects to support these moved resources\r\n5. Reduce warnings in the Docker doc, now that it's not so prominent\r\n6. Misc copy updates in Docker doc, since I was in there :) \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ross Turk <ross@rossturk.com>\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a condition to the method `find_pod` to verify that the name of the pod matches the name defined by the user. This will ensure two pods with different names but identical context do not collide.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nTwo (or more) pods created with `KubernetesPodOperator` from identical context (`namespace`, `dag_id`, `task_id`, `run_id`, and `map_index`) across different Airflow environments (e.g. staging + production) collide, causing race conditions. This happens because the method `find_pods` in `KubernetesPodOperator` sees these pods as identical.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought this was a name collision, so I prepended the string `stg-`, or `prd-` (based on an Airflow Variable) to the pod name. It seems this did not fix my problem; however it made the problem easier to debug.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the logs below, instead of creating the pod `prd-example-9ba5a14b73ab41988c1c57afe5ec81f4`, KPO found the \"matching\" pod `stg-example-ce40ace00c704b87a56241b87bc4ff47`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n[2022-08-10, 07:56:49 EDT] {kubernetes_pod.py:221} INFO - Creating pod prd-example-9ba5a14b73ab41988c1c57afe5ec81f4 with labels: {'dag_id': 'example_k8s_pod_operator', 'task_id': 'run_k8s_pod', 'run_id': 'scheduled__2022-08-09T1145000000-c7f22427c', 'kubernetes_pod_operator': 'True', 'try_number': '4'}\r\n[2022-08-10, 07:56:49 EDT] {kubernetes_pod.py:366} INFO - Found matching pod stg-example-9ba5a14b73ab41988c1c57afe5ec81f4 with labels {'airflow_version': '2.3.2-astro.2', 'dag_id': 'example_k8s_pod_operator', 'kubernetes_pod_operator': 'True', 'run_id': 'scheduled__2022-08-09T1145000000-c7f22427c', 'task_id': 'run_k8s_pod', 'try_number': '4'}\r\n[2022-08-10, 07:56:49 EDT] {kubernetes_pod.py:367} INFO - `try_number` of task_instance: 4\r\n[2022-08-10, 07:56:49 EDT] {kubernetes_pod.py:368} INFO - `try_number` of pod: 4\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to see the `find_pod` method fail to find a pod in this situation, because the name does not match what the user defined.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nRun two Airflow projects with identical DAGs (same `dag_id` and schedule args) with an identical task (same `task_id`) like below:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    \"example_k8s_pod_operator\"\r\n    description=\"Runs scripts in Kubernetes Pods\",\r\n    default_args={\r\n        \"retries\": 1,\r\n        \"retry_delay\": timedelta(seconds=10),\r\n        \"trigger_rule\": \"all_done\",\r\n    },\r\n    start_date=datetime(2022, 1, 1),\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    KubernetesPodOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"run_k8s_pod\",\r\n        arguments=[\"Hello world!\"],\r\n        cmds=[\"echo\"],\r\n        get_logs=True,\r\n        image=\"ubuntu\",\r\n        # in_cluster=False,  # I am using a different cluster, but you should not need to\r\n        is_delete_operator_pod=True,\r\n        namespace=\"default\",\r\n        name=\"example\",  # Change this manually or with Airflow Variable\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange the argument `name`, so it is unique across your Airflow instances.\r\n\r\nTrigger these DAGs at approximately the same time for the same date (ensure `run_id` is the same).

was a typo that was not detected in the migration file which prevented upgrades.\r\nOn fixing the typo, some other migration issues were detected.\r\nApart from postgres, other dbs couldn't upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade. This was partly\r\nbecause we now create new DB from the ORM which also uses a naming convention to create constraints.\r\n\r\nI have applied a fix, the side effect is that it breaks offline generation of sql for mysql. This is because it uses the new naming convention to create constraints when we run upgrade through the migration file. In\r\nmigration file 0093, we dropped unique keys with names dag_id & dag_id_2 while with the naming\r\nconvention in place, these two now have a unique name across all db that's different from the names\r\nwe use to drop the keys. Because of that, I have chosen to use sqlalchemy inspector to get the name\r\nand drop them.","created_at":"2022-08-22T11:00:20Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T10:11:05Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T06:51:56Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T06:51:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"87c7867a23619fbab8e2da72ccddf5bc01266eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172802142,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAyMTQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:misc/internal","name":"type:misc/internal","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

change organizes better and improves overal output of the CI breeze\r\ncommands, in the way that it makes it far more useful.\r\n\r\n1. No more separated output for running command and it's output in\r\n   CI. They were displayed in separately foldable sections and it\r\n   has been somewhat misleading. Now, the folded section contain both\r\n   the command and its output.\r\n\r\n2. The heuristics to determine \"short\" name of a command has been\r\n   improved and the foldable groups for the command are more similar\r\n   to Github Actions runs (white color foldable) but also it has\r\n   pink automatically rich-highlighted main command that is run.\r\n\r\n3. CI groups (foldable components) will no longer overlap. Github\r\n   Actions does not support nested groups, so in case we start\r\n   group in another group, the first group is \"closed\" automatically.\r\n   With this change, if we start group inside of another group, the\r\n   original group is not closed (but also the new group is not started\r\n   and the nested command is not folded inside the main group.\r\n\r\n4. Progress output is much more consitent and nicer in case of\r\n   parallel runs. We have it nicely wrapped in rich rules, showing\r\n   how much time started with progress and single line of most\r\n   recent interesting output from the parallel operation. We have\r\n   \"smarter\" progress information implemented - showing much more\r\n   useful one-liner truncated and caloured status from each of the\r\n   running threads. Then all the individual outputs are nicer\r\n   summarized in the folded groups after all of the parallel runs\r\n   completed. No more spilling of the individual jobs into the\r\n   progress monitoring.\r\n\r\n5. When running the same CI parallel commands locally, the output\r\n   is adjusted to local terminal (no foldable groups and the output\r\n   from parallel jobs is only printed if the job fails by default.\r\n\r\nThis change has been extracted from #25678 as it grew out of it original\r\nscope.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

databases (at least Oracle) need mandatory `;` at the end of the SQL query.\r\nAlso, possibly semicolon stripping might affect T-SQL statements.\r\n\r\nHow to fix it?\r\n1.  Add optional `strip_semicolon` and set it to `False` by default in Oracle\r\n2. Remove stripping for all cases.\r\n\r\nI think the second solution is better because basically it returns previous behavior for the hook and does not add additional complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses:

constraint files should not contain apache-airflow. So far\r\napache-airflow has been automatically filtered out by the fact that it\r\nhas been an editable installation and we filtered out all editable\r\nand file installations from `pip freeze`.\r\n\r\nHowever as of ~12 August 2022, likely setuptools change triggered\r\na slight behaviour change when `eager-upgrade` installation of\r\nproviders from PyPi was run in the CI image. Previously airflow\r\nremained an editable install, but as of 12th of August, such an\r\ninstallation causes removal of editable airlfow install and\r\nreinstalls it in non-editable mode. While this change is somewhat\r\nconfusing, we have to protect against it and remove apache-airflow\r\nfrom `pip freeze` also in non-editable mode.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

know it's been a long-standing issue that it should be possible to import Airflow as a library without side-effects, and while I think the ultimate fix for this is to go through and steadily remove the need to call `settings.initalize()` in `__init__.py`, I am currently working on a project where I would really like to use Airflow without it doing strange things to logging, sys.path, or atexit.\r\n\r\nAs such, this PR wraps the import side-effect in a simple environment variable check that code can use to disable the side-effects for now, while we slowly try and progress towards a \"cleaner\" solution. Without this, I am having to dynamically modify the source code of `__init__.py` in an import hook, and nobody wants that!\r\n\r\nI don't believe it's possible to write tests for this as Airflow is already imported when tests are running, but if you can think of a way, let me know and I'll have a go. The environment variable name is also up for consideration - I just picked something that looked a bit like a setting, but we can deliberately make it not look like that if we want.","created_at":"2022-08-19T16:04:00Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T07:32:22Z","closed_at":"2022-08-19T17:12:59Z","merged_at":"2022-08-19T17:12:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e5cf6316e7e33f639baa3ee65295159e930c791","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

than a cluster policy level setting I have decided to add this to the Timetable as that felt like a more natural fit to me (Timetables are responsible for saying when a DagRun should be created, extending that to also make it say _what_ the run should be called felt like a natural etension to me.)\n\nThis isn't _quite_ as easy to control as the OP asked for (where you could just subclass `DAG` and add a method; timetables have to be \"registered\" via a plugin, but that can be in-tree).\n\nCloses #21923\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

Operator works very similarly to PythonVirtualenvOperator - but\r\ninstead of creating a virtualenv dynamically, it expects the\r\nPython binary to be available in the environment that Airlfow is run in.\r\n\r\nThe PR adds not only the implemenat the operator, but also\r\ndocuments the operator's use and adds best-practices chapter\r\nthat explains the differences between different ways how you can\r\nachieve separation of dependencies between different tasks. This\r\nhas been a question added many times in by our users, so adding\r\nthis operator and outlining future aspects of AIP-46 and AIP-43\r\nthat will make separate docker images another option is also\r\npart of this change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

\"driving\" factor of this was confusion/inconsistency over where\r\noutlets are stored. For BaseOperator it was stored on `self._outlets`, (but\r\nat execution time the `@prepare_lineage` decorator would munge it and\r\nmove things in to `self.outlets`.\r\n\r\nBut for MappedOperators a) this munging never took place, and b) it\r\nstored it on `self.outlets`.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the ambiguity and always stores inlets/outlets in the\r\n\"public\" attribute.\r\n\r\nAs a \"bonus\" change, this doesn't store empty lists in the serialized\r\nDAG for these two attributes\r\n\r\n(There's still some other problem going on with datasets + mapped tasks when it comes to actually
