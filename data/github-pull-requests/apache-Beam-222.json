Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis was missing JodaTime and JSR305 from multiple separate changes.\r\n\r\nTBR: @lukecwik the dependencies were introduced in

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis one allows JDBC to utilize the numberOfRecords pipeline option too, so that tests of different scale are possible. \r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n - I changed numberOfRecord's type from Long to Integer because to reach even tens of GBs we are fine with it and we do not need to do unnecessary long -> int conversions.\r\n - I double-checked it now and it seems that JdbcIO is fine with large amounts of data. 5 000 000 db rows test works well. \r\n\r\n@iemejia @chamikaramj  could you take a look?\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-11T16:16:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T11:38:43Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T07:20:49Z","merged_at":"2018-01-18T07:20:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f235dd58acce27f713c7072d62cd3a72e3413a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/eaef1ed2bac0e4c50a4f19edf4fc1174f9118aad","head":{"label":"lgajowy:jdbc-large-scale","ref":"jdbc-large-scale","sha":"eaef1ed2bac0e4c50a4f19edf4fc1174f9118aad","user":{"login":"lgajowy","id":1932045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzIwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1932045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy","html_url":"https://github.com/lgajowy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95001513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTAwMTUxMw==","name":"beam","full_name":"lgajowy/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lgajowy","id":1932045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzIwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1932045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy","html_url":"https://github.com/lgajowy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgajowy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lgajowy/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

(usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that this change is based on #4343.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-10T16:14:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T06:46:22Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T00:21:02Z","merged_at":"2018-01-30T00:21:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"d11e5030f3a011c6fecba1f3d3b2bf6ebd8913c8","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/24a8fe6b71739339ddf17f416e9b81ae8863459a","head":{"label":"iemejia:update-maven-plugins","ref":"update-maven-plugins","sha":"24a8fe6b71739339ddf17f416e9b81ae8863459a","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58313008,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODMxMzAwOA==","name":"beam","full_name":"iemejia/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nAdd the ability to length prefix unknown coders using the portable representation allowing a Runner to not need to know about all

goal for BEAM-2732 is to refactor the context trackers in the Python SDK so that they will all use the same mechanism.\r\nCurrently, Metrics, Logging and StateSampler keep their own contexts. BEAM-2732 aims to have all of them rely on the logic in StateSampler to keep their context (this is already the case in Java).\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n* Clean up legacy code in the StateSampler.\r\n* Adds a global per-thread variable for state sampler, so each execution thread will be able to access the current state sampler from this global variable (this will then be used for LoggingContext, and MetricsEnvironment.current_container).\r\n* Gives the Python-only state sampler functionality to track context, so that non-Cythonized runners can rely on the StateSampler to track context.","created_at":"2018-01-09T22:05:23Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T21:40:08Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T21:39:49Z","merged_at":"2018-01-18T21:39:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"24e6bf81790b97024fe1871575186d9db325bf1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4375/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4375/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4375/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/d3d0cf644e05496acbc11ad7c5b8ea7e6d527a05","head":{"label":"pabloem:global-sampler-var","ref":"global-sampler-var","sha":"d3d0cf644e05496acbc11ad7c5b8ea7e6d527a05","user":{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69611732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTYxMTczMg==","name":"beam","full_name":"pabloem/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nAdd the ability to create an offline repository using

and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T10:00:41Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T11:00:04Z","closed_at":"2018-01-10T11:00:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75b16baf9ec452d19109cb282a6840c956935f8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/7b42da2498851dd7e092bbf77c7f094aaa17d52e","head":{"label":"DariuszAniszewski:patch-3","ref":"patch-3","sha":"7b42da2498851dd7e092bbf77c7f094aaa17d52e","user":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109828390,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk4MjgzOTA=","name":"beam","full_name":"DariuszAniszewski/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to m ake sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-07T18:20:04Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T05:51:32Z","closed_at":"2018-01-24T05:51:32Z","merged_at":"2018-01-24T05:51:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2503bad7511ef5f4856fc8af9c24b01a8561b3c","assignee":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/8c2e7db12e97893200d2ccfd8bfbfa0a178a2c8c","head":{"label":"dmytroivanov4206:master","ref":"master","sha":"8c2e7db12e97893200d2ccfd8bfbfa0a178a2c8c","user":{"login":"dmytroivanov4206","id":26084864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26084864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206","html_url":"https://github.com/dmytroivanov4206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110739596,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA3Mzk1OTY=","name":"beam","full_name":"dmytroivanov4206/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dmytroivanov4206","id":26084864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26084864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206","html_url":"https://github.com/dmytroivanov4206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmytroivanov4206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-06T19:10:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T21:20:39Z","closed_at":"2018-01-17T05:59:23Z","merged_at":"2018-01-17T05:59:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"e977cdff1718b2316115f63903762380c15530de","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/8afe0be865d1728ae049458006d93f661e2ed801","head":{"label":"kennknowles:dataflow-ids","ref":"dataflow-ids","sha":"8afe0be865d1728ae049458006d93f661e2ed801","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mir

and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-06T02:16:49Z","updated_at":"2018-01-08T07:13:36Z","closed_at":"2018-01-08T07:13:36Z","merged_at":"2018-01-08T07:13:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2ec8961b98f20c4e81c9290f3e6b707a13c2b4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/944091e92439a06e87f6ee6b3d876037a2bb5273","head":{"label":"angoenka:progress_report_fix_3411","ref":"progress_report_fix_3411","sha":"944091e92439a06e87f6ee6b3d876037a2bb5273","user":{"login":"angoenka","id":38219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka","html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108601385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg2MDEzODU=","name":"beam","full_name":"angoenka/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"angoenka","id":38219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka","html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka/beam","description":"Mirror

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

managed to sneak a change into Flink 1.4.0 that allows blocking on pending process-time timers. Now we can finally fix those tests for the Flink Runner. 😃 \r\n\r\nMost of these changes are pretty straightforward, the only controversial change is using the output WM instead of the input WM for determining lateness in `StateFulDoFnRunner`. This is there to make sure that timers (which are elements to the `ProcessFn`) are not dropped when the input watermark goes to `+Inf`. I tried changing `FlinkTimerInternals.currentInputWatermarkTime()` to be held back by the watermark hold but that doesn't work because windows and stuff will then never fire.","created_at":"2018-01-05T13:58:45Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T09:42:41Z","closed_at":"2018-02-08T12:25:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ee0259735573be808b6147149a86e751690c79e","assignee":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/88a6753e5920fc01b02f57af64bcc6ca254d344b","head":{"label":"aljoscha:fix-flink-splittable-dofn","ref":"fix-flink-splittable-dofn","sha":"88a6753e5920fc01b02f57af64bcc6ca254d344b","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55508677,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTUwODY3Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"aljoscha/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url"

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIT(Integration Tests) are using `TestPipeline.convertToArgs` to convert well-defined options to list of pipeline-recognizable arguments and pass to pipeline main function. Incorrect arguments format will be returned if an option attribute type is `List`. \r\n\r\nOne solution is that IT can use `beamTestExtraOptions` to pass options directly to pipeline main function without passing through `TestPipeline.converToArgs`.\r\n\r\nFor example, when a test option have a attribute called `listArgs` with value `[\"item1\",\"item2\"]`, `TestPipeline.convertToArgs(options)` will return:\r\nbefore fix: `--listArgs=[\"item1\", \"item2\"]` (which cannot be parsed)\r\nafter fix: `--listArgs=item1, --listArgs=item2`","created_at":"2018-01-05T00:01:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T04:20:34Z","closed_at":"2018-01-17T23:50:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5dcfadbeca3b6c0b296bfc9fba1151e2d829e69","assignee":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/473a5bd5889acbcf4855aaad0426bfc4e789bb1e","head":{"label":"markflyhigh:fix-testpipeline-covert-args","ref":"fix-testpipeline-covert-args","sha":"473a5bd5889acbcf4855aaad0426bfc4e789bb1e","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61327747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTMyNzc0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"markflyhigh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh/beam","description":"Apache

was tested by round-tripping batch pipelines to and from protobuf form. It works with both real Java pipelines and rehydrated pipelines.\r\n\r\nReferences and downcasts to specific transform subclasses are replaced with generic `PTransform`s. Transform metadata is now accessed through the translation utilities under `org.apache.beam.runners.core.construction`.\r\n\r\n`CombineTranslation` uses a new side input extractor modeled after `ParDoTranslation#getSideInputs`.\r\n\r\nThe `RawCombine` rehydrated transform exposes side inputs via `getAdditionalInputs`. Side inputs were not previously exposed as \"additional\" inputs, so `FlinkBatchTranslationContext#getInput` could not properly extract the main output collection when side inputs were used.\r\n\r\nThe `ParDo` union coder is picky about ordering. It appears that coders must appear at the same indexes as their respective output collection tags. This ordering is now preserved.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis PR adds Samza runner to BEAM. The overall design is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aeCYSXMTvxvFF2T_5D8y-DECfcF1iLzqCN3yGgE8TaE/edit?usp=sharing). The Samza runner supports most of the BEAM transformations, side input/output, and unbounded/bounded sources. The features not in the scope of this PR are:\r\n - Support for stateful DoFn\r\n - Support for splittable DoFn\r\n\r\nIntegration tests are verified by running mvn install -P  local-validates-runner-tests.\r\n\r\n@kennknowles : Please help us take a look.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nKinesis tests are hanging on KinesisMockReadTest and then it fails because of crashing forked VM. \r\nSince it affects master build and the root cause is not clear for now, then the fast fix to prevent this issue will be to fork every running test. Later, the root cause should be investigated and, probably, fixed if needed. \r\nThe total time of running the all Kinesis tests was not drastically increased, only a little bit due to small number of Kinesis test suits.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@chamikaramj could you take a look? What do you think about the idea of using JdbcIO to write the data? There is no write in HadoopInputFormatIO. \r\n\r\nCurrently the test is working only for small datasets (100 000 rows, which is about 3,43 MB). For 1 000 000 rows the test is flaky (different hashes get generated). I'm investigating the cause now. After that I'm planning to add the a large dataset hash. \r\n\r\nAlso, last thing: large scale scenarios (e.g 40 000 000 rows, which is 10gb according to dataflow's estimation) can take quite a long time to run. Only the write pipline executes for more than 35 minutes. The JdbcIO.write() seems to be the bottleneck, as it is done sequentially - one-row inserts, one after another. I think grouping and then inserting \"batches\" of rows to the database will speed things up, though I don't know how much. Should I do this or the execution time is bearable? Are there some other optimisations I might want to consider?\r\n\r\nPS: Happy new year! 🎊

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-28T18:17:59Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T17:41:38Z","closed_at":"2018-01-02T17:41:38Z","merged_at":"2018-01-02T17:41:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"6450a9ca0f99f5a5d4cce4e4bb84a7c814c98407","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a51fc4804b8c15118cde26b65b389149318ed93e","head":{"label":"akedin:sql-fix-shading","ref":"sql-fix-shading","sha":"a51fc4804b8c15118cde26b65b389149318ed93e","user":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108159679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgxNTk2Nzk=","name":"beam","full_name":"akedin/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akedin/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

pull request adds PTransforms to estimate the frequency of elements in a stream using Stream-Lib's Count-Min sketch implementation. \r\nThe SketchFrequencies class is designed in the same manner as ApproximateDistinct. It takes any encodable input and outputs a Count-Min Sketch that can be queried.\r\n\r\nSome elements to discuss in particular : \r\n\r\n- The stream-lib's Count-Min sketch implementation is embedded in an inner class \"Sketch\", so the user doesn't have to pull the Stream-Lib dependency.\r\n\r\n- The elements are hashed using Google's MurmurHash in 128 bits because Stream-Lib's Count-Min sketch only support Long or String types. This could be simplified using Spark-sketch implementation which also support Byte Arrays as input type, but it would pull more dependencies.\r\n\r\n- The user has to provide the element coder in order to query its estimate frequency from the resulting sketch (see estimateCount() method in Sketch class).\r\nIt could be avoided if the coder was defined as an attribute of the inner Sketch, but in that case it should be serialized in the Sketch coder.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nRemove the receiving queue for an instruction_id after an instruction_id is

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-21T23:57:15Z","updated_at":"2017-12-23T01:12:34Z","closed_at":"2017-12-23T01:12:34Z","merged_at":"2017-12-23T01:12:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"aaa0ae6d9df55a4d22d9a817af37a08457dd4628","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/cc24c714e57520c068c80041c5a21e5ad328cf06","head":{"label":"robertwb:robertwb-patch-1","ref":"robertwb-patch-1","sha":"cc24c714e57520c068c80041c5a21e5ad328cf06","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avata

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSupport using multiple key ranges when reading from BigTable. This is useful for applications that want to read non contiguous keys in one BigTable query.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, this PR tweaks BigTableSource's existing methods that split and estimate size based on samples to now work with multiple key ranges. These are relatively simple extensions, applying the previous logic of splitting one key range to each key range, with some edge cases. E.g. when estimating the size of the ranges based on samples, even if two ranges overlap a given sample range, we only want to add the sample range's size to the estimate once.\r\n\r\nThen, a range tracker for multiple key ranges is defined as ByteKeyRangesTracker. This tracker sorts the list of key ranges on instantiation and operates on them similar to ByteKeyRangeTracker. These classes operate similar enough that an abstract base class was created to share functionality. A key difference is the multi-range tracker has a method to interpolate a key across its multiple ranges. The BigTableReader uses this multi-range tracker when splitting it's source into primary and residual parts.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-21T23:05:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T21:23:43Z","closed_at":"2018-01-17T21:23:43Z","merged_at":"2018-01-17T21:23:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"dacd1e41df9bb720fc3266624c5d50c82d83dc6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/d0a2a02d0ae06c617b5dd9f593dc3dfd21ecc27c","head":{"label":"rniemo-g:multiple-row-ranges","ref":"multiple-row-ranges","sha":"d0a2a02d0ae06c617b5dd9f593dc3dfd21ecc27c","user":{"login":"rniemo-g","id":22622466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjIyNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22622466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g","html_url":"https://github.com/rniemo-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105193555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDUxOTM1NTU=","name":"beam","full_name":"rniemo-g/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rniemo-g","id":22622466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjIyNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22622466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g","html_url":"https://github.com/rniemo-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rniemo-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rniemo-g/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-21T16:20:58Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T09:19:19Z","closed_at":"2018-01-12T01:11:16Z","merged_at":"2018-01-12T01:11:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1307f9d89de8f6b2253dc407fd11a446f7abd49e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/dfd23875d26680815e155b0c509648b16b09ee40","head":{"label":"DariuszAniszewski:filebasedioit-timeout","ref":"filebasedioit-timeout","sha":"dfd23875d26680815e155b0c509648b16b09ee40","user":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109828390,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk4MjgzOTA=","name":"beam","full_name":"DariuszAniszewski/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License
