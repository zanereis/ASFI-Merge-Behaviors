--describe --group ...` can result in NullPointerException for two reasons:\r\n1)  Fetcher.fetchOffsetsByTimes() may return too early, without sending list offsets request for topic partitions that are not in cached metadata.\r\n2) `ConsumerGroupCommand.getLogEndOffsets()` and `getLogStartOffsets()` assumed that endOffsets()/beginningOffsets() which eventually call Fetcher.fetchOffsetsByTimes(), would return a map with all the topic partitions passed to endOffsets()/beginningOffsets() and that values are not null. Because of (1), null values were possible if some of the topic partitions were already known (in metadata cache) and some not (metadata cache did not have entries for some of the topic partitions). However, even with fixing (1), endOffsets()/beginningOffsets() may return a map with some topic partitions missing, when list offset request returns a non-retriable error. This happens in corner cases such as message format on broker is before 0.10, or maybe in cases of some other errors. \r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-- added unit test to verify fix in Fetcher.fetchOffsetsByTimes() \r\n-- did some manual testing with `kafka-consumer-groups --describe`, causing NPE.

idempotent producers, we may leave empty batches in the log during log compaction. When filtering the data, we keep track of state like `maxOffset` and `maxTimestamp` of filtered data. This patch ensures we maintain this state correctly for the case when only empty batches are left in `MemoryRecords#filterTo`. Without this patch, we did not initialize `maxOffset` in this edge case which led us to append data to the log with `maxOffset` = -1L, causing the append to fail and log cleaner to

`ignore` annotations from the upgrade tests.  This PR includes the following changes for updating the upgrade tests:\r\n\r\n1. Uploaded new versions `0.10.2.2`, `0.11.0.3`, `1.0.2`, `1.1.1`, and `2.0.0` (in the associated scala versions) to kafka-packages\r\n2. Update versions in `version.py`, `Dockerfile`, `base.sh`\r\n3. Added new versions to `StreamsUpgradeTest.test_upgrade_downgrade_brokers` *_including_* version `2.0.0` \r\n4. Added new versions `StreamsUpgradeTest.test_simple_upgrade_downgrade` test *_excluding_* version `2.0.0`\r\n     1. Version `2.0.0` is excluded from the streams upgrade/downgrade test as `StreamsConfig` needs an update for the new version, requiring a KIP. Once the community votes the KIP in, a minor follow-up PR can be pushed to add the `2.0.0` version to the upgrade test.\r\n5. Fixed minor bug in `kafka-run-class.sh` for classpath in upgrade/downgrade tests across versions.\r\n\r\nFollow on PRs for `0.10.2x`, `0.11.0x`, `1.0.x`, `1.1.x`, and `2.0.x` will be pushed soon with the same updates required for the specific version.\r\n\r\nFor testing, the following https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/1942/ branch builder was executed and passed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-03T20:19:23Z","updated_at":"2024-07-10T13:56:11Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T20:46:48Z","merged_at":"2018-09-13T20:46:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"b74e7e407c0b065adf68bc45042063def922aa10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5605/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5605/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5605/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/16e7a0147fd58b9c3c876902b1fef6fae6638fad","head":{"label":"bbejeck:MINOR_enable_ignored_upgrade_system_tests","ref":"MINOR_enable_ignored_upgrade_system_tests","sha":"16e7a0147fd58b9c3c876902b1fef6fae6638fad","user":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42054236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjA1NDIzNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"bbejeck/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck/kafka","description":"Mirror

adoption of KIP-255: OAuth Authentication via\r\nSASL/OAUTHBEARER in release 2.0.0 creates the possibility of\r\nusing information in the bearer token to make authorization\r\ndecisions. Unfortunately, however, Kafka connections are\r\nlong-lived, so there is no ability to change the bearer token\r\nassociated with a particular connection. Allowing SASL\r\nconnections to periodically re-authenticate would resolve this.\r\nIn addition to this motivation there are two others that are\r\nsecurity-related. First, to eliminate access to Kafka for\r\nconnected clients, the current requirement is to remove all\r\nauthorizations (i.e. remove all ACLs). This is necessary because\r\nof the long-lived nature of the connections. It is operationally\r\nsimpler to shut off access at the point of authentication, and\r\nwith the release of KIP-86: Configurable SASL Callback Handlers\r\nit is going to become more and more likely that installations\r\nwill authenticate users against external directories (e.g. via\r\nLDAP). The ability to stop Kafka access by simply disabling an\r\naccount in an LDAP directory (for example) is desirable. The\r\nsecond motivating factor for re-authentication related to\r\nsecurity is that the use of short-lived tokens is a common OAuth\r\nsecurity recommendation, but issuing a short-lived token to a\r\nKafka client (or a broker when OAUTHBEARER is the inter-broker\r\nprotocol) currently has no benefit because once a client is\r\nconnected to a broker the client is never challenged again and\r\nthe connection may remain intact beyond the token expiration time\r\n(and may remain intact indefinitely under perfect circumstances).\r\nThis KIP proposes adding the ability for clients (and brokers\r\nwhen OAUTHBEARER is the inter-broker protocol) to re-authenticate\r\ntheir connections to brokers and for brokers to close connections\r\nthat continue to use expired sessions.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ron Dagostino

Description\r\nDuring the consumer group rebalance, when the joining group phase finishes, the heartbeat delayed operation of the consumer that fails to rejoin the group should be removed from the purgatory. Otherwise, even though the member ID of the consumer has been removed from the group, its heartbeat delayed operation is still registered in the purgatory and the heartbeat delayed operation is going to timeout and then another unnecessary rebalance is triggered because of it.\r\n\r\n### Summary of testing strategy\r\nExtend one of the existing unit test \"testRebalanceCompletesBeforeMemberJoins\" to verify that the delayed heart beat operation has actually been removed so that it would not trigger another unnecessary group rebalance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-22T18:45:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T16:24:19Z","closed_at":"2018-10-04T16:18:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f6d115db2707421a1c39a09fdd16b005e366f58","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/687a2b1a4ce463531dc7b4028b0dd7ba21cbc646","head":{"label":"Lincong:remove_heartbeat_delayedOperation","ref":"remove_heartbeat_delayedOperation","sha":"687a2b1a4ce463531dc7b4028b0dd7ba21cbc646","user":{"login":"Lincong","id":9780681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3ODA2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9780681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong","html_url":"https://github.com/Lincong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/

the only way to add a new variable to the `jaas.conf` template file is to directly edit the path the config is constructed by adding new keyword arguments.\r\nThis wasn't necessarily a big problem, since you'd only need edit the `security_config.py` file as JAAS settings should come from the security settings.\r\n\r\nNow, with the addition of [KIP-342](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-342%3A+Add+support+for+Custom+SASL+extensions+in+OAuthBearer+authentication), the OAuthBearer JAAS config supports arbitrary values in the form of SASL extensions.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be nice if we could make adding arbitrary values to the JAAS config in tests as painless as possible for future tests.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\nThe same problem to a lesser extent exists in the `.properties` template files for consumer/producer.  That one can easily be worked around, since ducktape attaches a class' variables to the template file (https://github.com/confluentinc/ducktape/blob/d7226d83aa11538765d352f69bbf75e0c27e6304/ducktape/template.py#L34)\r\nWe can see this being used in multiple tests:\r\n* https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3511e904effbfb74fa54c26467477863b7f730c0/tests/kafkatest/services/mirror_maker.py#L81 - variables used in `mirror_maker_consumer.properties`\r\n* https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3511e904effbfb74fa54c26467477863b7f730c0/tests/kafkatest/services/mirror_maker.py#L78 - variable used in `mirror_maker_producer.properties`\r\n\r\nI find it would be better if config variables were set explicitly and would not require the developer to read through the framework code to understand how they're populated. So future work might make all sorts of config variables passable through constructors. (Maybe we could have a single class encapsulating all variables, then, as having producer/consumer constructors accept `jaas_override_variables` is a bit non-ideal)\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-22T10:08:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T21:55:41Z","closed_at":"2018-08-23T21:55:41Z","merged_at":"2018-08-23T21:55:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"7884258489a190f076b0d4bd85ca68dbf808a989","assignee":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5554/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5554/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5554/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/81a223fe83e309ff3b8a28a2131d0c890ddeda08","head":{"label":"stanislavkozlovski:system-tests-configurable-jaas-config","ref":"system-tests-configurable-jaas-config","sha":"81a223fe83e309ff3b8a28a2131d0c890ddeda08","user":{"login":"stanislavkozlovski","id":13639618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjM5NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13639618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski","html_url":"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"3511e904effbfb74fa54c26467477863b7f730c0","u

@rhauch, @ewencp et al., here's a proposal for [KAFKA-3821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3821) based on my latest comment on the JIRA issue. It'd need more polishing and testing, but I wanted to demonstrate the idea and see whether you agree with it before spending more time on it.\r\n\r\nI think it's the simplest way to let source connectors produce offsets without emitting messages and without creating an awkward inheritance relationship of `SourceRecord` and a sub-class just carrying offset information. Please see [this comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3821?focusedCommentId=16564900&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16564900) on the JIRA issue for the two use cases of this new functionality.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to learn about your toughts. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

I have this use case I'm not too sure how to address:\r\n```scala\r\nval stateStore = \"store\"\r\nval materialized = Materialized.as[String, Long,

Long](stateStore).get(\"1\") shouldBe 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me it sounds like we should be able to get the store from/with the `Materialized` object. It's much better typed than a `String`:\r\n```scala\r\nval materialized = Materialized.as[String, Long, ByteArrayKeyValueStore](stateStore)\r\n...\r\ntable1.join(table2, materialized)((a, b) => a +
