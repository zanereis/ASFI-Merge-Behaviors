adds support for what PyTorch calls \"dynamic quantization\", where weights are quantized ahead of time but activations are quantized on the fly at runtime. See more details in:\r\nhttps://pytorch.org/blog/introduction-to-quantization-on-pytorch/#the-three-modes-of-quantization-supported-in-pytorch-starting-version-13\r\nhttps://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/dynamic_quantization.html\r\nhttps://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dynamic_quantization_bert_tutorial.html\r\n\r\nTVM doesn't support such quantization flow at the moment. This flow is in a sweep spot in terms of quantization easy of use and performance, so I think this is worth supporting. Here are pros/cons compared to the static quantization (the one we do support):\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* API is trivial and quantization is automatic. No need to rewrite a model or do calibration (which is required for other quantization workflow in PyTorch).\r\n* Weight is quantized ahead of time, so model size becomes much smaller. We can also use int8 math.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* Scale and zero point calculation is done at runtime, so there is some overhead compared to the more standard static quantization.\r\n\r\nMy motivation for introducing this flow is to support quantized models from `transformers` like BERT and GPT2, where dynamic quantization via PyTorch or ONNXRuntime is the only quantization path they support (from what I understand). See the following blog post and the accompanying notebook by the ONNXRuntime team for inspiration.\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/microsoftazure/faster-and-smaller-quantized-nlp-with-hugging-face-and-onnx-runtime-ec5525473bb7\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/python/tools/quantization/notebooks/Bert-GLUE_OnnxRuntime_quantization.ipynb\r\n\r\nThis PR has changes required for supporting dynamic quantization flow via QNN.\r\n* Support non constant qparams in QNN quantize and dense op\r\n* Add Torchscript `quantized::linear_dynamic` op converter in PyTorch frontend.\r\n\r\nI prepared [a script](https://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/tree/master/transformers) to evaluate accuracy and performance of BERT quantized via dynamic quantization, and compiled by TVM. The accuracy is reasonable but performance is terrible. Even with MKL enabled, TVM int8 is 3-4x slower than PyTorch (I haven't looked into details). I sense a big oppotunity here.\r\n\r\nplease review @anijain2305 @siju-samuel @t-vi @jwfromm

is a follow up to the discussion in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/6383. \r\n\r\nRecently I've hit a model (`gpt2` from transformers) that has a `where` op with following shapes:\r\n* condition: (1, 1, 12, 12)\r\n* x (true case): (1, 8, 12, 12)\r\n* y (false case): scalar\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to support such combinations of shapes by yet another ad hoc band-aid, so I decided to roll a complete support for numpy style broadcasting. This turned out to be easy thanks to existing  broadcasting utilities in relay/topi. I think this is desirable feature to align with other frameworks that follow numpy style where op (pytorch, onnx etc). \r\n\r\nI added tests that replicate examples in numpy where op doc https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html. I think my implementation is correct, but since this is my first attempt to implement an op with broadcasting semantics, reviews by people who are familiar with broadcast issues are highly appreciated. \r\n\r\nWith this PR, I can load `gpt2` model from transformers using PyTorch frontend, compile and get correct outputs compared to PyTorch.\r\n\r\nplease review @zhiics @junrushao1994

collection of new utility functions allows enables a starting floating point model to be converted to a datatype and format that can be run using the efficient HWNC tensorcore schedules introduced in #6121. Although these schedules are the fastest available in TVM, they have a few very specific requirements that make it difficult to apply generally to models. Specifically, compatible operators must have inputs set to `int4` or `int8`, all compatible layers must be in the `HWNC` layout, and incompatible layers should be left in their original layout and datatype. There are currently not tools to make such changes to an existing model. To address this, I've written the following utilities:\r\n\r\n`count_layers`: A pass that determines the number of layers of the specified operator in a graph. Although generally useful, for tensorcores we use this to enable the `skip_layers` feature.\r\n\r\n`recast`: A pass that changes the input and output datatype of all specified operators in a graph, with the option to skip a set of layers. Although this pass is only useful for benchmarking as it does not apply any intelligent quantization, this type of utility is a common topic on the Discuss forums and can serve as a good example for users interested in similar functionality.\r\n\r\n`LayoutConfig`: An optional scope that can be applied around the `ConvertLayout` pass. In this PR I use it to enable skipping the conversion of specified conv2d layers, but it could be extended for other customization down the line.\r\n\r\nHWNC support for `ConvertLayout`.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these utilities allows us to target HWNC tensorcores using a workflow such as this:\r\n```\r\nmod, params = relay.testing.resnet.get_workload()\r\nlayout_config = relay.transform.LayoutConfig(skip_layers=[0])\r\ndesired_layouts = {'nn.conv2d: ['HWNC', 'default']}\r\nwith layout_config:\r\n    seq =

be called with any custom values of ```int32_lanes``` and ```int8_elements```\r\n * Such flexibility (custom lane&elements) will be desired for future customizable ISA.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n1. Make ```n_elems``` (default=4) **optional parameter** instead of static ```n_elems = 4``` hardcode.\r\n2. Default **fallback config** now emit valid configuration for cases when```int32_lane < int8_num_elements``` too.\r\n3.

previous implementation of initial population sampling treats a state as valid as long as we didn't encounter any problem when applying the initial population rules. However, it's possible that all states outputted by this phase cannot successfully either be lowered, extract features, or pass the GPU code verification (due to invalid thread number or memory usage). In this case, the evo search is trapped in a set of invalid states and it's inefficient for it to find a valid point.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we improved the initial population sampling to perform the same process as we did in the evo search. Specifically, all states have to be lowered and estimated to make sure they are valid. Note that this will also increase the time of sampling initial population. Here is an example log of tuning a forward conv2d (last layer in ResNet) on Nvidia T4 for 64 trials:\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------  [ Search ]\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGenerate

pr implements the basic relay integration for auto-scheduler.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n1. register auto-scheduler as an implementation in the OpStrategy. We have a universal schedule function for all topi compute functions.\r\n2. Use tracing to extract all tasks similar to autotvm.\r\n\r\nIf auto-scheduler is enabled by `auto_scheduler.enable_relay_integration`, then auto-scheduler is always preferred to any other registered implementations.\r\n\r\n## Limitation\r\nIdeally, we should be able to mix autotvm, auto-scheduler, and static libraries,  then we can select the best implementation according to profiling records.\r\nHowever, this is not trivial to implement, because auto-scheduler works on a subgraph level while the current OpStrategy is designed for single operator level.\r\nThe limitation of OpStrategy also makes auto-scheduler unable to support multiple compute declarations. For example, auto-scheduler cannot select direct vs. winograd based on profiling records, while autotvm can easily do this.\r\n\r\n## Minor todo\r\n- [x] Add an API to disable the cache in relay compilation, so we can extract the weights (i.e., the number of appearances) of each task for the task-scheduler.\r\n- [x] Clean up

PR adds two Vagrantfiles:\r\n - a µTVM base box in `tools/microtvm/base-box` intended to support general µTVM development. it includes all the dependencies necessary to build the Zephyr runtime and test it with attached hardware (I.e. use USB port forwarding). This means it includes cross-compilers for RISC-V, ARM, and x86, among others (see Zephyr SDK).\r\n- a specialization of the base box which mounts the local `tvm` directory using Host-VM shared folders, builds your local copy of TVM inside the VM, then creates a poetry (Python) virtualenv containing all TVM and Zephyr dependencies. You can use this VM to test µTVM against real hardware, for example:\r\n    `tvm@microtvm:/Users/andrew/ws/tvm2$ TVM_LIBRARY_PATH=build-microtvm poetry run python3 tests/micro/qemu/test_zephyr.py --microtvm-platforms=stm32f746xx -s`\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes additional transports needed to talk to real hardware, specifically a pySerial-based RPC transport layer plus utilities to invoke GDB to debug e.g. runtime problems, bad operator implementations, and to help with porting to new architectures. Because µTVM aims to be platform-agnostic, µTVM assumes only that some shell command exists to launch GDB and connect to the SoC's debug port. Due to this constraint, an additional RPC server is included: `tvm.exec.microtvm_debug_shell`, which uses the event-driven RPC server to host the debugger in a dedicated shell, so that signals can be forwarded to the inferior GDB.\r\n\r\ncc @tmoreau89 @tqchen @u99127 @tom-gall @liangfu @mshawcroft

PR adds a converter for Loop operators in Onnx. Loops in onnx are represented as entire onnx graphs embedded within the op. To support this structure, there are few changes to the GraphProto class to allow access to the parent graph from a called subgraph using scope. It's worth noting that I encountered some issues with type unification when strided slices were part of the subgraph. For now, I've added a warning that indicates errors might occur in this case, but will add corresponding tests once the issue is

PR improves the cache read sketch generation rule in auto-scheduler to support multiple cache reads. Previously, cache read sketch generation rule will simply give up if a tensor has multiple consumers. This results in all consumers read that tensor directly from the host memory, which hurts the performance a lot. This PR resolves this limitation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also fixes the following bugs/issues:\r\n- Consider `max_threads_per_block` in cross thread reduction rule condition, so that we can guarantee computation intensive ops won't have cross thread reduction sketch, which usually doesn't help.\r\n- Add `.d` suffix to the name of redundant cache read ops to avoid conflict. Without this change, auto-scheduler outputs Python schedule APIs won't work for multiple cache reads.\r\n- Add a new constructor of `ComputeDAG` by taking a schedule, so that we can enforce stage order consistency.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jcf94 @tqchen

PR contains two otherwise unrelated bug fixes / improvements that allow us to import a class of segmentation models using the Onnx frontend.\r\n\r\nThe first is the ability to broadcast the batch dimension of the left hand side argument of `batch_matmul` to to the right hand side argument, where we previously only allowed rhs to lhs broadcasting. There are a few bug fixes in relay to enable this. \r\n\r\nThe second is a fix to our strided slice shape inference to allow reverse slicing, specifically when the end is a negative number, indicating that we should iterate all the way to the first element. A test case in relay is added to catch this in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, I removed some unneeded type inference and shape checking in padding.","created_at":"2020-10-14T01:56:12Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:11Z","closed_at":"2020-10-15T03:49:14Z","merged_at":"2020-10-15T03:49:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"9564925ae22aab8392a23cd9afa5843d6c96bb48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3235e5111685e303daa1157c625db7804a512c0e","head":{"label":"jwfromm:slice_fixes","ref":"slice_fixes","sha":"3235e5111685e303daa1157c625db7804a512c0e","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open
