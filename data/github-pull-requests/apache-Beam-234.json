pipeline rehydration work to get prerequisites in place in pieces.\r\n\r\n - More-specific renames of each of the pluralized classes and all-static translator classes.\r\n - `RawPTransform` is the thing that will be built from a proto. It just has a URN and payload, but we might add conveniences like `RawParDo` that exposes all the expected methods. (naming TBD)\r\n - The translator can just give a URN without actually translating, since that might be common and shared between pre-proto and post-proto transforms. Previously the only access to a URN was via a full translation.\r\n - The direct runner keys its evaluators on URNs. Later, they should work only with post-proto stuff, or otherwise be agnostic as to whether the pipeline is pre/post proto. Even later, the overrides should be similarly ported.","created_at":"2017-05-20T04:52:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T15:42:03Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T04:08:23Z","merged_at":"2017-05-26T04:08:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e29cc52a3e4b0d9ae5ff3907f10e4e87b734186","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3195/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3195/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3195/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/0e29cc52a3e4b0d9ae5ff3907f10e4e87b734186","head":{"label":"kennknowles:DirectRunner-URNs","ref":"DirectRunner-URNs","sha":"0e29cc52a3e4b0d9ae5ff3907f10e4e87b734186","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

@aljoscha  because we discussed NexMark together :)\r\nCC: @mshields822 I know you don not work on it anymore, but you might be interested :)\r\nCC: @ssisk for reflexion for IT tests\r\n\r\nThis is a port of the NexMark queries to Beam, to be used as integration tests.\r\nThis can also be used as A-B testing (no-regression or performance comparison between 2 versions of the same engine or of the same runner)\r\n\r\nThis a continuation of the previous PRs (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/99 and https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/366) from Mark Shields.\r\nThe code has changed quite a bit: some queries have changed to use new Beam APIs and there where some big refactorings. More important, we can now run all the queries in all the runners. Nevertheless, there are still some open issues in Nexmark (https://github.com/iemejia/beam/issues) and in Beam upstream (see issue links in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-160)\r\n\r\nHere is a doc that present NexMark components and pseudo code of the queries to ease the review : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VgnGiVu8vSfm7Et-xAtQYv0PlEpqeyfmhpQUNPmWRJs \r\n\r\nEverything needed to launch the queries is in the Readme. There is also a support matrix towards the runners.\r\n\r\nPlease do not squash commits because there are several authors Mark, Ismaël and I.\r\n\r\nGood review :)
