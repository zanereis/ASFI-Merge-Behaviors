https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4016 and https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4177\r\n- Incrementally handoff segments when they hit maxRowsPerSegment limit\r\n- Decouple segment partitioning from Kafka partitioning, all records from consumed partitions go to a single druid segment\r\n- Decouple publishing of segments from waiting for handoff\r\n- Support for restoring task on middle manager restarts by check pointing end offsets for segments\r\n\r\nDesign - \r\n- Introduce `DriverHolder` that has start and end offsets and thus represents the Kafka records that the `FiniteAppenderatorDriver` it wraps should consume. Each `DriverHolder` has a unique sequence name which is concatenation of the baseSequenceName of the task and a suffix of linearly increasing `DriverHolder` index. Similarly, the persist directory for each holder is concatenation of basePersistDir of the task and the holder index.\r\n- When a new task starts, a new `DriverHolder` is created with start and end offsets of the task.\r\n- All records consumed from assigned partitions are given to a `DriverHolder` that can handle it.\r\n- As soon as the number of records consumed hit the `maxRowsInSegment` limit the task pauses and Supervisor is sent `CheckPointDataSourceMetadataAction` which pauses all replica tasks, gets the highest offset for all partitions, store these partition offsets as a check point in the metadata store for the baseSequenceName of the task. Then sends the check point to all replica tasks using `setEndOffset` call with `finish` query param as `false` indicating that these are not the final end offsets for the task. The latest `DriverHolder` in the task updates its local end offsets to the check point and a new `DriverHolder` is created to handle records beyond this check point.\r\n- When a `DriverHolder` has consumed till its end offsets, it is submitted to a `persistExecService` which persists the driver and then adds the driver to a `publishQueue`. Another, executor service named `publishExecService` takes the driver from the `publishQueue` and tries to push and publish the segments to deep storage and metadata store. After a successful publish the driver is added to `handOffQueue` and `handOffExecService` keeps on waiting for completion of hand off of the driver.\r\n- After ingestion loop is finished a `SentinelDriverHolder` is submitted to be persisted and published. When this `SentinelDriverHolder`  is done, the task ends.\r\n- For supporting restore on restart, the `DriverHolder` list is persisted every time a critical action happens like - a new holder is created, end offsets for a holder is set and a holder is removed from a list.\r\n- Each new task is sent a list of checkpoints for its baseSequenceName if one exists in the metadata store. This way if some task failed after check-pointing some holders and a new task is created in its place, it can get the same checkpoints. \r\n- At start of each task the persisted drivers list and checkpoints information is used to restore its state by creating `DriverHolder`s if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis code is currently running on our metrics cluster for few days without any issues. \r\nNote - ~~We do not run replicas on our metrics cluster.~~ Now running with 2 replicas since last few days.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- Add tests\r\n~~- Possibly test with replicas on real

one kafka ingestion task , if there is too much data(e.g. reset offset for a data source), it probably would NOT finish the publishing within the time of `completionTimeout(default:30Mins)`.\r\nIn this case, I found that it did put the data into HDFS(deep storage), but it lost the meta-data because the KafkaIndexTask thread was interrupted, it's caught by line538(540), in this catch block, it does NOT rethrow exception if it's the publishing timeout case, and finally, it finishes as a SUCCESSFUL task, but in fact, it lose the meta-data for these segments created by this task.\r\nIn this

PR adds a new expression type \"jq\" to the flattenSpec.  \"jq\" is a well known JSON manipulation tool.   JSONPath is ok for extracting values out of the nested data structure but it lacks value translation capability.   jq is pretty good at it and it can be used as ETL tool, effectively.\r\n\r\nExample:  a JSON has `secondField` and `nanosecField` fields where integer values are stored, and you want to extract the sum of the two fields, and get the derived field `totalSecond`.  Another example is to apply regex on URL and get directory name.  The flattenSpec can be written like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"flattenSpec\": {\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n      {\r\n         \"type\": \"jq\",\r\n         \"name\": \"totalSecond\",\r\n         \"expr\": \".secondField + .nanosecField / 1000000000\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"jq\",\r\n        \"name\": \"directory\",\r\n        \"expr\": \".url | capture(\\\"(?<dir>\\/[^\\/]+/\\\", \\\"\\\") | .dir)\"\r\n      } \r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benchmark that accesses nested fields shows no significant difference than JSONPath.\r\n\r\nJsonPath related code has been modified to use `JacksonJsonNodeJsonProvide`r and `JsonNode` instead of `JacksonJsonProvider` and `Map<String, Object>` so that both JsonPath and Jackson-JQ use the same JsonNode document.\r\n\r\nThe only ugly part is the newly added `FlattenExpr` adapter that wraps JsonPath and JsonQuery classes.  I'm not sure the best way to create a common interface for the 3rd party classes.  Please enlighten me if there is a better way.\r\n\r\nLastly, please note,  the jq library used in this PR is [jackson-jq](https://github.com/eiiches/jackson-jq) that is a Java port, not the [original jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) nor [libjq wrapper](https://github.com/bskaggs/jjq).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-14T02:38:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T21:31:07Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:18:35Z","merged_at":"2017-09-12T19:18:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0be050242302b8198b66140316e50e8f8374275","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/23/labels","id":2338417,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjMzODQxNw==","number":23,"title":"0.11.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":273,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-21T17:48:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T00:20:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-12-05T15:32:25Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/79c7baaf82c38979aefd26122832771cb5c74380","head":{"label":"knoguchi:add-jq-expr","ref":"add-jq-expr","sha":"79c7baaf82c38979aefd26122832771cb5c74380","user":{"login":"knoguchi","id":127546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzU0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi","html_url":"https://github.com/knoguchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56892648,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Njg5MjY0OA==","name":"druid","full_name":"knoguchi/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"knoguchi","id":127546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzU0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi","html_url":"https://github.com/knoguchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knoguchi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/knoguchi/druid","description":"Column

- Don't use locks in `ReferenceCountingSegment`.\r\n - Behaviour of `ReferenceCountingSegment.close()` was unsafe, it was able to \"steal\" a valid reference of other Segment's accessor. Because `ReferenceCountingSegment.isClosed` flag is set only when \"there are no more references\" to the baseSegment. So it was able to call `ReferenceCountingSegment.close()` twice and it would decrement reference count twice and close the baseSegment, even if there are active accessors (via `increment()`).\r\n - Don't use locks in `FireHydrant`.\r\n - Some uses of `FireHydrant` were unsafe because they didn't acquire reference to Segment while querying/processing it.

https://travis-ci.org/druid-io/druid/builds/216981438).\r\nThe fail logs indicate the test hangs on the [same line](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/server/src/test/java/io/druid/server/coordinator/DruidCoordinatorTest.java#L375). On that line, the code waits until the replication status of a data source is changed to some value, but actually it is never changed because the map checked in the loop contains snapshot values. \r\nI'm currently suspecting the hang is caused by some zookeeper related problems, but not sure. So, I improved the test to show the cause of failure. It will be helpful to figure out what is the root cause.\r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\r\n---\r\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

patch for #4032. \r\n\r\nHere are the highlights of the changes.\r\n* Extended ```Query``` to be able to have multiple data sources.  \r\n* Added ```JoinQuery```\r\n* Added a new method ```annotateDistributionTarget``` to ```QueryToolChest```. ```CachingClusteredClient``` can figure out which data source is the target of query distribution when choosing nodes for query processing.\r\n* ```DimensionSpec``` is changed to have an optional dataSource name field. Another option for this is to force the name of ```DimensionSpec``` to always be prefixed with its dataSource name like ```'foo.dim1'```. I think this is error-prone, and thus the former option is better.\r\n*  Currently, metrics are represented as a list of simple strings, so they must be forced to be prefixed their dataSource names. However, in the future, I think we need a new data structure for metrics like ```DimensionSpec```, or extend ```DimensionSpec``` to cover metrics as well. (It's possible because it now supports long and double columns.) \r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\r\n---\r\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

checking maxId behavior is weird, We can get dims array from cursor's currEntry in IndexerDimensionSelector, but choosing to ignore the dims if dims are beyond maxId which is actually too old if data arrives after the cursor is made and cursor can retrieve really new data when the new data is inside the cursor's interval.\r\nBut think about this case, a group by query may produces aggregator values with empty string dimensions, while actually these aggregator values should bound to some non-empty dimensions.\r\n\r\n--update\r\nthe reason why maxId check is needed is explained here

Factor out ProtoBuf parser from `processing` module to `extensions-contrib/protobuf-extensions`\r\n2. Migrate ProtoBuf from v2 to v3\r\n3. Add flattenSpec support.\r\n4. Support composite (nested) message types.  Original implementation had an assumption that the descriptor file contains one message type only.  [See this line](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/io/druid/data/input/ProtoBufInputRowParser.java#L120).  In order to specify the message type, I added a mandatory key `protoMessageType`.\r\n5. Load the descriptor file from a URL as well as classpath.  Original implementation expected the descriptor file in the classpath.   It was inconvenient when using with the Kafka indexing service that can create indexing jobs dynamically.\r\n\r\nThe com.google.protobuf package might need shading because some part of Druid is still using protobuf 2.5.0.

the current auto reset implementation (https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3842) whenever a task sends a reset request for a stuck partition, the supervisor kills all the replica tasks and starts new set of tasks. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this means that all the data that has been consumed by the task for stuck partition will be lost and for non stuck partition it would need to be consumed again by new set of tasks. This is problematic because suddenly data that was being served is not present anymore and also the consumption progress made on non stuck partitions is lost.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a best efforts to improve the situation, when supervisor gets a reset request it will let the task with most consumed data publish and kill other replicas. The publishing task will only update the offset information in dataSourceMetadata for non stuck partitions and supervisor already removes the offset info about stuck partitions so that it can be fetched from Kafka for new set of
