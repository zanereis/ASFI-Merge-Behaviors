change makes it so that certain operations in the scheduler are\ncalled on a regular interval, instead of only once at start up, or every\ntime around the loop:\n\n- adopt_or_reset_orphaned_tasks (detecting SchedulerJobs that died) was\n  previously only called on start up.\n- _clean_tis_without_dagrun was previously called every time around the\n  scheduling loop, but this isn't so needed to be done every time as\n  this is a relatively rare cleanup operation\n- _emit_pool_metrics doesn't need to be called _every_ time around the\n  loop, once every 5 seconds is enough.\n\nThis uses the built in [\"sched\" module][sched] to handle the \"timers\".\n\n[sched]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

Airflow version**: 1.10.12\r\n\r\n\r\n**Kubernetes version (if you are using kubernetes)** (use `kubectl version`):\r\n\r\n**Environment**:  CentOS 7/Python 3.7\r\n\r\n- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**:\r\n- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release):\r\n- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`):\r\n- **Install tools**:\r\n- **Others**:\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nWhen starting a Docker container using DockerOperator, where the container exits immediately, the Airflow task hangs indefinitely. Related to https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/2087\r\n\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nThe DockerOperator should terminate if the corresponding Docker container already stopped.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce it**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.docker_operator import DockerOperator\r\n\r\ndummy_DAG = DAG(\"Dummy\", default_args={\r\n    \"start_date\": \"2020-11-04 12:00:00\"\r\n}, schedule_interval=\"* * * * *\")\r\n\r\npython_sleep_operator = DockerOperator(\r\n    image=\"python:3.7\",\r\n    command=\"python3 -c \\\"import taime; time.sleep(5); print('SUCCESS')\\\"\",  # this typo is indeed intended.\r\n    task_id=\"sleepy\",\r\n    dag=dummy_DAG,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know**:\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the concrete issue is that `APIClient.attach(stream=True)` waits for any output, but as the container has stopped, there won't be any. Curiously, `docker attach someStoppedContainer` on the command line fails with an according error message, but the Python client's call does not, but it simply waits, causing the Airflow task to hang indefinitely.\r\n\r\nMy proposal simply is to exchange `APIClient.attach` with `APIClient.logs`, as we do not necessarily have to attach to the container (which allows bidirectional data exchange), but only want to read `stdout` and `stderr`. Furthermore, `APIClient.logs` is able to \"stream\" all output logs from an exited container, whereas `APIClient.attach(stream=True)` waits for output from that *exited*

change #10806 made airflow works with implicit packages\r\nwhen \"airflow\" got imported. This is a good change, however\r\nit has some unforeseen consequences.

Expected behaviour\r\nFor a sensor like this, the intention of the DAG author is usually to fail the sensor if it's still not done after ten minutes. However, if the sensor fails prematurely due to other unexpected reasons (such as network outage), retry at most twice.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsensor = PythonSensor(\r\n    task_id='sensor',\r\n    python_callable=python_callable,\r\n    timeout=60 * 10,\r\n    retries=2,\r\n    mode=\"reschedule\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour\r\nThe actual current behaviour of Airflow is to retry when the sensor times out. So the effective timeout of the sensor becomes 60 * 10 * (retries + 1) = 30min. This often causes confusion. It also makes it impossible to achieve the expected behaviour no matter how the author configures the sensor.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nThis PR fixes this issue. `AirflowSensorTimeout` is now treated as immediate failure. This achieves the expected behaviour. The sensor will fail if timeout is reached. If someone really wants the previous behaviour, he can always increase the timeout. I.e instead of failing and retrying every ten minutes three times, just set the timeout to 30min.","created_at":"2020-11-03T04:52:06Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T08:46:55Z","closed_at":"2021-05-29T17:11:56Z","merged_at":"2021-05-29T17:11:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0e6a847aa72ddb15bdc147695273fb3aec8839d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect

PR addresses #11911 and adds support for replacing an existing table when using the BigQueryCreateEmptyTableOperator. \r\n\r\nIt is a currently a WIP. Things that still need to be addressed:\r\n1. Test coverage, there's a preliminary test for what I think should be tested but it needs some style guidance\r\n2. Documentation updates\r\n\r\nThere are two commits for now but once the points above are resolved I will squash everything to a single commit 👍 \r\n\r\n@manesioz I know you wanted to work on this one too so please feel free to help out and we can co-author this one!\r\n\r\n@turbaszek I tried to follow the suggestion you left on the related issue, let me know what you

if all the libraries `EXTRAS_REQUIREMENTS` section in `setup.py` are documented in the `installation.rst` file.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nChecking if these two files are in sync is tricky cos there is a lot of freedom in how `setup.py` is documented. Entries in `EXTRAS_REQUIREMENTS` can take these forms:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'name': name,\r\n'alias': name\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the documentation, this can be reflected as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n| name       | ``pip install 'apache-airflow[alias]'`|\r\n| alias      | ``pip install 'apache-airflow[name]'` |\r\n| name       | ``pip install 'apache-airflow[name]'` |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe algorithm used is not strict:\r\n\r\n1. In the first round, it checks if either packaged name from `setup.py` or any of its aliases is present in the second column in the `installation.rst` file.\r\n2. In the second round, it checks if a name listed in the second column in `installation.rst` is listed as a name or alias in the `setup.py` file.\r\n\r\n### Warning\r\n\r\nThere are differences between these two files. I fixed them to be able to commit the changes. But these packages documentation should be updated:\r\n\r\n* pagerduty\r\n* plexus\r\n* sentry\r\n* singularity\r\n* tableau\r\n* virtualenv\r\n\r\ncloses:

improve the request JSON key check in `PATCH` and `POST` endpoints for **Pool** in `/api_connextion`.\r\n\r\nThe main reasoning is:\r\n\r\nIf I miss *both* required properties (`name` and `slots`) in my request, I receive only one warning at one time.\r\nThat means I need to fix my error for twice, which is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThis commit helps check all missing properties in one shot.\r\n\r\n(I'm not abstracting this into a util method/function because so far I only see two such usage in whole repo).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change adds even more aggressive cancelling of duplicates of\r\n'Build Image' jobs. it's not an obvious task to know which\r\nBuild Image jobs are duplicates, we are matching those duplicates\r\nbased on specially crafted \"build-info\" job names. We add\r\nEvent, Branch, Repo to the job names and assume that two\r\nruns with the same event + branch + repo are duplicates.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately even this will not work perfectly well. Those job\r\nnames are resolved only for the jobs that are runnning rather than\r\nthe queued ones, so in case we have several duplicates of the\r\nsame build image job in the queue, they will not be found/cancelled.\r\nThe cancelling will only happen if both duplicates are already\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nIt's good enough for now and we cannot do much more until there\r\nis a missing feature added to GitHub API that allows to link\r\nthe workflow_run with the run that triggered it. This issue has\r\nbeen raised to GitHub Support and internal engineering ticket\r\nhas been apparently opened to add this feature.\r\n\r\nMore detailed status for the missing feature is kept at #11294\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
