href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">org.graalvm.js:js's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>GraalVM JavaScript (Graal.js) Changelog</h1>\n<p>This changelog summarizes major changes between GraalVM versions of the GraalVM JavaScript (ECMAScript) language runtime.\nThe main focus is on user-observable behavior of the engine.\nChangelog may include unreleased versions.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/release-calendar/\">release calendar</a> for release dates.</p>\n<h2>Version 23.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>NOTE: GraalVM no longer ships with a &quot;js&quot; ScriptEngine. Please either use the Maven dependency or explicitly put <code>js-scriptengine.jar</code> on the module path. See <a href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/docs/user/ScriptEngine.md\">ScriptEngine documentation</a> for details.</li>\n<li>ECMAScript 2023 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context\">Async Context</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.async-context</code>.</li>\n<li><code>FinalizationRegistry.prototype.cleanupSome</code> is not enabled by default any more; it has been moved to ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.allow-narrow-spaces-in-date-format</code> (enabled by default). When this option is set to <code>false</code> then narrow spaces in date/time formats are replaced by a space (<code>0x20</code>).</li>\n<li>Made option <code>js.console</code> stable and allowed in <code>SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED</code>.</li>\n<li>Made option <code>js.unhandled-rejections</code> stable and allowed in <code>SandboxPolicy.CONSTRAINED</code>.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>js.allow-eval</code> that is stable and allowed in <code>SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED</code>.</li>\n<li>Deprecated option <code>js.disable-eval</code>, superseded by <code>js.allow-eval</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-string-dedent\">String.dedent</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Duplicate named capture groups are now supported in regular expressions, as per the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups\">duplicate named capturing groups</a> proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 23.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types\">WebAssembly reference types</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers\">Iterator Helpers</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.iterator-helpers</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm\">ShadowRealm</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.shadow-realm</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>v8-legacy-const</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed non-standard <code>SharedArrayBuffer.isView</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 18.14.1.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys\">Symbols as WeakMap keys</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-transfer\">ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer and friends</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy\">Change Array by copy</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Added BigInteger interop support.\nNote that foreign BigIntegers require an explicit type cast using the <code>BigInt</code> function to opt into JS BigInt semantics.\nThe default semantics is to treat all foreign numbers like JS Number values, regardless of the original value or type.\nArithmetic operators perform an implicit lossy conversion to double; mixing a JS BigInt with any non-JS number always throws.\nComparison operators attempt to do a precise value comparison where possible.\nJS BigInt values can now be converted to <code>java.math.BigInteger</code> host objects, although a <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/HostAccess.Builder.html#targetTypeMapping-java.lang.Class-java.lang.Class-java.util.function.Predicate-java.util.function.Function-\">target type mapping</a> may still be necessary to ensure consistent type mapping if the target type is ambiguous or absent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value\">WebAssembly multi-value</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.unhandled-rejections=handler</code> that allows to use a custom callback to track unhandled promise rejections.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.17.1.</li>\n<li>ECMA-402 Internationalization API has been enabled by default. It can be disabled by <code>--js.intl-402=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators\">Decorators (stage 3)</a> proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GraalVM JavaScript is now an installable component of GraalVM. It can be installed with <code>gu install js</code>.</li>\n<li>Enabled option <code>js.foreign-object-prototype</code> by default.

Please either use the Maven dependency or explicitly put <code>js-scriptengine.jar</code> on the module path. See <a href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/docs/user/ScriptEngine.md\">ScriptEngine documentation</a> for details.</li>\n<li>ECMAScript 2023 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context\">Async Context</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.async-context</code>.</li>\n<li><code>FinalizationRegistry.prototype.cleanupSome</code> is not enabled by default any more; it has been moved to ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.allow-narrow-spaces-in-date-format</code> (enabled by default). When this option is set to <code>false</code> then narrow spaces in date/time formats are replaced by a space (<code>0x20</code>).</li>\n<li>Made option <code>js.console</code> stable and allowed in <code>SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED</code>.</li>\n<li>Made option <code>js.unhandled-rejections</code> stable and allowed in <code>SandboxPolicy.CONSTRAINED</code>.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>js.allow-eval</code> that is stable and allowed in <code>SandboxPolicy.UNTRUSTED</code>.</li>\n<li>Deprecated option <code>js.disable-eval</code>, superseded by <code>js.allow-eval</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-string-dedent\">String.dedent</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Duplicate named capture groups are now supported in regular expressions, as per the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups\">duplicate named capturing groups</a> proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 23.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types\">WebAssembly reference types</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers\">Iterator Helpers</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.iterator-helpers</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm\">ShadowRealm</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.shadow-realm</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>v8-legacy-const</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed non-standard <code>SharedArrayBuffer.isView</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 18.14.1.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys\">Symbols as WeakMap keys</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-transfer\">ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer and friends</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy\">Change Array by copy</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Added BigInteger interop support.\nNote that foreign BigIntegers require an explicit type cast using the <code>BigInt</code> function to opt into JS BigInt semantics.\nThe default semantics is to treat all foreign numbers like JS Number values, regardless of the original value or type.\nArithmetic operators perform an implicit lossy conversion to double; mixing a JS BigInt with any non-JS number always throws.\nComparison operators attempt to do a precise value comparison where possible.\nJS BigInt values can now be converted to <code>java.math.BigInteger</code> host objects, although a <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/HostAccess.Builder.html#targetTypeMapping-java.lang.Class-java.lang.Class-java.util.function.Predicate-java.util.function.Function-\">target type mapping</a> may still be necessary to ensure consistent type mapping if the target type is ambiguous or absent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value\">WebAssembly multi-value</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.unhandled-rejections=handler</code> that allows to use a custom callback to track unhandled promise rejections.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.17.1.</li>\n<li>ECMA-402 Internationalization API has been enabled by default. It can be disabled by <code>--js.intl-402=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators\">Decorators (stage 3)</a> proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GraalVM JavaScript is now an installable component of GraalVM. It can be installed with <code>gu install js</code>.</li>\n<li>Enabled option <code>js.foreign-object-prototype</code> by default. Polyglot Interop objects now get a fitting JavaScript prototype assigned unless explicitly turned off using this flag.</li>\n<li>Added intermediate prototype for foreign objects to simplify adapting functionality.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated experimental option <code>experimental-foreign-object-prototype</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>commonjs-global-properties</code>.

Sorry again for the trouble. If you use Gradle, please still read <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.1.0\">the release notes from that version</a>: You may still see errors from the new checking that the metadata enables, and the release notes discuss how to fix those errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>32.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Warning: Gradle metadata is broken. Read these notes, but skip to 32.1.1</h3>\n<p>We made a mistake in our release script, so the new Gradle metadata (discussed below) is <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6612\">broken</a> in 32.1.0. Sorry for the trouble and for the need for another quick patch release. We recommend upgrading straight to release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.1.1\">32.1.1</a>, especially if you use Gradle or if you publish a library whose users might use Gradle. Still, read the release notes below if you use Gradle, since the fixed Gradle metadata in 32.1.1 may still require action on your part.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;32.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

standard compliant, execute applications with high performance, and provide all benefits from the GraalVM stack, including language interoperability and common tooling.</p>\n<p>More information is available on the GraalVM website:\n<a href=\"http://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/js/\">http://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/js/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">js's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 23.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types\">WebAssembly reference types</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers\">Iterator Helpers</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.iterator-helpers</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm\">ShadowRealm</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.shadow-realm</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>v8-legacy-const</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed non-standard <code>SharedArrayBuffer.isView</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 18.14.1.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys\">Symbols as WeakMap keys</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-transfer\">ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer and friends</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy\">Change Array by copy</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Added BigInteger interop support.\nNote that foreign BigIntegers require an explicit type cast using the <code>BigInt</code> function to opt into JS BigInt semantics.\nThe default semantics is to treat all foreign numbers like JS Number values, regardless of the original value or type.\nArithmetic operators perform an implicit lossy conversion to double; mixing a JS BigInt with any non-JS number always throws.\nComparison operators attempt to do a precise value comparison where possible.\nJS BigInt values can now be converted to <code>java.math.BigInteger</code> host objects, although a <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/HostAccess.Builder.html#targetTypeMapping-java.lang.Class-java.lang.Class-java.util.function.Predicate-java.util.function.Function-\">target type mapping</a> may still be necessary to ensure consistent type mapping if the target type is ambiguous or absent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value\">WebAssembly multi-value</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.unhandled-rejections=handler</code> that allows to use a custom callback to track unhandled promise rejections.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.17.1.</li>\n<li>ECMA-402 Internationalization API has been enabled by default. It can be disabled by <code>--js.intl-402=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators\">Decorators (stage 3)</a> proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GraalVM JavaScript is now an installable component of GraalVM. It can be installed with <code>gu install js</code>.</li>\n<li>Enabled option <code>js.foreign-object-prototype</code> by default. Polyglot Interop objects now get a fitting JavaScript prototype assigned unless explicitly turned off using this flag.</li>\n<li>Added intermediate prototype for foreign objects to simplify adapting functionality.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated experimental option <code>experimental-foreign-object-prototype</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>commonjs-global-properties</code>. The same functionality can be achieved in user code with a direct call to <code>require()</code> after context creation.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.zone-rules-based-time-zones</code> that allows to use timezone-related data from <code>ZoneRulesProvider</code> (instead of ICU4J data files).</li>\n<li>Temporal objects can be converted to compatible Java objects when possible, using the <code>Value</code> API's methods like <code>asDate()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.</li>\n<li>Graal.js now requires Java 11+ and no longer supports Java 8.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3\">Intl.NumberFormat v3</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping\">Array Grouping v3</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal\">Temporal</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.temporal</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last\">Array Find from Last</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Optimized closures to only keep references on variables in the lexical environment that are needed by (one or more) closures. This optimization can be disabled with the experimental option <code>--js.scope-optimization=false</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved the internal string representation to the new TruffleString type.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>--js.string-lazy-substrings</code> (default: true) to allow toggling the copying behavior of string slices. When enabled, string slices internally create string views instead of copying the given string region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ECMAScript 2022 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/intl-displaynames-v2\">Intl.DisplayNames v2</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info\">Intl Locale Info</a> proposal.

It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.iterator-helpers</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm\">ShadowRealm</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.shadow-realm</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>v8-legacy-const</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed non-standard <code>SharedArrayBuffer.isView</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 18.14.1.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys\">Symbols as WeakMap keys</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-transfer\">ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer and friends</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy\">Change Array by copy</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Added BigInteger interop support.\nNote that foreign BigIntegers require an explicit type cast using the <code>BigInt</code> function to opt into JS BigInt semantics.\nThe default semantics is to treat all foreign numbers like JS Number values, regardless of the original value or type.\nArithmetic operators perform an implicit lossy conversion to double; mixing a JS BigInt with any non-JS number always throws.\nComparison operators attempt to do a precise value comparison where possible.\nJS BigInt values can now be converted to <code>java.math.BigInteger</code> host objects, although a <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/HostAccess.Builder.html#targetTypeMapping-java.lang.Class-java.lang.Class-java.util.function.Predicate-java.util.function.Function-\">target type mapping</a> may still be necessary to ensure consistent type mapping if the target type is ambiguous or absent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value\">WebAssembly multi-value</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.unhandled-rejections=handler</code> that allows to use a custom callback to track unhandled promise rejections.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.17.1.</li>\n<li>ECMA-402 Internationalization API has been enabled by default. It can be disabled by <code>--js.intl-402=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators\">Decorators (stage 3)</a> proposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GraalVM JavaScript is now an installable component of GraalVM. It can be installed with <code>gu install js</code>.</li>\n<li>Enabled option <code>js.foreign-object-prototype</code> by default. Polyglot Interop objects now get a fitting JavaScript prototype assigned unless explicitly turned off using this flag.</li>\n<li>Added intermediate prototype for foreign objects to simplify adapting functionality.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated experimental option <code>experimental-foreign-object-prototype</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>commonjs-global-properties</code>. The same functionality can be achieved in user code with a direct call to <code>require()</code> after context creation.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.zone-rules-based-time-zones</code> that allows to use timezone-related data from <code>ZoneRulesProvider</code> (instead of ICU4J data files).</li>\n<li>Temporal objects can be converted to compatible Java objects when possible, using the <code>Value</code> API's methods like <code>asDate()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.</li>\n<li>Graal.js now requires Java 11+ and no longer supports Java 8.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3\">Intl.NumberFormat v3</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping\">Array Grouping v3</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal\">Temporal</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.temporal</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last\">Array Find from Last</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Optimized closures to only keep references on variables in the lexical environment that are needed by (one or more) closures. This optimization can be disabled with the experimental option <code>--js.scope-optimization=false</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved the internal string representation to the new TruffleString type.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>--js.string-lazy-substrings</code> (default: true) to allow toggling the copying behavior of string slices. When enabled, string slices internally create string views instead of copying the given string region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ECMAScript 2022 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/intl-displaynames-v2\">Intl.DisplayNames v2</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info\">Intl Locale Info</a> proposal.

in-memory, general-purpose, non-transactional graphs as successors of GraphMem: All variants strictly use term-equality and do not support Iterator#remove. (GraphMem uses value-equality for object nodes)\r\n\r\nGraphMem2Legacy:\r\n- Purpose: Use this graph implementation if you want to maintain the 'old' behavior of GraphMem or if your memory constraints prevent you from utilizing more memory-intensive solutions.\r\n- Slightly improved performance compared to GraphMem\r\n- Simplified implementation, primarily due to lack of support for Iterator#remove\r\n- The heritage of GraphMem:\r\n  - Same basic structure\r\n  - Same memory consumption\r\n- Also based on HashCommon\r\n\r\nGraphMem2Fast:\r\n- Purpose: GraphMem2Fast is a strong candidate for becoming the new default in-memory graph in the upcoming Jena 5, thanks to its improved performance and relatively minor increase in memory usage.\r\n- Faster than GraphMem2Legacy (specially Graph#add, Graph#find and Graph#stream)\r\n- Memory consumption is about 6-35% higher than GraphMem2Legacy\r\n- Maps and sets are not based on HashCommon, but use a faster custom alternative (only #remove is a bit slower)\r\n- Benefits from multiple small optimizations\r\n- The heritage of GraphMem:\r\n  - Also uses 3 hash-maps indexed by subjects, predicates, and objects\r\n  - Values of the maps also switch from arrays to hash sets for the triples\r\n\r\nGraphMem2Roaring\r\n- Purpose: GraphMem2Roaring is ideal for handling extremely large graphs. If you frequently work with such massive data structures, this implementation could be your top choice.\r\n- Graph#contains is faster than GraphMem2Fast\r\n- Better performance than GraphMem2Fast for operations with triple matches for the pattern S_O, SP_, and _PO on large graphs, due to bit-operations to find intersecting triples\r\n- Memory consumption is about 7-99% higher than GraphMem2Legacy\r\n- Suitable for really large graphs like bsbm-5m.nt.gz, bsbm-25m.nt.gz, and possibly even larger\r\n- Simple and straightforward implementation\r\n- No heritage of GraphMem\r\n- Internal structure:\r\n  - One indexed hash set (same as GraphMem2Fast uses) that holds all triples\r\n  - Three hash maps indexed by subjects, predicates, and objects with RoaringBitmaps as values\r\n  - The bitmaps contain the indices of the triples in the central hash set\r\n\r\nOther Changes:\r\n- org.apache.jena.graph.test.TestGraph\r\n  - added GraphMem2Fast, GraphMem2Legacy and GraphMem2Roaring to the suite\r\n- GraphMem:\r\n  - moved property \"TripleStore store\" from GraphMemBase to GraphMem --> needed this to make a clean GraphMem2, which also extends GraphMem but the TripleStore interface is slightly different.\r\n- pom.xml:\r\n  - added dependency roaringbitmap 0.9.44\r\n- jena-benchmarks-jmh\r\n  - added the three new graph implementations to the benchmarks\r\n  - randomized the order of test data in some benchmarks to prevent them from showing order dependent behaviour\r\n  - added benchmarks for sets and maps comparing\r\n    - HashCommonSet vs. FastHashSet vs. Java HashSet\r\n    - HashCommonMap vs. FastHashMap vs. Java HashMap\r\n\r\nGitHub issue resolved #1912\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [X] Tests are included.\r\n - [X] Documentation change and updates are

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">CVE-2020-8908</a> and [Guava issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">google/guava#2575</a>) (CVE-2023-2976, forthcoming). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, we expect no problems for anyone except Windows users. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to potentially regress support.)</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>A few changes could cause isses for users in relatively rare situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>. (b30e73cfa81ad15c1023c17cfd083255a3df0105)</li>\n<li>This release removes various APIs from the <code>guava-gwt</code>. This affects only users of <a href=\"https://www.gwtproject.org/\">GWT</a>. The APIs we removed are <code>Enums</code>, <code>Sets.complementOf</code>, and the <code>Enum*BiMap</code> classes' <code>keyType()</code> and <code>valueType()</code> methods. These changes prepare for the removal of reflective enum-related APIs from <a href=\"https://github.com/google/j2cl\">J2CL</a>. If one of these changes causes you problems as a GWT user, let us know.

issue resolved #1889\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nMoves `adduser` to final layer only (we were creating and then copying `/etc/passwd`). Runs `addgroup` before, and uses a fixed uid/gid for user and group.\r\n\r\nCreate base directory, changes ownership, and then switches to the Jena user in Docker. That creates everything else with the correct uid/gid/ownership.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [ ] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena

issue resolved #1872\r\nGitHub issue resolved #1881\r\n\r\nThis PR tracks the work done to develop the SPARQL 1.2 language grammar.\r\n\r\nThis is the `Syntax.syntaxSPARQL_12` parser language in Jena. It is not the default parser, which is the ARQ language - SPARQL with some extensions and efficiency re-writes specifically to suit JavaCC.\r\n\r\nThe Working Group material is definitive.\r\n\r\nThis PR is draft until the WG merges the initial update of the SPARQL grammar.

issue resolved #1279: Improve the implementation of in-memory, general-purpose, non-transactional graphs.\r\n\r\nPull Request Description:\r\n- Improved performance of GraphMem for: Graph#find, Graph#stream, Graph#contains\r\n- The performance improvement partly stems from implementing Iterator#forEachRemaining (new since Java 8) for many iterators and helpers\r\n- Introduced a new module for benchmarks, especially JMH benchmarks, and prepared for regression tests against previous releases. This allows the impact of the changes to be evaluated.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nMy work on an alternative to GraphMem is progressing slowly. Some of my performance improvements, when compared to GraphMem, stem from Iterator and Spliterator implementations. Since I mainly work with sparse arrays, I was able to apply some of my work directly to GraphMem and its helper classes. \r\nTo avoid any negative impact from my work, it was necessary to compare the performance of the tuned GraphMem with the previous release. So, I restructured my JMH benchmarks and added them to the project. Now, anyone can easily evaluate the impact on their specific graph. The new modules also enable other developers to easily add their JMH tests or regression tests to Jena.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSummary of first commit:\r\n- Improved performance of GraphMem for:\r\n  - Graph#find\r\n    - Slightly by tuning the filter predicates\r\n    - Significantly when results are processed via Iterator#forEachRemaining\r\n  - Graph#stream\r\n    - Slightly by tuning the filter predicates\r\n    - Significantly for most stream operations\r\n    - java.util.stream.BaseStream#parallel is now fully supported.\r\n      (Before these changes, parallel execution was even slower than single-threaded execution)\r\n  - Graph#contains\r\n    - Only for non-concrete (fluent) patterns\r\n- GraphMem used a variety of different Iterator implementations, helper classes, and wrappers:\r\n  -> None of them supported #forEachRemaining\r\n  -> It seemed appropriate to almost universally implement #forEachRemaining to avoid a wrapper or helper\r\n     from breaking the newly gained performance advantages of #forEachRemaining\r\n\r\nSummary of second commit:\r\n- new module: jena-benchmarks, with two sub-modules:\r\n  - jena-benchmarks-shadedJena480\r\n    - This module wraps some dependencies from the Apache Jena Release 4.8.0\r\n    - The wrapped module is used to implement regression tests against older releases\r\n  - jena-benchmarks-jmh\r\n    - contains JMH benchmarks for different Graph operations\r\n      - Allows for the comparison of the performance of different Graph implementations and different releases of the same implementation\r\n    - contains JMH benchmarks for SparseArraySpliterator and SparseArraySubSpliterator \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDetails of first commit:\r\n\r\nImplemented Iterator#forEachRemaining in an optimized way for many iterators throughout the Jena project:\r\n- Replaced hasNext();next(); calls by #forEachRemaining in some promising places (not all)\r\n\r\nOptimized NiceIterator:\r\n- NiceIterator#hasNext now avoids redundant calls to current.hasNext()\r\n- NiceIterator#andThen has optimized code to handle expensive hasNext calls of wrapped iterators.\r\n\r\nTuned GraphMem:\r\n- Removed unused classes in the 'mem' namespace: \r\n  - GraphMemTripleStore, NodeToTripleMap, SetBunch and WrappedHashMap\r\n- Iterators:\r\n  - Tuned Iterator implementations, mainly by adding forEachRemaining implementations\r\n  - Optimized code in BasicKeyIterator. The new iterator works in reverse order, so I had to adapt HashCommon#removeFrom\r\n  - Optimized code in HashedBunchMap#iterator\r\n  - TrackingTripleIterator#forEachRemaining now simply calls super.forEachRemaining() and sets current to null\r\n    -> This had a significant impact on performance\r\n- Spliterators:\r\n  - Created specialized spliterators SparseArraySpliterator and SparseArraySubSpliterator (+unit tests)\r\n  - Replaced Spliterator implementation within HashCommon and HashedBunchMap with SparseArraySpliterator\r\n  - Implemented Spliterators to support fast stream operations, where the SparseSpliterator*\r\n    implementations were not suitable\r\n- Replaced usage of org.apache.jena.graph.impl.GraphBase#containsByFind with optimized implementations:\r\n  - Introduced org.apache.jena.graph.impl.TripleStore#containsMatch\r\n  - Implemented org.apache.jena.mem.NodeToTriplesMapBase#containsMatch using the spliterator\r\n\r\n- Filter operations:\r\n  - Introduced org.apache.jena.graph.Triple.Field#filterOnConcrete to avoid double-checking of Node#isConcrete (+unit tests)\r\n  - Created org.apache.jena.mem.FieldFilter to efficiently build filter predicates only when needed, and only with\r\n    the required conditions (+unit tests)\r\n  - Used org.apache.jena.mem.FieldFilter#filterOn in NodeToTriplesMap#iterator, NodeToTriplesMapBase#stream,\r\n    and NodeToTriplesMapBase#containsMatch to only filter when a filter is needed.\r\n    For example: For find(sub, ANY, ANY), there is no need for a filter in the underlying TripleBunch\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLatests Bechmarks:\r\nJDK 17.0.7, OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, 17.0.7+7 -Xmx12G\r\nNotice: \r\n- The Legend unfortunately hides the corresponding release of GraphMem. It is always this PR (Rows 1, 3, 5) vs. Jena 4.8.0 (Rows 2, 4, 6).\r\n- The scale is logarithmic since the first two sample graphs (cheeses-0.1.ttl and pizza.owl.rdf) are very small compared to the third graph (bsbm-1m.nt.gz)\r\n\r\nGraph#contains with fluent (non-concrete) triples:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/c7a8b771-4331-4560-9152-0e3a6cc9f69d)\r\n\r\nGraph#find
