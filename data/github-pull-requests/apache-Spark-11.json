What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the EXTEND operator.\r\n\r\nThis operator preserves the existing input table and adds one or more new computed columns  whose values are equal to evaluating the specified expressions. This is equivalent to `SELECT *, <newExpressions>` in the SQL compiler. It is provided as a convenience feature and some functionality overlap exists with lateral column aliases.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING CSV;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 'abc'), (1, 'def');\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> EXTEND x + LENGTH(y) AS z;\r\n\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|  x |   y |   z |\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|  0 | abc |   3 |\r\n|  1 | def |   4 |\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike the `|> SELECT` operator, aggregate functions are not allowed in these expressions. During the course of developing reasonable error messages for this, I found that the SQL pipe syntax research paper also specified that the `|> AGGREGATE` operator should require that each non-grouping expression contains at least one aggregate function; I added a check and reasonable error message for this case as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the secondary indexes that state variables with TTL use are at most the size of the corresponding state variable's primary index. This change will eliminate unnecessary work done during the cleanup of stateful variables with TTL. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThe `TransformWithState` operator (hereon out known as \"TWS\") will allow users write procedural logic over streams of records. To store state between micro-batches, Spark will provide users _stateful variables_, which persist between micro-batches. For example, you might want to emit an average of the past 5 records, every 5 records. You might only receive 2 records in the first micro-batch, so you have to _buffer_ these 2 records until you get 3 more in a subsequent batch.  TWS supports 3 different types of stateful variables: single values, lists, and maps.\r\n\r\nThe TWS operator also supports stateful variables with Time To Live; this allows you to say, \"keep a certain record in state for `d` units of time\". This TTL is per-record. This means that every record in a list (or map) can expiry at a different point in time, depending on when the element in the list is inserted. A record inserted into a stateful list (or map) at time `t1` will expire at `t1 + d`, and a second that expires at `t2 + d` will expire at `t2 + d`. (For value state, there's only one value, so \"everything\" expires at the same time.)\r\n\r\nA very natural question to now ask is, how do we efficiently determine which elements have expired in the list, without having to do a full scan of every record in state? The idea here is to keep a secondary index from expiration timestamp, to the specific record that needs to be evicted. Not so hard, right?\r\n\r\n#### The state cleanup strategy today\r\n\r\nToday's cleanup strategy is about as simple as I indicated earlier: for every insert to a value/map/list, you:\r\n\r\n1. Write to the primary index\r\n2. Using the current timestamp, you write into the secondary index\r\n\r\nThe issue with this approach is that we do two _unconditional_ writes. This means that if the same state variable is written to with different timestamps, there will exist one element in the primary index, while there exists two elements in the secondary index. Consider the following example for a state variable `foo` with value `v1`, and TTL delay of 500:\r\n\r\nFor batch 0, `batchTimestampMs = 100`, `foo` updates to `v1`:\r\n\r\n- Primary index: `[foo -> (v1, 600)]`\r\n- Secondary index: `[(600, foo) -> EMPTY]`\r\n\r\nNote that the state variable is included in the secondary index key because we might have several elements with the same expiration timestamp; we want `(600, foo)` to not overwrite a `(600, bar)`, just because they both expire at 600.\r\n\r\nBatch 1: `batchTimestampMs = 200`, `foo` updates to `v2`.\r\n\r\nPrimary index: `[foo -> (v2, 700)]`\r\nSecondary index: `[(600, foo) -> EMPTY, (700, foo) -> EMPTY]`\r\n\r\nNow, we have two entries in our secondary index. If the current timestamp advanced to something like 800, we'd take the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. We'd take the first element from the secondary index `(600, foo)`, and lookup `foo` in the primary index. That would yield `(v2, 700)`. The value of 700 in the primary index is still less than 800, so we would remove `foo` from the primary index.\r\n2. Then, we would look at `(700, foo)`. We'd look up `foo` in the primary index and see nothing, so we'd do nothing.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice here that step 2 is _entirely_ redundant. We read `(700, foo)` and did a get to the primary index, for something that was doomed—it would have never returned anything.\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't great, the story is unfortunately significantly worse for lists. The way that we store lists is by having a single key in RocksDB, whose value is the concatenated bytes of all the values in that list. When we do cleanup for a list, we go through _all_ of its records and Thus, it's possible for us to have a list that looks something like:\r\n\r\n- Primary index: `[foo -> [(v1, 600), (v2, 700), (v3, 900)]]`\r\n- Secondary index: `[(600, foo) -> EMPTY, (700, foo) -> EMPTY, (900, foo) -> EMPTY]`\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that the current timestamp is 800. We need to expire the records in the list. So, we do the following:\r\n\r\n1. We take the first element from the secondary index, `(600, foo)`. This tells us that the list `foo` needs cleaning up. We clean up everything in `foo` less than 800. Since we store lists as a single key, we issue a RocksDB `clear` operation, iterate through all of the existing values, eliminate `(v1, 600)` and `(v2, 700)`, and write back `(v3, 900)`.\r\n2. But we still have things left in our secondary index! We now get `(700, foo)`, and we unknowingly do cleanup on `foo` _again_. This consists of clearing `foo`, iterating through its elements, and writing back `(v3, 900)`. But since cleanup already happened, this step is _entirely_ redundant.\r\n3. We encounter `(900, foo)` from the secondary index, and since 900 > 800, we can bail out of cleanup.\r\n\r\nStep 2 here is extremely wasteful. If we have `n` elements in our secondary index for the same key, then, in the worst case, we will do the extra cleanup `n-1` times; and each time is a _linear_ time operation! Thus, for a list that has `n` elements, `d` of which need to be cleaned up, the worst-case time complexity is in `O(d*(n-d))`, instead of `O(n)`. And it's _completely_ unnecessary work. \r\n\r\n#### How does this PR fix the issue?\r\n\r\nIt's pretty simple to fix this for value state and map state. This is because every key in value or map state maps to exactly one element in the secondary index. We can maintain a one-to-one correspondence. Any time we modify value/map state, we make sure that we delete the previous entry in the secondary index. This logic is implemented by OneToOneTTLState.\r\n\r\nThe trickier aspect is handling this for ListState, where the secondary index goes from grouping key to the map that needs to be cleaned up. There's a one to many mapping here; one grouping key maps to multiple records, all of which could expire at a different time. The trick to making sure that secondary indexes don't explode is by making your secondary index store only the minimum expiration timestamp in a list. The rough intuition is that you don't need to store anything larger than that, since when you clean up due to the minimum expiration timestamp, you'll go through the list anyway, and you can find the next minimum timestamp; you can then put _that_ into your secondary index. This logic is implemented by OneToManyTTLState.\r\n\r\n### How should reviewers review this PR?\r\n\r\n- Start by reading this long description. If you have questions, please ping me in the comments. I would be more than happy to explain.\r\n- Then, understand the class doc comments for `OneToOneTTLState` and `OneToManyTTLState` in `TTLState.scala`.\r\n- Then, I'd recommend going through the unit tests, and making sure that the _behavior_ makes sense to you. If it doesn't, please leave a question.\r\n- Finally, you can look at the actual stateful variable implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, but it is a format difference in the way TWS represents its internal state. However, since TWS is currently `private[sql]` and not publicly available, this is not an issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing UTs have been modified to conform with this new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`spark-submit` has one experimental option, which is `--remote`. This PR aims to make `--remote` option be an official option by removing `experimental` warning from Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0aee601dcc9875928fc526c821985d2890bdc42f/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmitArguments.scala#L568-L572\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`--remote` has been used well so far and intuitively. It's unlikely for us to change it. We had better remove a warning message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo behavior change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE (4.0.0-preview2)**\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-submit 2>&1 | grep xperimental | wc -l\r\n       1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-submit 2>&1 | grep xperimental | wc -l\r\n       0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-14T18:31:52Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T15:15:36Z","closed_at":"2024-11-15T15:15:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1ae9791a4879f831c2a4b94983427b3780f15ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c109a5374b6999c973751c5b5f688a1931ff44b","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50320","ref":"SPARK-50320","sha":"2c109a5374b6999c973751c5b5f688a1931ff44b","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current relative order of rules is:\r\n\r\n1. ResolveRelations\r\n2. ResolveIdentifierClause\r\n3. BindParameters\r\n\r\nThese rules interact in exactly the opposite way as they are listed:\r\n\r\n* BindParameters always operates on leafs\r\n* ResolveIdentifierClause turns constant expressions (typically parameters) into UnresolvedRelations\r\n* ResolveRelations is needed to progress resolved identifier clauses\r\n \r\nWe propose to move BindParameters and ResolveIdentifierClause up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis has two effects:\r\n1. The rule batch will converge faster, saving premature passes over the tree.\r\n2. \"Sloppily\" written rule extensions which come last have a lesser chance of not seeing UnresolvedRelation  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests suffice\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-14T17:21:56Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T14:55:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac0a169b93c2fa9862783828d3a8a3859511daf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4261498c6237373cb95096873087dbe06e810885","head":{"label":"srielau:SPARK-50319-Reorder-ResolveIdentifiertClause","ref":"SPARK-50319-Reorder-ResolveIdentifiertClause","sha":"4261498c6237373cb95096873087dbe06e810885","user":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":399207476,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTkyMDc0NzY=","name":"spark","full_name":"srielau/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srielau/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes not using session-level collation in DDL commands (create/alter view/table, add/replace columns).\r\n\r\nAlso, resolution of default collation should happen in the analyzer and not in the parser. However, due to how we are checking for default string type (using reference equals with `StringType` object) we cannot just replace this object with `StringType(\"UTF8_BINARY\")` because they compare as equal so the tree node framework will just return the old plan. Because of this we have to perform this resolution twice, once by changing the `StringType` object into a `TemporaryStringType` and then back to `StringType(\"UTF8_BINARY\")` which is not considered a default string type anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe default collation for DDL commands should be tied to the object being created or altered (e.g., table, view, schema) rather than the session-level setting. Since object-level collations are not yet supported, we will assume the UTF8_BINARY collation by default for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR targets at Spark Connect only. Spark Classic has been handled in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48677.\r\n\r\n`verifySchema` parameter of createDataFrame on Spark Classic decides whether to verify data types of every row against schema.\r\n\r\nNow it's not supported on Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to support `verifySchema` on Spark Connect. \r\n\r\nBy default, `verifySchema` parameter is `pyspark._NoValue`, if not provided, createDataFrame with\r\n- `pyarrow.Table`,  **verifySchema = False**\r\n- `pandas.DataFrame` with Arrow optimization,  **verifySchema = spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely**\r\n-  regular Python instances, **verifySchema = True**\r\n\r\nThe schema enforcement of numpy ndarray input is unexpected and will be resolved as a follow-up, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-50323.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nParity with Spark Classic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `verifySchema`  parameter of createDataFrame is supported in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI propose reverting the PR for changing pattern matching of `StringType` in the jdbc code stack, since it may lead to collated column being mapped to uncollated column in some dialects. For the time being, this is not the correct behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed in order to preserve proper behavior in the dialects regarding datatype mapping.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo testing was needed.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests with a test catalog for the affected commands\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-12T21:54:17Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T22:49:09Z","closed_at":"2024-11-27T22:49:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"949b4f5a7d78d030fb2d914527b3d043cb477bde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/41a6fafc035f4cca321c076e45064e20b05181a6","head":{"label":"olaky:spark-50285-metrics-for-staged-table-commits","ref":"spark-50285-metrics-for-staged-table-commits","sha":"41a6fafc035f4cca321c076e45064e20b05181a6","user":{"login":"olaky","id":1825975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky","html_url":"https://github.com/olaky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":495464826,"node_id":"R_kgDOHYgxeg","name":"spark","full_name":"olaky/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"olaky","id":1825975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky","html_url":"https://github.com/olaky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olaky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/olaky/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new `spark.sql.dataFrameQueryContext.enabled` flag to disable the `DataFrameQueryContext` creation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSPARK-49098 introduced a SQL syntax to allow users to set table options on DSv2 write cases, but unfortunately, the options set by SQL are not propagated correctly to the underlying DSv2 `WriteBuilder`\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO $t1 WITH (`write.split-size` = 10) SELECT ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.writeTo(t1).option(\"write.split-size\", \"10\").append()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the user's perspective, the above two are equivalent, but internal implementations differ slightly. Both of them are going to construct an\r\n\r\n```\r\nAppendData(r: DataSourceV2Relation, ..., writeOptions, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the SQL `options` are carried by `r.options`, and the `DataFrame` API `options` are carried by `writeOptions`. Currently, only the latter is propagated to the `WriteBuilder`, and the former is silently dropped. This PR fixes the above issue by merging those two `options`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `options` propagation is inconsistent in `DataFrame`, `DataFrameV2`, and SQL:\r\n- DataFrame API, the same `options` are carried by both `writeOptions` and `DataSourceV2Relation`\r\n- DataFrameV2 API cases, options are only carried by `write options`\r\n- SQL, `options` are only carried by `DataSourceV2Relation`\r\n\r\nBTW, `SessionConfigSupport` only takes effect on `DataFrame` and `DataFrameV2` API, it is not considered in the `SQL` read/write path entirely in the current codebase.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCorrectly propagate SQL options to `WriteBuilder`, to complete the feature added in SPARK-49098, so that DSv2 implementations like Iceberg can benefit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, it's an unreleased feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUTs added by SPARK-36680 and SPARK-49098 are updated also to check SQL `options` are correctly propagated to the physical plan\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMerge `options` of table and relation when creating WriteBuilder in FileTable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar to SPARK-49519 which fixes the read path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFileTable's options are accounted on the V2 write path now, but given the built-in file formats use V1 by default, it has no real effect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48664 to simplify the code. The new workflow is:\r\n1. The `col.outer()` simplify wraps the expression with `LazyExpression`\r\n2. `QueryExecution` does lazy analysis if its main query contains `LazyExpression`. Eager analysis is still performed if only subquery expressions contain `LazyExpression`.\r\n3. The analyzer simply strips away `LazyExpression` at the beginning.\r\n\r\nAfter this simplification, we no longer need the special logic to strip `LazyOuterReference` in the DataFrame side. We no longer need the extra flag in the subquery expressions. It also makes the API easy to understand: `col.outer()` is just used to trigger lazy analysis for Spark Classic\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes the shared SQL (JVM) interface the primary interface for Scala/JVM based Dataframe programming.\r\n\r\nThe implementations are moved to the `classic` and `connect` sub packages.\r\n\r\nThe connect client had to be moved to the sql/connect/common package because serialization requires the captured client classes to be on the classpath when deserialized on the server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is the final step in creating a unified Scala interface for both Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-11T14:19:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T04:18:38Z","closed_at":"2025-01-24T18:37:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7af7b4e8e9909718986b903da762cbc2d5ae6341","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr includes the following changes:\r\n1. Refactor the `dev/connect-gen-protos.sh` script to support the generation of `.py` files from `.proto` files for both the `connect` and `streaming` modules simultaneously. Rename the script to `dev/gen-protos.sh`. Additionally, to maintain compatibility with previous development practices, this pull request (PR) introduces `dev/connect-gen-protos.sh` and `dev/streaming-gen-protos.sh` as wrappers around `dev/gen-protos.sh`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, you can use:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/gen-protos.sh connect\r\ndev/gen-protos.sh streaming\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/connect-gen-protos.sh\r\ndev/streaming-gen-protos.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nto regenerate the corresponding `.py` files for the respective modules.\r\n\r\n2. Refactor the `dev/connect-check-protos.py` script to check the generated results for both the `connect` and `streaming` modules simultaneously, and rename it to `dev/check-protos.py`. Additionally, update the invocation of the check script in `build_and_test.yml`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvid tools for re-generate and checking `StateMessage_pb2.py` and `StateMessage_pb2.pyi`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-11T05:43:26Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T02:28:56Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T17:22:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e87c7092764241bb40e07f92f5f4dd0b79bc5a6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`DirectByteBufferOutputStream#close()` calls `StorageUtils.dispose()` to free its direct byte buffer. This puts the object into an unspecified and dangerous state after being closed, and can cause unpredictable JVM crashes if it the object is used after close.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes this safer by modifying `close()` to place the object into a known-closed state, and modifying all methods to assert not closed.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the performance impact from the extra checks, this PR also changes `DirectByteBufferOutputStream#buffer` from `private` to `private[this]`, which should produce more efficient direct field accesses.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImproves debuggability for users of DirectByteBufferOutputStream such as PythonRunner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a test in DirectByteBufferOutputStreamSuite to verify that use after close throws IllegalStateException.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, UTF8_BINARY performance regression is addressed, that was first identified here https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48721. The regression is traced back to this PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48222 when it first occurred, however this isn't the actual source of performance degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48222 caused the regression because it changed the `collationNameToId` function and made it slightly slower by removing a short-circuit for fetching the UTF8_BINARY collation. However this function should be called fixed amount of times for each query and from the benchmark framework at most once - this was not the case and it was the largest contributor to performance regression.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the benchmarking framework to not call this function at each expression, but once per the test case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting testing surface, benchmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-08T14:23:51Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T17:33:01Z","closed_at":"2024-11-14T13:33:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"153e951b8a4071d28e774e76e573058bbca700ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/568095418fb56ff551da7aaa710a7d8d96d127da","head":{"label":"stevomitric:stevomitric/fix-utf8_binary-regression","ref":"stevomitric/fix-utf8_binary-regression","sha":"568095418fb56ff551da7aaa710a7d8d96d127da","user":{"login":"stevomitric","id":16582560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTgyNTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16582560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric","html_url":"https://github.com/stevomitric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768027483,"node_id":"R_kgDOLccrWw","name":"spark","full_name":"stevomitric/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevomitric","id":16582560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTgyNTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16582560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric","html_url":"https://github.com/stevomitric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevomitric/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n[SPARK-48413](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48413) has brought ability to change collation on table.\r\nSo I suggest to shrink the feature to only leaf string types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRight now there is found problem with altering collation when table has metadata. Altering will be failed because of a metadata mismatch between user's type (that doesn't have metadata) and existing schema.\r\nPeople will be able to change any collation still, but they need to use full column path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, but the changed feature wasn't released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew test and fix old ones.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExpose `configure_logging` as a public API that can be used\r\nto configure the log level for Pyspark connect component.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe currently offer the mechanism to configure the connect-specific logger\r\nbased on the environment variable `SPARK_CONNECT_LOG_LEVEL`.\r\n\r\nThe logger is configured once at the the time of \"module load\". In some cases,\r\nPython frameworks (eg. IPythonKernel) can modify the Python log level after the\r\nfact leading to unintended log output.\r\n\r\nThere is no good way to restore the logger to restore its previous functionality\r\nto honor the environment variable configured. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nProvide a new API `configure_logging` in the module\r\n`pyspark.sql.connect.logging`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal testing by calling `configure_logging` with different log levels.\r\n\r\nFurther tested with IPythonKernel instance which changes the log level\r\nand confirmed that calling this API during app startup fixes it back to the\r\ncorrect log level.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-08T13:21:43Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T23:48:35Z","closed_at":"2024-11-26T23:48:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97716e096e502ed727052f1c54f8cb7c4812ba5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6eba5ad051531df91611129a414893715833bc42","head":{"label":"nija-at:expose-log-method","ref":"expose-log-method","sha":"6eba5ad051531df91611129a414893715833bc42","user":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":590063058,"node_id":"R_kgDOIyul0g","name":"spark","full_name":"nija-at/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are introducing checks for unique label names.\r\nNew rules for label names:\r\n- Labels can't have the same name as some of the labels in scope surrounding them \r\n- Labels can have the same name as other labels in the same scope\r\n\r\n**Valid** code:\r\n```\r\nBEGIN\r\n  lbl: BEGIN\r\n    SELECT 1;\r\n  END;\r\n\r\n  lbl: BEGIN\r\n    SELECT 2;\r\n  END;\r\n\r\n  BEGIN\r\n    lbl: WHILE 1=1 DO\r\n      LEAVE lbl;\r\n    END WHILE;\r\n  END;\r\nEND\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Invalid** code:\r\n```\r\nBEGIN\r\n  lbl: BEGIN\r\n    lbl: BEGIN\r\n      SELECT 1;\r\n    END;\r\n  END;\r\nEND\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Design explanation:\r\n\r\nEven though there are _Listeners_ with `enterRule` and `exitRule` methods to check labels before and remove them from `seenLabels` after visiting node, we favor this approach because minimal changes were needed and code is more compact to avoid dependency issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, generating label text would need to be done in 2 places and we wanted to avoid duplicated logic:\r\n- `enterRule`\r\n- `visitRule`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt will be needed in future when we release Local Scoped Variables for SQL Scripting so users can target variables from outer scopes if they are shadowed. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in 'SqlScriptingParserSuite.scala'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-07T16:36:10Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T01:59:14Z","closed_at":"2024-11-14T01:59:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be2d61b1f55c35acc38435325a20520b2e1f6085","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48795/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48795/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48795/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c27dcc754471cd68c8a14509a5f7bb291a9f1a06","head":{"label":"miland-db:milan-dankovic_data/unique_labels_scripting","ref":"milan-dankovic_data/unique_labels_scripting","sha":"c27dcc754471cd68c8a14509a5f7bb291a9f1a06","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, support for FOR statement in SQL scripting is introduced. Examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFOR row AS SELECT * FROM t DO\r\n   SELECT row.intCol;\r\n END FOR;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nFOR SELECT * FROM t DO\r\n   SELECT intCol;\r\n END FOR;\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementation notes:\r\nAs local variables for SQL scripting are currently a work in progress, session variables are used to simulate them.\r\nWhen FOR begins executing, session variables are declared for each column in the result set, and optionally for the for variable if it is present (\"row\" in the example above). \r\nOn each iteration, these variables are overwritten with the values from the row currently being iterated.\r\nThe variables are dropped upon loop completion.\r\n\r\nThis means that if a session variable which matches the name of a column in the result set already exists, the for statement will drop that variable after completion. If that variable would be referenced after the for statement, the script would fail as the variable would not exist. This limitation is already present in the current iteration of SQL scripting, and will be fixed once local variables are introduced. Also, with local variables the implementation of for statement will be much simpler.\r\n\r\nGrammar/parser changes:\r\n`forStatement` grammar rule\r\n`visitForStatement` rule visitor\r\n`ForStatement` logical operator\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFOR statement is an part of SQL scripting control flow logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests are introduced to all of the three scripting test suites: `SqlScriptingParserSuite`, `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite` and `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-07T15:32:34Z","updated_at":"2024-11-28T12:48:31Z","closed_at":"2024-11-28T12:47:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75c57035ce8fd6dc4977edfbac5e9b9e7db276c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3b3aebe883a5c113662301ba2d7d75032defde29","head":{"label":"dusantism-db:scripting-for-loop","ref":"scripting-for-loop","sha":"3b3aebe883a5c113662301ba2d7d75032defde29","user":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":834060712,"node_id":"R_kgDOMbbBqA","name":"spark","full_name":"dusantism-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new \"lightweight\" plan change validation, that will be run after every optimizer rule and enabled by default. Note that this is an extension to existing validation logic, which is currently enabled for tests but disabled by default in production. This new validation will be enabled by default but will be skipped if regular validation is ever enabled (since regular validation is a superset of this).\r\n\r\nRight now, the lightweight validation only consists of checking if the plan becomes unresolved (which is a cheap O(1) lookup).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf a query fails somewhere in optimization or physical planning due to an unresolved reference, it is likely due to a bug somewhere in optimization. Adding this validation helps us know where exactly in optimization that the plan became invalid.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this should only fail queries that would crash somewhere else during query compilation. It effectively brings the query failure closer to the cause.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAvoid unnecessary casting in `compute_hist`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nthe `__bucket` should be integer by its nature, it was double just because of the output type of `Bucketizer` in MLlib (almost all ML implementations returns double in transformation).\r\nAfter reimplementing it with Spark SQL, it no longer needs to be float.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn stream-stream join, only call getLatestCheckpointInfo() when the format version indicates that checkpoint version is supported.\r\nThe other place already have it applied: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/07301ddb889bdf361499f65e1708b5fdcab7e539/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/statefulOperators.scala#L350-L362\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese code is not needed and wasteful. Also inside it has assertion that we are not sure whether it is correct when the function is called when the state store is not created for the checkpointID feature supported.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMake sure existing CI passes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `getSystemProperty` to PySpark `SparkContext` like `setSystemProperty` at Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/4.0.0-preview2/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.SparkContext.setSystemProperty.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 0.9.0, `setSystemProperty` has been provided because Python doesn't have JVM's `SystemProperties` concept. This is usefully used like the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/99d27c9701019a0f534cc13c084895a00badee12/python/pyspark/shell.py#L84\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `getSystemProperty` additionally and symmetrically to provide an easier and better experience for both Spark developers and Spark App developers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a new API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added doctests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-06T21:06:08Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T04:30:03Z","closed_at":"2024-11-07T05:55:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfd5215654f1761a8fdb5413b314065c5ab43f8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a897a5538f92e88d7082c25c2562da35c8ca1cf1","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50251","ref":"SPARK-50251","sha":"a897a5538f92e88d7082c25c2562da35c8ca1cf1","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

It adds functionality to convert a Variant value to an InternalRow that matches the current shredding spec in https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/pull/461.\r\n\r\nOnce this merges, the next step will be to set up the Parquet writer to accept a shredding schema, and write these InternalRow values to Parquet instead of the raw Variant binary.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFirst step towards adding support for shredding, which can improve Variant performance (and will be important for functionality on the read side once other tools begin writing shredded Variant columns to Parquet).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, none of this code is currently called outside of the added tests.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-06T19:16:33Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T01:15:15Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T01:15:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa2128bd4ee3b60a79069f76e4adb6cf13f89d72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1dc23485f36afc8e6a6fc25d9170cb79d0187767","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-48898-write-shredding","ref":"SPARK-48898-write-shredding","sha":"1dc23485f36afc8e6a6fc25d9170cb79d0187767","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to trigger Python source lookup only once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor now, we trigger Python source lookup for every session creation. Python source lookup is expensive so it should happen only once statically.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, a bit of performance improvement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`MakeDTInterval` and `MakeYMInterval` do not catch Java exceptions in nullSafeEval like it does `MakeInterval`. So we making behavior similar.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo show to users readable nice error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, I changed error message type in error-conditions.json => it's a behavioral change for clients who parse error message type or error message text.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThere already were few tests to check behavior, I just changed expected error type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: '

needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48758#issuecomment-2458713378 via @cloud-fan \r\n> This is not the first time that we are restricted by the trait-based tagging system. Extending a trait is static as it happens at compile but we really want to be more dynamic at runtime. For example, we added Expression#stateful and removed the trait StatefulExpression a while ago. I think the same thing happens to NullIntelerant now. Shall we also add Expression#nullIntolerant?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified ExpressionInfoSuite,\r\n- Check whether SQL expressions should extend NullIntolerant\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-06T08:30:31Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T02:14:22Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T02:26:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e47e9b40993ead4a50bd09833f4cd736c1abc422","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/208cce38c7a29db5d4b8a2d7eff0381a20144614","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-50241","ref":"SPARK-50241","sha":"208cce38c7a29db5d4b8a2d7eff0381a20144614","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357976080,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc5NzYwODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"yaooqinn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch cleans up ColumnVector resource after processing all rows in ColumnarToRowExec. This patch only focus on codeben implementation of ColumnarToRowExec. For non-codegen, it should be relatively rare to use, and currently no good way has proposed, so leaving it to a follow up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we only assign null to ColumnarBatch object but it doesn't release the resources hold by the vectors in the batch. For OnHeapColumnVector, the Java arrays may be automatically collected by JVM, but for OffHeapColumnVector, the allocated off-heap memory will be leaked.\r\n\r\nFor custom ColumnVector implementations like Arrow-based, it also possibly causes issues on memory safety if the underlying buffers are reused across batches. Because when ColumnarToRowExec begins to fill values for next batch, the arrays in previous batch are still hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

This change should not result in a performance penalty as `allAttributes` is used only once during canonicalization in `doCanonicalize` (which only happens once since it itself is a `lazy val`).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context \r\nThe allAttributes method in QueryPlan ([code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/57f6824e78e2e615778827ddebce9d7fcaae1698/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/logical/basicLogicalOperators.scala#L2101)) unions the output of all of its children. Although this is okay in an optimized plan, in a pre-optimized analyzed plan, these attributes add up multiplicatively with the size of the plan. Because output is usually defined as a def, each node’s allAttributes also ends up with a distinct copy of each attribute, potentially causing significant memory pressure on the driver (especially under concurrency and with wide tables).\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example with TPC-DS Q42. SQL:\r\n```\r\n  select dt.d_year, item.i_category_id, item.i_category, sum(ss_ext_sales_price)\r\n from \tdate_dim dt, store_sales, item\r\n where dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk\r\n \tand store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk\r\n \tand item.i_manager_id = 1\r\n \tand dt.d_moy=11\r\n \tand dt.d_year=2000\r\n group by \tdt.d_year\r\n \t\t,item.i_category_id\r\n \t\t,item.i_category\r\n order by       sum(ss_ext_sales_price) desc,dt.d_year\r\n \t\t,item.i_category_id\r\n \t\t,item.i_category\r\n limit 100\r\n```\r\nIf we print out the size of each operator’s output and the size of its allAttributes:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimit: allAttrs: 4, output: 4\r\n  LocalLimit: allAttrs: 4, output: 4\r\n    Sort: allAttrs: 4, output: 4\r\n      Aggregate: allAttrs: 73, output: 4\r\n        Filter: allAttrs: 73, output: 73\r\n          Join: allAttrs: 73, output: 73\r\n            Join: allAttrs: 51, output: 51\r\n              SubqueryAlias: allAttrs: 28, output: 28\r\n                SubqueryAlias: allAttrs: 28, output: 28\r\n                  LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 28\r\n              SubqueryAlias: allAttrs: 23, output: 23\r\n                LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 23\r\n            SubqueryAlias: allAttrs: 22, output: 22\r\n              LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 22\r\n```\r\nNote how the joins and aggregate have 73 attributes each, by adding the width of each relation. For prod queries with wide schemas, this issue is much worse. Optimized plans after column pruning look far better:\r\n```\r\nAggregate: allAttrs: 0, output: 1\r\n  Project: allAttrs: 2, output: 0\r\n    Join: allAttrs: 2, output: 2\r\n      Project: allAttrs: 3, output: 1\r\n        Join: allAttrs: 3, output: 3\r\n          Project: allAttrs: 4, output: 2\r\n            Join: allAttrs: 4, output: 4\r\n              Project: allAttrs: 5, output: 3\r\n                Join: allAttrs: 5, output: 5\r\n                  Project: allAttrs: 23, output: 4\r\n                    Filter: allAttrs: 23, output: 23\r\n                      LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 23\r\n                  Project: allAttrs: 29, output: 1\r\n                    Filter: allAttrs: 29, output: 29\r\n                      LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 29\r\n              Project: allAttrs: 13, output: 1\r\n                Filter: allAttrs: 13, output: 13\r\n                  LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 13\r\n          Project: allAttrs: 22, output: 1\r\n            Filter: allAttrs: 22, output: 22\r\n              LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 22\r\n      Project: allAttrs: 18, output: 1\r\n        Filter: allAttrs: 18, output: 18\r\n          LogicalRelation: allAttrs: 0, output: 18\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI propose adding a new `SQLConf` entry which enables spark to read an invalid collation name as `UTF8_BINARY`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed in case when spark needs to read a delta table which has metadata with other convention for naming collations. Instead of failing, when this conf is enabled, spark would return the `UTF8_BINARY` collation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested by adding tests in `DataTypeSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move the `RewriteCollationJoin` rule added by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46599 to `FinishAnalysis`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe conversions of join keys that the rule does **should not be** considered as an optimization, but it is needed for correctness. So, we shall not run it as an optimization rule, it should be applied before any. Currently, optimization rules can produce plans (for instance, sub-queries) that become semantically incorrect after `RewriteCollationJoin`.\r\n\r\nWe could modify `RewriteCollationJoin` and take into account DPP and maybe other optimizations, but might miss something else. Fxing **all** results of optimizations in `RewriteCollationJoin` introduces some unnecessary dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing GAs. It is improssible to test wrong results of DPP because non-binary collated strings as partitions have not been supported by any built-in datasources yet.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
