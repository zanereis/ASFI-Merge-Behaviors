all symbols. This creates large module files as the export\r\nsymbol table contains too many entries. The correct approach is\r\nto export nothing by default. Anything that needs to be exported\r\nmust be explicitly specified. This is done by the following steps:\r\n\r\n    In the Makefile, add \"-fvisibility=hidden\" flag. You can search\r\n    for \"-fPIC\" to find the appropriate place to add the flag. This\r\n    hides symbols by default if not explicitly specified otherwise.\r\n\r\n    To declare of any symbol to be exported, add this attribute:\r\n      __attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))\r\n    The attribute string can be added using a macro definition. It\r\n    should be added right before the return type for functions, or\r\n    right after the 'class' or 'struct' keyword for class/struct.\r\n\r\nFor more info on shared module export symbol visibility read:\r\n    https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

#2431. In #2187, I was making a false assumption that the number of fields of a tuple nodes is the same as the number of parameters to a function containing the tuple. But this is not always the case, since the field value can be generated inside the function (or group). \r\n\r\nFor example, the [gluon SSD](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv/blob/master/gluoncv/model_zoo/ssd/ssd.py#L239-L242) model returns class ids, bounding box scores, and locations, shown below. After converting to Relay, the three outputs are put into a tuple. Three `slice_axis` and the last tuple are put into the same group. This group has one parameter, `result`, but the tuple has three fields. This caused out of bounds access in #2431. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  result = ...\r\n  ids = F.slice_axis(result, axis=2, begin=0, end=1)\r\n  scores = F.slice_axis(result, axis=2, begin=1, end=2)\r\n  bboxes = F.slice_axis(result, axis=2, begin=2, end=6)\r\n  return ids, scores, bboxes\r\n```   \r\n\r\n@tqchen @kevinthesun @jroesch please

PR adds the ability to generate informative error messages for Relay programs. This works irrespective of spans, and source programs. \r\n\r\nThe new error reporting works by collecting the set of errors generated by the program, then reporting them in two separate steps. \r\n\r\nThis design enables us to collect more than a single error when processing a program and report many at the same time. We can report errors on a module using the function `mod->ReportError(...)`.\r\n\r\nWhen can then choose to render the errors to the user as an error message using `mod->RenderErrors(...)`. This will use the reported errors to annotated the program using the text printer. \r\nThe error messages will be marked in red on the line they occurred.\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of the error reporting in action below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/696509/50931611-fcd2fd80-1417-11e9-8bec-9fc3e3aa2950.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently I have only enabled this behavior in the type inferencer, but the machinery is generic and exposed by `relay::Module` ideally future passes can take advantage of it. \r\n\r\nI plan to propose and implement a generic pass & pass manager interface soon. The pass manager should make it easy to opt-in to error reporting without much work from pass authors.\r\n\r\nI just got a basic version of this working and am still in the process of polishing the PR.\r\n\r\ncc @ZihengJiang @MarisaKirisame @joshpoll @weberlo @tqchen @zhiics @icemelon9

discussion https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2000\r\n\r\nSelect has the semantics of requiring both inputs to be computed, and previously we used it as if it is a conditional expression (if_then_else), while that usage is safe due to rewrite_unsafe_select pass, we want to rectify this. This PR makes the following change:\r\n\r\n- [x] remove select API for now from frontends, instead introduce if_then_else\r\n   - Make an explicit note in select API that if it not intended to be used to guard boundary condition\r\n   - Select can still be generated using constructor tvm.expr.Select\r\n- [x] Use if_then_else in the cases such as padding where boundary condition need to be guarded.\r\n- [x] Update InjectCopyIntrin to make it aware of if_then_else\r\n\r\ncc @dmlc/tvm-team @liwchang @cowanmeg

is the first PR of  https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2351 to support importing exist quantized int8 TFLite model. The base version of Tensorflow / TFLite is 1.12. \r\n\r\nThis PR support TFLite FP32 Relay frontend. The input layout is NCHW, which is not the same as TFLite's NHWC layout, because TVM's default supporting layout is NCHW and support NCHW very well like AutoTVM on ARM CPU. Don't worry, I have completed the translation layout work in the TFLite FE. Currently, it could run  [Mobilenet V1](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/mobilenet_v1_2018_08_02/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.tgz)  successfully.\r\n\r\nPrerequisite of Python packages:\r\n\r\n- flatbuffers\r\n- tflite\r\n\r\nYou could install flatbuffers using `pip3 install flatbuffers`\r\n\r\nFor the tflite package, as far as I know, we haven't pip package until now. You could choose two ways to install:\r\n\r\n1. git clone my generated tflite package: https://github.com/FrozenGene/tflite\r\n2. generate it by yourself. You could find the instructions how to do it in previous repo's README.\r\n\r\n@tqchen To run the TFLite frontend test, we should have `flatbuffers` and `tflite` packages in our CI machine. Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, I will write the tutorial of how to use TFLite frontend like previous frontends do.","created_at":"2019-01-03T12:14:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T13:42:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T14:59:07Z","merged_at":"2019-01-23T14:59:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"10df78a5ecd9bb43e8884e9e15929ec9e7202c31","assignee":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR adds passes in Relay to annotate expressions to indicate which device/context each operator should be executed at. #2296 is the proposed RFC. The following changes are made in this PR.\r\n\r\n- Extend target to accept a dictionary of device/context to target and add the fallback_device argument in `build` of `build_module.py`\r\n```build(func, target=None, target_host=None, params=None, fallback_device=None)```\r\n\r\n- Slightly Modify compile engine to stop lowering and generating schedules for device copy operators since the real data transferring will be only performed at runtime and no schedule is needed for this type of operators.\r\n\r\n- Modify memory plan to return both storage ids and device ids.\r\n\r\n- Add `on_device(expr, dev_id)` and `device_copy(expr, src_dev_id, dst_dev_id)` operators as synthetic op as @jroesch suggested. The former takes an `expr` and a `device_id` as inputs which indicate where an expression should be annotated. The latter will be used to perform data copy between different devices.\r\n\r\n- Write several passes to validate the annotated program, rewrite the program (e.g. insert device copy operators), and propagate the device information from device copy operators to the other expression, etc.\r\n\r\n- Add unit tests to test the functionality of different annotation schemes.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @jroesch

discussion about this PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2028\r\n\r\nTo leverage existing spatial pack schedule and add tunable compute_at knob to re-implement ARM CPU's depthwise convolution. Currently, this PR named this schedule as `contrib_spatial_pack` as discussed in the original PR https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2028.\r\n\r\nOn my A53@2.0GHz ARM CPU (MTK6763), which can boost 1.6X performance compared with previous depthwise convolution in the Mobilenet V1 model (I have also checked the correctness of this schedule). However, @yzhliu has also proved that this PR can also boost the performance on x86 CPU.\r\n\r\nThe following is the Tensorflow [Mobilenet V1](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/mobilenet_v1_2018_02_22/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.tgz) model auto tvm training GFLOPS log:\r\nCurrently:\r\n[Task 2/20] Current/Best: 0.98/ 2.32 GFLOPS | Progress: (1427/2000) | 2679.82 s Done.\r\n[Task 4/20] Current/Best: 0.56/ 1.15 GFLOPS | Progress: (1072/2000) | 2461.27 s Done.\r\n[Task 6/20] Current/Best: 1.08/ 2.78 GFLOPS | Progress: (1084/2000) | 1987.91 s Done.\r\n[Task 8/20] Current/Best: 0.39/ 1.19 GFLOPS | Progress: (1815/2000) | 2744.70 s Done.\r\n[Task 10/20] Current/Best: 1.09/ 2.33 GFLOPS | Progress: (1222/2000) | 1866.02 s Done.\r\n[Task 12/20] Current/Best: 0.42/ 0.90 GFLOPS | Progress: (1716/2000) | 2528.94 s Done.\r\n[Task 14/20] Current/Best: 1.89/ 2.63 GFLOPS | Progress: (1284/2000) | 2288.55 s Done.\r\n[Task 16/20] Current/Best: 0.47/ 0.96 GFLOPS | Progress: (1467/2000) | 2282.65 s Done.\r\n[Task 18/20] Current/Best: 1.43/ 2.61 GFLOPS | Progress: (1007/2000) | 1525.76 s Done.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR optimization:\r\n[Task 2/20] Current/Best: 0.00/ 4.83 GFLOPS | Progress: (1682/2000) | 1470.40 s Done.\r\n[Task 4/20] Current/Best: 1.35/ 3.17 GFLOPS | Progress: (1257/2000) | 1032.80 s Done.\r\n[Task 6/20] Current/Best: 2.04/ 5.49 GFLOPS | Progress: (1904/2000) | 1623.10 s Done.\r\n[Task 8/20] Current/Best: 0.75/ 3.15 GFLOPS | Progress: (1885/2000) | 1546.22 s Done.\r\n[Task 10/20] Current/Best: 2.09/ 6.07 GFLOPS | Progress: (2000/2000) | 1640.41 s Done.\r\n[Task 12/20] Current/Best: 2.99/ 3.80 GFLOPS | Progress: (1853/2000) | 1547.13 s Done.\r\n[Task 14/20] Current/Best: 4.59/ 6.06 GFLOPS | Progress: (1355/2000) | 1091.93 s Done.\r\n[Task 16/20] Current/Best: 1.96/ 4.01 GFLOPS | Progress: (2000/2000) | 1586.18 s Done.\r\n[Task 18/20] Current/Best: 2.33/ 4.63 GFLOPS | Progress: (2000/2000) | 1599.89 s Done.\r\n\r\nThe depthwise convolution total execution time on single A53@2.0GHz time can be from 45.3839ms to 28.1945ms.\r\n\r\nOne thing you must notice to use this schedule: You MUST make the XGBTunner constructor’s feature type argument be feature_type= 'knob'. i.e. XGBTuner(tsk, loss_type='rank', feature_type='knob'). Otherwise your program maybe hang forever. \r\n\r\nThis schedule is not default schedule (i.e. direct) of arm cpu / x86 cpu depthwise convolution. I will update the auto tuning of ARM CPU tutorial to show how to use this `contrib_spatial_pack` schedule in the following PR.\r\n\r\n@merrymercy @yzhliu @tqchen pls review it.","created_at":"2018-12-27T13:28:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T17:33:38Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T09:49:10Z","merged_at":"2019-01-11T09:49:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"394cf9f72a9c16f41055ded4c1cf8b3fa9420db3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nhynes","id":2353785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes","html_url":"https://github.com/nhynes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"phisiart","id":4835507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzU1MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4835507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart","html_url":"https://github.com/phisiart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phisiart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2345/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2345/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2345/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fab47290d64bc51142d0d99fd331076331b9584e","head":{"label":"FrozenGene:arm_cpu_depthwise_convolution","ref":"arm_cpu_depthwise_convolution","sha":"fab47290d64bc51142d0d99fd331076331b9584e","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","g

pull request adds the ability to generate descriptive errors for Relay. An error can be reported on a `tam::relay::Span` which corresponds to a source location in the original program.\r\n\r\nFor programs which are built programmatically we recover a representation of the program which is useful for error reporting. We generate this representation using the text printer and then parse it to recover the span information. \r\n\r\nOnce we have done this we can precisely mark an error on the original program, for example report the operator invocation which has a type error.\r\n\r\nMy goal is that we will only need to do this once when inputting the program, and store the program fragment in a `tvm::relay::Module`. \r\n\r\nThis PR lays the initial groundwork to do this kind of error reporting. \r\n\r\nI will do more experimentation and clean up work before this is ready to merge. \r\n\r\nOne large challenge is related to vars, due to vars appearing many times in the program, but only being allocated once we can not easily track the span information correctly for it using Relay's current representation. If we put the programs into ANF, we can provide very clear errors, but I think we will need to revisit how we track span information, but this will enable us to have informative errors in the mean time.\r\n\r\ncc @joshpoll @MarisaKirisame @tqchen @ZihengJiang

For (1, 16, 256, 256) input, it generates the following schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// attr [compute] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate compute[float32 * 1 * 256 * 256]\r\n// attr [compute] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate compute[float32 * 1 * 256 * 256]\r\nproduce compute {\r\n  // attr [iter_var(blockIdx.x, , blockIdx.x)] thread_extent = 1\r\n  for (i1, 0, 256) {\r\n    for (i2, 0, 256) {\r\n      compute[((i1*256) + i2)] = -340282346638528859811704183484516925440.000000f\r\n      for (k, 0, 16) {\r\n        compute[((i1*256) + i2)] = max(compute[((i1*256) + i2)], A[(((i1*256) + i2) + (k*65536))])\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nproduce compute {\r\n  // attr [iter_var(blockIdx.x, , blockIdx.x)] thread_extent = 1\r\n  // attr [compute.rf] storage_scope = \"local\"\r\n  allocate compute.rf[float32 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1]\r\n  // attr [reduce_temp0] storage_scope = \"local\"\r\n  allocate reduce_temp0[float32 * 1]\r\n  for (ax1, 0, 256) {\r\n    for (ax2, 0, 256) {\r\n      // attr [iter_var(threadIdx.x, Range(min=0, extent=64), threadIdx.x)] thread_extent = 64\r\n      produce compute.rf {\r\n        compute.rf[0] = 0.000000f\r\n        if ((threadIdx.x < 16)) {\r\n          compute.rf[0] = (compute.rf[0] + exp((A[(((ax1*256) + ax2) + (threadIdx.x*65536))] - compute[((ax1*256) + ax2)])))\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      // attr [comm_reducer(result=[(x + y)], lhs=[x], rhs=[y], identity_element=[0.000000f])] reduce_scope = reinterpret((uint64)0)\r\n      tvm_thread_allreduce((uint32)1, compute.rf[0], (uint1)1, reduce_temp0, threadIdx.x)\r\n      if ((threadIdx.x == 0)) {\r\n        compute[((ax1*256) + ax2)] = reduce_temp0[0]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nproduce compute {\r\n  // attr [iter_var(blockIdx.x, , blockIdx.x)] thread_extent = 1\r\n  // attr [iter_var(threadIdx.x, Range(min=0, extent=64), threadIdx.x)] thread_extent = 64\r\n  for (i2, 0, 256) {\r\n    for (i3, 0, 256) {\r\n      if (likely((threadIdx.x < 16))) {\r\n        compute[(((i2 + (threadIdx.x*256))*256) + i3)] = (exp((A[(((i2 + (threadIdx.x*256))*256) + i3)] - compute[((i2*256) + i3)]))/compute[((i2*256) + i3)])\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI updated the softmax schedule so that it works well for 4D and 5D inputs. Since the number of classes is \r\n typically small for these inputs, I simply use injective schedule (i.e., without using shared memory reduce).

I noticed a couple of problems while compiling an example with the tensorflow frontend module. The two small changes in the attached commit seem to fix the issues. One change is a simple rename of a dummy variable which was clashing with the function argument 'shape'. The second is to deal with the case of when a shrink axis operator produces a tensor with dimension zero - this does not seem to work with nnvm where the dimension must be at least one. I'd welcome any comments - particularly on whether this is the correct way to deal with the 0-dim result.

function `check_numerical_grads` turned out to be quite useful for testing automatic differentiation, so I suggest moving it from nnvm to tvm since it doesn't depend on nnvm in any way. Also added the ability to check gradients for functions taking positional arguments and added some tests. Since github can't show diff between moved blocks of code, you can see changes to the function itself
