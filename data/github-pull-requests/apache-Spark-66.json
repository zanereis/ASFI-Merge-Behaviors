What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr use enhanced  `switch` Expressions to replace the regular `switch` statement in Spark Java code refer to [JEP 361](https://openjdk.org/jeps/361)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndouble getPrice(String fruit) {\r\n  switch (fruit) {\r\n    case \"Apple\":\r\n      return 1.0;\r\n    case \"Orange\":\r\n      return 1.5;\r\n    case \"Mango\":\r\n      return 2.0;\r\n    default:\r\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException();\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n```  \r\n\r\nCan be changed to \r\n\r\n```java\r\ndouble getPrice(String fruit) {\r\n  return switch (fruit) {\r\n    case \"Apple\" -> 1.0;\r\n    case \"Orange\" -> 1.5;\r\n    case \"Mango\" -> 2.0;\r\n    default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException();\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pr does not include parts of the `hive-thriftserver` module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing `JEP 361: Switch Expressions` can bring the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. **More concise syntax**: `switch` can be used as an expression, not just a statement. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.\r\n\r\n2. **Safer**: In `switch` expressions, if we forget the `break`, there will be no unexpected `fall-through` behavior. At the same time, the compiler will check whether all possible cases are covered. If not all cases are covered, the compiler will report an error.\r\n\r\n3. **Easier to understand**: The new `switch` expression syntax is closer to our decision-making pattern in daily life, making the code easier to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr replaces `refQueue.poll()` with `refQueue.remove()` in the test case `reference to sub iterator should not be available after completion` to ensure that a `PhantomReference` object can be retrieved from `refQueue`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43325 replaces `Reference#isEnqueued` with `Reference#refersTo(null)` to eliminate the use of deprecated APIs.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some differences between `ref.isEnqueued` and `ref.refersTo(null)`.\r\n\r\n- The `ref.isEnqueued` method is used to check whether this `PhantomReference` object has been added to its reference queue by the garbage collector. When the garbage collector decides to recycle an object, if this object has one or more `PhantomReference`, then these `PhantomReference` will be added to their reference queues. So, if `ref.isEnqueued` returns `true`, it means that this `PhantomReference` has been added to the reference queue, which means that the object it references has been recycled by the garbage collector.\r\n\r\n- The `ref.refersTo(null)` method is used to check whether this `PhantomReference` object refers to the specified object. In the current code, `ref.refersTo(null)` is used to check whether `ref` still refers to `sub`. If `ref.refersTo(null)` returns `true`, it means that `ref` no longer refers to `sub`, which means that `sub` might have been recycled by the garbage collector. But this does not mean that this `ref` has been added to the reference queue.\r\n\r\nSo we can see the following test failure in GA:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6484510414/job/17608536854\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - reference to sub iterator should not be available after completion *** FAILED *** (287

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED` to our JVM flags so that we can access `jdk.internal.ref.Cleaner` in JDK 9+.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows Spark to allocate direct memory while ignoring the JVM's MaxDirectMemorySize limit. Spark uses JDK internal APIs to directly construct DirectByteBuffers while bypassing that limit, but there is a fallback path at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.5.0/common/unsafe/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/unsafe/Platform.java#L213 that is used if we cannot reflectively access the `Cleaner` API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test in `PlatformUtilSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe want to use the count bug handling in `DecorrelateInnerQuery` to detect potential count bugs in scalar subqueries.  it It is always safe to use `DecorrelateInnerQuery` to handle count bugs, but for efficiency reasons, like for the common case of COUNT on top of the scalar subquery, we would like to avoid an extra left outer join. This PR therefore introduces a simple check to detect such cases before `decorrelate()` - if true, then don't do count bug handling in `decorrelate()`, and vice-versa. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes correctness issues for correlated scalar subqueries pertaining to the COUNT bug. Examples can be found in the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, results will change. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded SQL end-to-end tests in `count.sql`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLower RocksDB background threads' CPU priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRocksDB background threads execute background tasks such as compactions and flushes. It should be in general lower priority than Spark tasks excution. For the case where a task may wait for some RocksDB background task to finish, such as checkpointing, or waiting async checkpointing to finish, the task slot is waiting so we are likely to have enough CPU for low pri CPU anyway.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun benchmarks and see the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a conf to set RocksDB State Store Instance's compression type, with default to be LZ4\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLZ4 is generally faster than Snappy. That's probably why we use LZ4 in changelogs and other places by default. However, we don't change RocksDB's default of Snappy compression style. The RocksDB Team recommend LZ4 and/or ZSTD (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Setup-Options-and-Basic-Tuning#compression) and the default is kept to Snappy only for backward compatibility reason. We should make it tunable with default LZ4\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests should fix it. Some benchmarks are run and we see positive improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-11T22:49:22Z","updated_at":"2023-10-24T20:25:53Z","closed_at":"2023-10-24T20:25:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f723c529003030636d9efd11f9fcc478647da5f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR captures the dataset APIs used by the user code and the call site in the user code and provides better error messages.\r\n\r\nE.g. consider the following Spark app `SimpleApp.scala`:\r\n```scala\r\n   1  import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n   2  import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n   3\r\n   4  object SimpleApp {\r\n   5    def main(args: Array[String]) {\r\n   6      val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Simple Application\").config(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", true).getOrCreate()\r\n   7      import spark.implicits._\r\n   8\r\n   9      val c = col(\"a\") / col(\"b\")\r\n  10\r\n  11      Seq((1, 0)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").select(c).show()\r\n  12\r\n  13      spark.stop()\r\n  14    }\r\n  15  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAfter this PR the error message contains the error context (which Spark Dataset API is called from where in the user code) in the following form:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== Dataset ==\r\n\"div\" was called from SimpleApp$.main(SimpleApp.scala:9)\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.divideByZeroError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:201)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval(arithmetic.scala:672\r\n...\r\n```\r\nwhich is similar to the already provided context in case of SQL queries:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 1) ==\r\na / b\r\n^^^^^\r\n\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use `java.lang.ref.Cleaner` instead of `finalize()` for `NioBufferedFileInputStream`.

recommended solution.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/dfacda488bfbe2e11e8d607a6d08527710286982/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/Object.java#L546-L568\r\n\r\n```\r\n     * @deprecated The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic.\r\n     * Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs.\r\n     * Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel\r\n     * finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified\r\n     * among calls to {@code finalize} methods of different objects.\r\n     * Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization.\r\n     * The {@code finalize} method might be called on a finalizable object\r\n     * only after an indefinite delay, if at all.\r\n     *\r\n     * Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method\r\n     * to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also\r\n     * implement {@link AutoCloseable} if appropriate.\r\n     * The {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference}\r\n     * provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object\r\n     *

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use pattern matching for type checking and conversion instead of the explicit type casting statement in Java code.\r\n\r\nThe change refer to [JEP 394](https://openjdk.org/jeps/394), and this pr does not include parts of the `hive-thriftserver` module.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  if (obj instanceof String) {\r\n    String str = (String) obj;\r\n    System.out.println(str);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nCan be replaced with\r\n```java\r\n  if (obj instanceof String str) {\r\n    System.out.println(str);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing `JEP 394: Pattern Matching for instanceof` can bring the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. **Code conciseness**: By eliminating explicit type conversion and redundant variable declarations, the code becomes more concise and easy to read.\r\n2. **Improved safety**: In the past, explicit type conversion was required, and if accidentally converted to the wrong type, a `ClassCastException` would be thrown at runtime. Now, as type checking and type conversion occur in the same step, such errors are no longer possible.\r\n3. **Better semantics**: Previously, instanceof and type casting were two independent steps, which could lead to unclear code intentions. Now, these two steps are merged into one, making the intentions of the code clearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-11T06:56:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T05:24:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-12T15:53:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5124a54afab9248c50c3e5eb7cef95e8c6cd018","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a13c9fe51c4b686279936035a02ce7ea14a4ae7","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:jep-394","ref":"jep-394","sha":"5a13c9fe51c4b686279936035a02ce7ea14a4ae7","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith [SPARK-45182](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45182), we added a fix for not letting laggard tasks of the older attempts of the indeterminate stage from marking the partition has completed in the map output tracker.\r\n\r\nWhen a task is completed, the DAG scheduler also notifies all the task sets of the stage about that partition being completed. Tasksets would not schedule such tasks if they are not already scheduled. This is not correct for the indeterminate stage, since we want to re-run all the tasks on a re-attempt\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince the partition is not completed by older attempts and the partition from the newer attempt also doesn't get scheduled, the stage will have to be rescheduled to complete that partition. Since the stage is indeterminate, all the partitions will be recomputed\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded check

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37268 which supports stage-level task resource profile for standalone cluster when dynamic allocation is disabled. This PR enables stage-level task resource profile for the Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsers who work on spark ML/DL cases running on Kubernetes would expect stage-level task resource profile feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe current tests of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37268 can also cover this PR since both Kubernetes and standalone cluster share the same TaskSchedulerImpl class which implements this feature. Apart from that, modifying the existing test to cover the Kubernetes cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Make add_artifact request idempotent i.e. subsequent requests will succeed if the same content is provided. This makes retrying more safe.\r\n2. Fix existing error handling mechanism:\r\n\r\nBefore the update the error looks like that\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.addArtifact(\"tmp.py\", pyfile=True)\r\n>>> spark.addArtifact(\"tmp.py\", pyfile=True) # fails\r\n2023-10-09 15:55:30,352 82873 DEBUG __iter__ Will retry call after 60014.279746934524 ms sleep (error: <_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:\r\n        status = StatusCode.UNKNOWN\r\n        details = \"\"\r\n        debug_error_string = \"UNKNOWN:Error received from peer  {grpc_message:\"\", grpc_status:2, created_time:\"2023-10-09T15:55:30.351541+02:00\"}\"\r\n>)\r\n(this is also getting retried)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it looks:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.addArtifact(\"abc.sh\", file=True)\r\n>>> spark.addArtifact(\"abc.sh\", file=True) # passes\r\n>>> # update file's content\r\n>>> spark.addArtifact(\"abc.sh\", file=True) # now fails\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n[...]\r\ngrpc._channel._InactiveRpcError: <_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:\r\n        status = StatusCode.ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n        details = \"Duplicate Artifact: files/abc.sh. Artifacts cannot be overwritten.\"\r\n        debug_error_string = \"UNKNOWN:Error received from peer  {grpc_message:\"Duplicate Artifact: files/abc.sh. Artifacts cannot be overwritten.\", grpc_status:6, created_time:\"2023-10-10T01:25:38.231317+02:00\"}\"\r\n>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMakes retrying more robust, adds user-friendly error (see above).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nMostly internal improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit testing, testing against server\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds an optional `ExecuteHolder` to `SparkConnectPlanner`.\r\nThis allows plugins to access the `ExecuteHolder` to for example create a `QueryPlanningTracker` without the need to create a new `CommandPlugin` interface like proposed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42984.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is currently no way to track queries executed by a CommandPlugin. For this, the plugin needs access to the `ExecuteHolder`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdjusted existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-10T12:42:18Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T16:44:08Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T16:44:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e056e667d708b7b005f5eae9467546bd119a85a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/549461f787c34236b8645d7a49b2919c2f7be6c5","head":{"label":"dillitz:plugin-new-approach","ref":"plugin-new-approach","sha":"549461f787c34236b8645d7a49b2919c2f7be6c5","user":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":661600404,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ284lA","name":"spark","full_name":"dillitz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supported all the parquet compression codecs, but the parquet supported compression codecs and spark supported are not completely one-on-one due to Spark introduce a fake compression codecs none.\r\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of magic strings copy from parquet compression codecs. This issue lead to developers need to manually maintain its consistency. It is easy to make mistakes and reduce development efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe `CompressionCodecName`, refer:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly sets `PYTHON_TO_TEST` to an empty string for other branches so they use their default Python versions.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43209 added a new option to the testing script but that option does not exist in other branches so it fails.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo recover the build (see https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_branch33.yml, https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_branch34.yml and https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_branch35.yml)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAfter merging this, I will monitor the build. I locally tested the changes too.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-10T08:35:28Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T11:55:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a96291819210dc4b75e05e74cbeaa15fe2d9fcf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7124854056d789d202833812c291784663e3ea24","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-45479","ref":"SPARK-45479","sha":"7124854056d789d202833812c291784663e3ea24","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are some places in `build_and_test.yml` where the Java version part is hardcoded to 8 when naming `test results/unit tests log`, this pr changes them to use `matrix.java/inputs.java`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe actual Java version should be used to name the `test results/unit tests log`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMonitor GA, check if the `test results/unit tests log` has used the actual Java version for naming.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `top-level` filtering in `MasterPage` JSON API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark's `MasterPage` JSON API always returns a full information, we need a post-processing like the following via `jq`.\r\n```\r\n$ curl -s -k http://localhost:8080/json/ | jq .completedapps\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": \"app-20231009193946-0000\",\r\n    \"starttime\": 1696905586694,\r\n    \"name\": \"Spark shell\",\r\n    \"cores\": 10,\r\n    \"user\": \"dongjoon\",\r\n    \"memoryperexecutor\": 1024,\r\n    \"memoryperslave\": 1024,\r\n    \"resourcesperexecutor\": [],\r\n    \"resourcesperslave\": [],\r\n    \"submitdate\": \"Mon Oct 09 19:39:46 PDT 2023\",\r\n    \"state\": \"FINISHED\",\r\n    \"duration\": 115686\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n\r\nApache Spark `MasterPage` provided a filtered result via REST API style for the top-level fields.\r\n```\r\n$ curl -s -k http://localhost:8080/json/completedapps\r\n{\r\n  \"completedapps\" : [ {\r\n    \"id\" : \"app-20231009193946-0000\",\r\n    \"starttime\" : 1696905586694,\r\n    \"name\" : \"Spark shell\",\r\n    \"cores\" : 10,\r\n    \"user\" : \"dongjoon\",\r\n    \"memoryperexecutor\" : 1024,\r\n    \"memoryperslave\" : 1024,\r\n    \"resourcesperexecutor\" : [ ],\r\n    \"resourcesperslave\" : [ ],\r\n    \"submitdate\" : \"Mon Oct 09 19:39:46 PDT 2023\",\r\n    \"state\" : \"FINISHED\",\r\n    \"duration\" : 115686\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with a new test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-10T03:05:55Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T06:45:48Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T06:45:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75136cd5a5ffff763663291f7ca60113aaa00abf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make HTTP redirects behavior in Web UI similar to other hyperlinks in the UI by using a path without host for Location header so that reverse proxies can be handled transparently in the same as other hyperlinks.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nLet's say proxy reverse URL is `https://example.org/sparkui/...` forwarding to `http://drv.svc/...` and `spark.ui.proxyRoot` is configured to be `/sparkui`.\r\n\r\n##### Existing behavior (without `spark.ui.proxyRedirectUri`)\r\njob/stage kill links, for example, redirect to `http://drv.svc/jobs/` that likely results in 404.\r\n(other hyperlinks point to paths with prefix, e.g., `/sparkui/executors` that works fine)\r\n\r\n##### After the change\r\nThe kill links redirect to `/sparkui/jobs/` that correctly opens jobs tab of the proxy host.\r\nThis behavior is also consistent with other hyperlinks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, proxies can be made transparent for hyperlinks in Spark web UIs with `spark.ui.proxyRoot` or `X-Forwarded-Context` header. However, HTTP redirects (such as job/stage kill) currently requires explicit `spark.ui.proxyRedirectUri` for handling proxy. This is not ideal as proxy hostname may not be known at the time of configuring Spark apps.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHTTP redirect paths will be without scheme and hosts. This is transparent to users as long as their HTTP client/browser conforms to [RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2) from 2014. When users set `spark.ui.proxyRedirectUri`, the existing behavior of redirecting with explicit proxy host and scheme is not affected by this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit-tests. Also confirmed that Spark UI redirects work fine behind an Envoy proxy with prefix without setting `spark.ui.proxyRedirectUri` in a k8s cluster.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

Unzipping this fails, as we unzip the file first, then do not create the directory, and fail to unzip the files after that.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix it by removing the `LICENSE` file, as suggested, by adding it to the exclusion list, so the folder gets copied. The contents are the same as `LICENSE.txt` (which is also just the apache2 license) so this should be fine. We also shade and copy over the new native libraries similar to the existing ones.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI\r\n\r\nI reran \r\n\r\n```\r\n./dev/make-distribution.sh --tgz  -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pyarn\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it succeeded\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Appendix: debugging\r\n\r\nI was able to debug the contents of the jar using `jar tf $jar` and print out the files using `unzip -q -c $jar $path`.\r\n\r\nTo make iterations go faster I went to `/Users/hasnain.lakhani/spark/common/network-yarn/target/antrun` and edited the ant file by hand then ran `ant -f

is the backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43191 for `branch-3.3`\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the HMS call fallback logic introduced in SPARK-35437.\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ntry {\r\n  ...\r\n  hive.getPartitionNames\r\n  ...\r\n  hive.getPartitionsByNames\r\n} catch {\r\n- case ex: InvocationTargetException if ex.getCause.isInstanceOf[MetaException] =>\r\n+ case ex: HiveException if ex.getCause.isInstanceOf[MetaException] =>\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDirectly method call won't throw `InvocationTargetException`, and check the code of `hive.getPartitionNames` and `hive.getPartitionsByNames`, both of them will wrap a `HiveException` if `MetaException`

is the backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43191 for `branch-3.4`\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the HMS call fallback logic introduced in SPARK-35437.\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ntry {\r\n  ...\r\n  hive.getPartitionNames\r\n  ...\r\n  hive.getPartitionsByNames\r\n} catch {\r\n- case ex: InvocationTargetException if ex.getCause.isInstanceOf[MetaException] =>\r\n+ case ex: HiveException if ex.getCause.isInstanceOf[MetaException] =>\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDirectly method call won't throw `InvocationTargetException`, and check the code of `hive.getPartitionNames` and `hive.getPartitionsByNames`, both of them will wrap a `HiveException` if `MetaException` throws.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it should be a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass GA and code review.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAccording to weather the map data shuffled by the lost executor are all reliable stored, `ShuffleDriverComponent` can support reliable store with specified executorId\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDownstream projects may have different shuffle strategy(which cause by cluster loads or columnar support) for different stages, for example Apache Uniffle with Gluten or Apache Celeborn. In this situation, some shuffle stages are local shuffle data, some shuffle stages are remote shuffle data which are reliable stored. once a executor is lost, we need use the executorId to decide weather the shuffle data produced by the executor is reliable stored.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nEnhances the `ShuffleDriverComponents` API, but defaults to current behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-08T14:39:08Z","updated_at":"2024-01-20T00:18:41Z","closed_at":"2024-01-20T00:18:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8163f5250d8908f9fb303b402cfa363efef00d6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91753e352c9f493ed03c78bc3f4ff4b9b5048ee5","head":{"label":"summaryzb:dynamic_support_reliable","ref":"dynamic_support_reliable","sha":"91753e352c9f493ed03c78bc3f4ff4b9b5048ee5","user":{"login":"summaryzb","id":37905939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTA1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37905939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb","html_url":"https://github.com/summaryzb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":309926041,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDk5MjYwNDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"summaryzb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"summaryzb","id":37905939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTA1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37905939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb","html_url":"https://github.com/summaryzb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/summaryzb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/summaryzb/spark","description":"Apache

the Application detail page, we had better show it consistently.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `StorageLevel` provides `fromString` to get the `StorageLevel`'s instance with its name. So developers or users have to copy the string literal of `StorageLevel`'s name to set or get instance of `StorageLevel`. This issue lead to developers need to manually maintain its consistency. It is easy to make mistakes and reduce development efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis PR could also fix the issue, refer: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43259/files#r1349488662\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet developers easy to use `StorageLevel`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nIntroduce a new class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to remove the last 2 extra spaces in the automatically generated `sql-error-conditions.md` file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- When I am work on another PR, I use the following command:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \\\r\n        \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite -- -t \\\"Error classes match with document\\\"\"\r\n```\r\n  I found that in the automatically generated `sql-error-conditions.md` file, there are 2 extra spaces added at the end,\r\nObviously, this is not what we expected, otherwise we would need to manually remove it, which is not in line with automation.\r\n\r\n- The git tells us this difference, as follows:\r\n<img width=\"725\" alt=\"image\"

patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-08T08:02:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-09T09:32:24Z","closed_at":"2023-10-09T09:32:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5d670f91d6b6b61b6ca8d9f8f47ec47e34d5b66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9031f458c63cf1b206e987997b21b278d3b14871","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-45459","ref":"SPARK-45459","sha":"9031f458c63cf1b206e987997b21b278d3b14871","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

with document\\\"\"\r\n```\r\nI found that in the automatically generated `sql-error-conditions.md` file, there are 2 extra spaces added at the end,\r\nObviously, this is not what we expected, otherwise we would need to manually remove it, which is not in line with automation.\r\nThe git clearly tells us this difference, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

The change point is that the execution process changes from ExecutedCommandEnec to CommandResultExec, but ExecutedCommandExec originally implemented the following method\r\n\r\noverride def executeToIterator(): Iterator[InternalRow] = sideEffectResult.iterator\r\n\r\nCommandResultExec is not rewritten, so when the hasNext method is executed, a job process is created, resulting in increased time-consuming\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nsc.setLocalProperty() has special meaning/feature for `null` value as a parameter and when supplied then removes the property associated with the key parameter. It's only mentioned in the [Fair Scheduler section of the documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#fair-scheduler-pools) although it is not limited to scheduler pool config and has got more general use cases.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be nice to document that on the APIs as well for users' benefit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAPI documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLocal lint\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-07T19:50:19Z","updated_at":"2023-10-08T20:51:35Z","closed_at":"2023-10-08T20:51:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd8af5dc5a0c65ea0aa7105d0f8a14d31cc8b3a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43269/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43269/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43269/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/458a91e93c8846f75afd10be3f470fe4d14488b3","head":{"label":"khalidmammadov:doc_set_local_prop","ref":"doc_set_local_prop","sha":"458a91e93c8846f75afd10be3f470fe4d14488b3","user":{"login":"khalidmammadov","id":11574708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTc0NzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11574708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidmammadov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":451158537,"node_id":"R_kgDOGuQiCQ","name":"spark","full_name":"khalidmammadov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khalidmammadov","id":11574708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTc0NzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11574708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidmammadov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidmammadov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khalidmammadov/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `InMemoryFileIndex` to use `FileSystem.listFiles` API instead of many recursive FileSystem calls.\r\n\r\nTo do this, a new configuration is introduced with the default value, `s3a`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql.sources.useListFilesFileSystemList=s3a\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve the nested directory listing performance. Currently, it's designed to apply for a single root directory listing case on S3A file system. For example, the improvement on a 3-year-data table with `year/month/day/hour` hierarchy is **158x**.\r\n\r\n**3-YEAR PARTITIONED TABLE (2021 ~ 2023)**\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-sql\r\nspark-sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd an equals method to `JDBCOptions` that considers two instances equal if their `JDBCOptions.parameters` are the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have identified a cache invalidation issue when caching JDBC tables in Spark SQL. The cached table is unexpectedly invalidated when queried, leading to a re-read from the JDBC table instead of retrieving data from the cache.\r\nExample SQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCACHE TABLE cache_t SELECT * FROM mysql.test.test1;\r\nSELECT * FROM cache_t;\r\n```\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nThe expectation is that querying the cached table (cache_t) should retrieve the result from the cache without re-evaluating the execution plan.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior:\r\nHowever, the cache is invalidated, and the content is re-read from the JDBC table.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause:\r\nThe issue lies in the `CacheData` class, where the comparison involves `JDBCTable`. The `JDBCTable` is a case class:\r\n\r\n`case class JDBCTable(ident: Identifier, schema: StructType, jdbcOptions: JDBCOptions)`\r\nThe comparison of non-case class components, such as `jdbcOptions`, involves pointer comparison. This leads to unnecessary cache invalidation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd uts\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-07T03:49:22Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T06:40:44Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T06:40:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a59c932c62d6d47a257224591b3cebd73fae7a20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84a6bb5c19e5479b27225ee8f6165d514d713cef","head":{"label":"lyy-pineapple:spark-git-cache","ref":"spark-git-cache","sha":"84a6bb5c19e5479b27225ee8f6165d514d713cef","user":{"login":"lyy-pineapple","id":46274164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjc0MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46274164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple","html_url":"https://github.com/lyy-pineapple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506059736,"node_id":"R_kgDOHinb2A","name":"spark","full_name":"lyy-pineapple/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyy-pineapple","id":46274164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjc0MTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46274164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple","html_url":"https://github.com/lyy-pineapple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyy-pineapple/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyy-pineapple/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade `commons-io` to 1.24.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe new version bring some bug fixes, eg:\r\n- IO-799: ReaderInputStream.read() throws an exception instead of returning -1 when called again after returning -1.\r\n- MagicNumberFileFilter.accept(Path, BasicFileAttributes) doesn't set its byteOffset before reading.\r\n\r\nIt depends on `commons-lang3` version `3.13.0`, which is consistent with Spark.\r\n\r\nFull release notes: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/changes-report.html#a2.14.0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass
