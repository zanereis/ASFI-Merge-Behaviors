This bugged me before but I didn't propose to change because of backporting worry. Since we're going to 3.0.0, the backporting concern is likely small. The name `SQLUtils` sounds quite confusing to me.\r\n\r\nThis basically targets to match with Python side utils:\r\n\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.api.python.PythonSQLUtils`\r\n`org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonUtils`\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.api.r.SQLUtils`\r\n`org.apache.spark.api.r.RUtils`\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.api.r.RSQLUtils`\r\n`org.apache.spark.api.r.RUtils`\r\n\r\n\r\n##

Previously such input was converted to `null`. After the changes, the input is converted to a row with `null`s in the `PERMISSIVE` mode according the schema.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark writes Spark version number into Hive Table properties with `spark.sql.create.version`.\r\n```\r\nparameters:{\r\n

`org.apache.spark.sql.create.version` because we used `org.apache.` prefix in Parquet metadata already. It's different from Hive Table property key `spark.sql.create.version`, but it seems that we cannot change Hive Table property for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, ORC and Parquet file generated by Spark will have the following metadata.\r\n\r\n**ORC (`native` and `hive` implmentation)**\r\n```\r\n$ orc-tools meta /tmp/o\r\nFile Version: 0.12 with ...\r\n...\r\nUser Metadata:\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make the `outputPartitioning()` method abstract in `SparkPlan` and implement it in child nodes to return actual number

Currently the method returns 0 partitions by default which is wrong in most cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor shuffle map stages, we may have multiple attempts, while only the latest attempt is active. However, the scheduler still accepts successful tasks from previous attempts, to speed up the execution.\r\n\r\nEach stage attempt has a `StageInfo` instance, which contains `TaskMetrics`. `TaskMetrics` has a bunch of accumulators to track the metrics like CPU time, etc. However, a stage only keeps the `StageInfo` of the latest attempt, which means the `StageInfo` of previous attempts will be GCed, and their accumulators of `TaskMetrics` will be cleaned.\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem: When the scheduler accepts a successful task from a previous attempt, and tries to update accumulators, we may fail to get the accumulators from `AccumulatorContext`, as they are already cleaned. And we may hit error log like\r\n```\r\n18/10/21 15:30:24 INFO ContextCleaner: Cleaned accumulator 2868 (name: internal.metrics.executorDeserializeTime)\r\n18/10/21 15:30:24 ERROR DAGScheduler: Failed to update accumulators for task 7927\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: attempted to access non-existent accumulator 2868\r\nat org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler$$anonfun$updateAccumulators$1.apply(DAGScheduler.scala:1267)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a simple fix: When the scheduler receives successful tasks from previous attempts, don't update accumulators. Accumulators of previous stage attemps are not tracked anymore, so we don't need to update them.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded new benchmark which forcibly invokes Jackson parser to check overhead of its creation for short and wide JSON strings. Existing benchmarks do not allow to check that due to an optimisation introduced by #21909 for empty schema pushed down to JSON datasource. The `count()` action passes empty schema as required schema to the datasource, and Jackson parser is not created at all in that case.\r\n\r\nBesides of new benchmark I also refactored existing benchmarks:\r\n- Added `numIters` to control number of iteration in each benchmark\r\n- Renamed `JSON per-line parsing` -> `count a short column`, `JSON parsing of wide lines` -> `count a wide column`, and `Count a dataset with 10 columns` -> `Select a subset of 10 columns`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-01T12:30:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:32Z","closed_at":"2018-11-03T16:14:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b2c7e50e4e5a99ffd9258cae6649014ce51aef7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ecc7e03dac6148047608af3b0199348302fce74","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json-benchmark-follow-up","ref":"json-benchmark-follow-up","sha":"4ecc7e03dac6148047608af3b0199348302fce74","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to document `-I` option from Spark 2.4.x (previously `-i` option until Spark 2.3.x).\r\nAfter we upgraded Scala to 2.11.12, `-i` option (`:load`) was replaced to `-I`(SI-7898). Existing `-i` became `:paste` which does not respect Spark's implicit import (for instance `toDF`, symbol as column, etc.). Therefore, `-i` option does not correctly from Spark 2.4.x and it's not documented.\r\n\r\nI checked other Scala REPL options but looks not applicable or working from quick tests. This PR only targets to document `-I` for now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n**Mac:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell --help\r\nUsage: ./bin/spark-shell

the Apache Arrow bindings for Java only support `Date` with the metric set to `DateUnit.DAY`, see [ArrowUtils.scala#L72](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8c2edf46d0f89e5ec54968218d89f30a3f8190bc/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/arrow/ArrowUtils.scala#L72).\r\n\r\nHowever, the Spark Arrow bindings for `R` are adding support to map `POSIXct` to `Date` using `DateUnit.MILLISECOND`, see https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues/1733.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change existing functionality but rather, adds support for the `DateUnit.MILLISECOND` metric in `Date` to avoid hitting a `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unsupported data type: Date(MILLISECOND)` exception while loading an Arrow stream to Spark.\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested with https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues/1733, by building Spark from source and

change hooks up the k8s backed to the updated HadoopDelegationTokenManager,\r\nso that delegation tokens are also available in client mode, and keytab-based token\r\nrenewal is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe change re-works the k8s feature steps related to kerberos so\r\nthat the driver does all the credential management and provides all\r\nthe needed information to executors - so nothing needs to be added\r\nto executor pods. This also makes cluster mode behave a lot more\r\nsimilarly to client mode, since no driver-related config steps are run\r\nin the latter case.\r\n\r\nThe main two things that don't need to happen in executors anymore are:\r\n\r\n- adding the Hadoop config to the executor pods: this is not needed\r\n  since the Spark driver will serialize the Hadoop config and send\r\n  it to executors when running tasks.\r\n\r\n- mounting the kerberos config file in the executor pods: this is\r\n  not needed once you remove the above. The Hadoop conf sent by\r\n  the driver with the tasks is already resolved (i.e. has all the\r\n  kerberos names properly defined), so executors do not need access\r\n  to the kerberos realm information anymore.\r\n\r\nThe change also avoids creating delegation tokens unnecessarily.\r\nThis means that they'll only be created if a secret with tokens\r\nwas not provided, and if a keytab is not provided. In either of\r\nthose cases, the driver code will handle delegation tokens: in\r\ncluster mode by creating a secret and stashing them, in client\r\nmode by using existing mechanisms to send DTs to executors.\r\n\r\nOne last feature: the change also allows defining a keytab with\r\na \"local:\" URI. This is supported in client mode (although that's\r\nthe same as not saying \"local:\"), and in k8s cluster mode. This\r\nallows the keytab to be mounted onto the image from a pre-existing\r\nsecret, for example.\r\n\r\nFinally, the new code always sets SPARK_USER in the driver and\r\nexecutor pods. This is in line with how other resource managers\r\nbehave: the submitting user reflects which user will access\r\nHadoop services in the app. (With kerberos, that's overridden\r\nby the logged in user.)

which\r\ninvalidates all your compiled stuff when you go back to sbt, making\r\ndevelopment way slower than it should.\r\n\r\nThere's also a task to run the tests directly without refreshing\r\nthe docker images, which is helpful if you just made a change to\r\nthe submission code which should not affect the code in the images.\r\n\r\nThe sbt tasks currently are not very customizable; there's some\r\nvery minor things you can set in the sbt shell itself, but otherwise\r\nit's hardcoded to run on minikube.\r\n\r\nI also had to make some slight adjustments to the IT code itself,\r\nmostly to

to Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25894)\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKnowing the number of physical columns Spark will read from a columnar file format (such as Parquet) is extremely helpful (if not critical) in debugging poor query performance on a parquet table with a deeply nested schema. This PR adds a new metadata field for `FileSourceScanExec` which identifies the maximum number of columns Spark will read from that file source. (N.B. the actual number of columns read may be lower if the physical file Spark is reading is missing some of them. For example, this can occur in a large partitioned table with a wide schema with sparse data—some partitions may not have data for some columns.) This metadata is printed as part of a physical plan. For example, take a `contacts` table with the following schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- id: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- name: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- first: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- middle: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- last: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- address: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- employer: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- id: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- company: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- name: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- address: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith schema pruning, the following `explain` query\r\n\r\n```\r\nexplain select name.first, employer.company.address from contacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nprints\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [name#3726.first AS first#3742, employer#3728.company.address AS address#3743]\r\n+- *(1) FileScan parquet [name#3726,employer#3728,p#3729] Batched: false, ColumnCount: 2,\r\n        DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location:\r\n        InMemoryFileIndex[file:/blah/blah/spark/target/tmp/spark-686cac53-0...,\r\n        PartitionCount: 2, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema:\r\n        struct<name:struct<first:string>,employer:struct<company:struct<address:string>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote `ColumnCount: 2`. This tells us that schema pruning is working at planning time. Without schema pruning, that same query prints\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [name#3726.first AS first#3742, employer#3728.company.address AS address#3743]\r\n+- *(1) FileScan parquet [name#3726,employer#3728,p#3729] Batched: false, ColumnCount: 6,\r\n        DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location:\r\n        InMemoryFileIndex[file:/blah/blah/spark/target/tmp/spark-947d2af3-8...,\r\n        PartitionCount: 2, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema:\r\n        struct<name:struct<first:string,middle:string,last:string>,employer:struct<id:int,\r\n        company:struct<...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote `ColumnCount: 6`. This tells us either schema pruning is disabled or is not working as expected. If we've enabled schema pruning, this query plan gives us an obvious avenue for investigation of poor query performance.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new test was added to `ParquetSchemaPruningSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2018-10-31T12:59:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T00:07:18Z","closed_at":"2020-01-06T00:07:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6dc3c4c091a73f3a5a4844a0410b1fbe952b4fb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22905/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22905/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22905/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7124ffab65a9eb41cc218fc9b52ce60dd8b4873c","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-25894-file_source_scan_exec_column_count_metadata","ref":"spark-25894-file_source_scan_exec_column_count_metadata","sha":"7124ffab65a9eb41cc218fc9b52ce60dd8b4873c","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis enhancement allows for specifying the desired context to use for the initial K8S client auto-configuration.  This allows users to more easily access alternative K8S contexts without having to first\r\nexplicitly change their current context via kubectl.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExplicitly set my K8S context to a context pointing to a non-existent cluster, then launched Spark jobs with explicitly specified contexts via the new `spark.kubernetes.context` configuration property.\r\n\r\nExample Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> kubectl config current-context\r\nminikube\r\n> minikube status\r\nminikube: Stopped\r\ncluster: \r\nkubectl: \r\n> ./spark-submit --master

- is pointing to a non-running cluster e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> ./spark-submit --master k8s://https://localhost:6443 --deploy-mode cluster --name spark-pi --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --conf

ordinal and extract value expressions. ~~In this PR, we combine the two into one method to make sure, there is only one method that is tasked with resolving the attributes.~~\r\nUpdate the description

now there are 3 different classes dealing with building the driver\r\ncommand to run inside the pod, one for each \"binding\" supported by Spark.\r\nThis has two main shortcomings:\r\n\r\n- the code in the 3 classes is very similar; changing things in one place\r\n  would probably mean making a similar change in the others.\r\n\r\n- it gives the false impression that the step implementation is the only\r\n  place where binding-specific logic is needed. That is not true; there\r\n  was code in KubernetesConf that was binding-specific, and there's also\r\n  code in the executor-specific config step. So the 3 classes weren't really\r\n  working as a language-specific abstraction.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the current code was propagating command line parameters in\r\na different way depending on the binding. That doesn't seem necessary, and\r\nin fact using environment variables for command line parameters is in general\r\na really bad idea, since you can't handle special characters (e.g. spaces)\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nThis change merges the 3 different code paths for Java, Python and R into\r\na single step, and also merges the 3 code paths to start the Spark driver\r\nin the k8s entry point script. This increases the amount of shared code,\r\nand also moves more feature logic into the step itself, so it doesn't live\r\nin KubernetesConf.\r\n\r\nNote that not all logic related to setting up the driver lives in that\r\nstep. For example, the memory overhead calculation still lives separately,\r\nexcept it now happens in the driver config step instead of outside the\r\nstep hierarchy altogether.\r\n\r\nSome of the noise in the diff is because of changes to KubernetesConf, which\r\nwill be addressed in a separate change.\r\n\r\nTested with new and updated unit tests + integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix fastSquaredDistance to calculate dense-dense situation calculation performance problem and meanwhile enhance the calculation accuracy.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nFrom different point to test after add this patch, the dense-dense calculation situation performance is enhanced and will do influence other calculation situation like (sparse-sparse, sparse-dense)\r\n\r\n**For calculation logic test**\r\nThere is my test for sparse-sparse, dense-dense, sparse-dense case\r\n\r\nThere is test result:\r\nFirst we need define some branch path logic for sparse-sparse and sparse-dense case\r\nif meet precisionBound1, we define it as LOGIC1\r\nif not meet precisionBound1, and not meet precisionBound2, we define it as LOGIC2\r\nif not meet precisionBound1, but meet precisionBound2, we define it as LOGIC3\r\n(There is a trick, you can manually change the precision value to meet above situation)\r\n\r\nsparse- sparse case time cost situation (milliseconds)\r\nLOGIC1\r\nBefore add patch: 7786, 7970, 8086\r\nAfter add patch: 7729, 7653, 7903\r\nLOGIC2\r\nBefore add patch: 8412, 9029,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously in from_avro/to_avro, we override the method `simpleString` and `sql` for the string output.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Update `AppStatusListener` `cleanupStages` method to remove tasks for those stages in a single pass instead of 1 for each stage.\r\n* This fixes an issue where the cleanupStages method would get backed up, causing a backup in the executor in ElementTrackingStore, resulting in stages and jobs not getting cleaned up properly.\r\n\r\nTasks seem most susceptible to this as there are a lot of them, however a similar issue could arise in other locations the `KVStore` `view` method is used. A broader fix might involve updates to `KVStoreView` and `InMemoryView` as it appears this interface and implementation can lead to multiple and inefficient traversals of the stored data.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing existing tests in AppStatusListenerSuite\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis turns off hdfs erasure coding by default for event logs, regardless of filesystem defaults.  Because this requires apis only available in hadoop 3, this uses reflection.  EC isn't a very good choice for event logs, as hflush() is a no-op, and so updates to the file are not visible for a long time.  This can still be configured by setting \"spark.eventLog.allowErasureCoding=true\", which will use filesystem defaults.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ndeployed a cluster with the changes with HDFS EC on.  By default, event logs didn't use EC, but configuration still would allow EC.  Also tried writing to the local fs (which doesn't support EC at all) and things worked fine.","created_at":"2018-10-29T20:16:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T09:03:10Z","closed_at":"2018-10-31T17:59:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22e3506ba17a64cf6e814a711507de5d1a916f63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a54c7d0ad4f088f7b8adef6cfa6fa773fecd463","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-25855","ref":"SPARK-25855","sha":"0a54c7d0ad4f088f7b8adef6cfa6fa773fecd463","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(Link to Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25407)\r\n\r\nAs part of schema clipping in `ParquetReadSupport.scala`, we add fields in the Catalyst requested schema which are missing from the Parquet file schema to the Parquet clipped schema. However, nested schema pruning requires we ignore unrequested field data when reading from a Parquet file. Therefore we pass two schema to `ParquetRecordMaterializer`: the schema of the file data we want to read and the schema of the rows we want to return. The reader is responsible for reconciling the differences between the two.\r\n\r\nAside from checking whether schema pruning is enabled, there is an additional complication to constructing the Parquet requested schema. The manner in which Spark's two Parquet readers reconcile the differences between the Parquet requested schema and the Catalyst requested schema differ. Spark's vectorized reader does not (currently) support reading Parquet files with complex types in their schema. Further, it assumes that the Parquet requested schema includes all fields requested in the Catalyst requested schema. It includes logic in its read path to skip fields in the Parquet requested schema which are not present in the file.\r\n\r\nSpark's parquet-mr based reader supports reading Parquet files of any kind of complex schema, and it supports nested schema pruning as well. Unlike the vectorized reader, the parquet-mr reader requires that the Parquet requested schema include only those fields present in the underlying Parquet file's schema. Therefore, in the case where we use the parquet-mr reader we intersect the Parquet clipped schema with the Parquet file's schema to construct the Parquet requested schema that's set in the `ReadContext`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA previously ignored test case which exercises the failure scenario this PR addresses has been enabled.","created_at":"2018-10-29T19:16:59Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T13:28:43Z","closed_at":"2019-04-08T13:28:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"323d4db714bbd65c6a0a0b786ba47059d6b58be0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4dfd45923d606cc55adc395a008e75cf9b43c874","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-25407-parquet_column_pruning-fix_ignored_pruning_test","ref":"spark-25407-parquet_column_pruning-fix_ignored_pruning_test","sha":"4dfd45923d606cc55adc395a008e75cf9b43c874","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOnly memory usage without GC information could not help us to determinate the proper settings of memory. We need the GC metrics about frequency of major & minor GC. For example, two cases, their configured memory for executor are all 10GB and their usages are all near 10GB. So should we increase or decrease the configured memory for them? This metrics may be helpful. We can increase configured memory for the first one if it has very frequency major GC and decrease the second one if only some minor GC and none major GC.\r\nGC metrics are only useful in entire lifetime of executors instead of separated stages.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdding

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBoth Spark and Hive support views. However in some cases views created by Hive are not readable by Spark. For example, if column aliases are not specified in view definition queries, both Spark and Hive will generate alias names, but in different ways. In order for Spark to be able to read views created by Hive, users should explicitly specify column aliases in view definition queries.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's not uncommon that Hive and Spark are used together in enterprise data warehouse, this PR aims to explicitly describe this compatibility issue to help users troubleshoot this issue easily.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nDocs are manually generated and checked locally.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSKIP_API=1 jekyll

lack of access to tmpDir from $PWD to HDFS\r\n\r\nWriteAheadLogBackedBlockRDD usage of java.io.tmpdir will fail if $PWD resolves to a folder in HDFS and the Spark YARN Cluster job does not have the correct access to this folder in regards to the dummy folder. So this patch provides an option to set spark.streaming.receiver.blockStore.tmpdir to override java.io.tmpdir which sets $PWD from YARN Cluster mode.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change provides an option to override the java.io.tmpdir option so that when $PWD is resolved in YARN Cluster mode Spark does not attempt to use this folder and instead use the folder provided with the following option: spark.streaming.receiver.blockStore.tmpdir\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nPatch was manually tested on a Spark Streaming Job with Write Ahead logs in Cluster mode.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-28T04:32:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T21:06:30Z","closed_at":"2018-11-14T21:06:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4c9f4481659f517996625f4fb21743bdb0e95b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c539c949abc5b8019e7fe79aa23fb440311d788f","head":{"label":"gss2002:SPARK-25778","ref":"SPARK-25778","sha":"c539c949abc5b8019e7fe79aa23fb440311d788f","user":{"login":"gss2002","id":8833819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzM4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8833819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002","html_url":"https://github.com/gss2002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154984614,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQ5ODQ2MTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"gss2002/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gss2002","id":8833819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzM4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8833819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002","html_url":"https://github.com/gss2002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gss2002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gss2002/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new optimization rule that replaces `Literal(null, _)` with `FalseLiteral` in conditions in `Join` and `Filter`, predicates in `If`, conditions in `CaseWhen`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that some expressions evaluate to `false` if the underlying expression is `null` (as an example see `GeneratePredicate$create` or `doGenCode` and `eval` methods in `If` and `CaseWhen`). Therefore, we can replace `Literal(null, _)` with `FalseLiteral`, which can lead to more optimizations later on.\r\n\r\nLet’s consider a few examples.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(1, 100).select($\"id\".as(\"l\"), ($\"id\" > 50).as(\"b\"))\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"t\")\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"p\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 1**\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM t WHERE

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Implement (optional) use of KryoPool in KryoSerializer, an alternative to the existing implementation of caching a Kryo instance inside KryoSerializerInstance\r\n* Add config key & documentation of spark.kryo.pool in order to turn this on\r\n* Add benchmark KryoSerializerBenchmark to compare new and old implementation\r\n* Add results of benchmark\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests inside KryoSerializerSuite to test the pool implementation as well as added the pool option to the existing regression testing for SPARK-7766\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSince Spark 2.2, view definitions are stored in a different way from prior versions. This may cause Spark unable to read views created by prior versions. See [SPARK-25797](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25797) for more details.\r\n\r\nBasically, we have 2 options.\r\n1) Make Spark 2.2+ able to get older view definitions back. Since the expanded text is buggy and unusable, we have to use original text (this is possible with [SPARK-25459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25459)). However, because older Spark versions don't save the context for the database, we cannot always get correct view definitions without view default database.\r\n2) Recreate the views by `ALTER VIEW AS` or `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AS`.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add migration doc to help users troubleshoot this issue by above option 2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A. \r\n\r\nDocs are generated and checked locally\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd docs\r\nSKIP_API=1 jekyll serve

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSince Spark 2.2, view definitions are stored in a different way from prior versions. This may cause Spark unable to read views created by prior versions. See [SPARK-25797](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25797) for more details.\r\n\r\nBasically, we have 2 options.\r\n1) Make Spark 2.2+ able to get older view definitions back. Since the expanded text is buggy and unusable, we have to use original text (this is possible with [SPARK-25459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25459)). However, because older Spark versions don't save the context for the database, we cannot always get correct view definitions without view default database.\r\n2) Recreate the views by `ALTER VIEW AS` or `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AS`.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add migration doc to help users troubleshoot this issue by above option 2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A. \r\n\r\nDocs are generated and checked locally\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd docs\r\nSKIP_API=1 jekyll serve
