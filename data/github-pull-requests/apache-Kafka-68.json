\r\n\r\nWhen logManager startup and loadLogs, we expect to catch any `IOException` (ex: out of space error) and turn the log dir into offline. Later, we'll handle the offline logDir in `ReplicaManager` [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L1914), so that the `cleanShutdown` file won't be created when all logDirs are offline. The reason why the broker shutdown with cleanShutdown file after full disk is because during loadLogs and do log recovery, we'll write `leader-epoch-checkpoint` file [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogLoader.scala#L184). And if any IOException thrown, we'll wrap it as `KafkaStorageException` and rethrow [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/checkpoints/CheckpointFileWithFailureHandler.scala#L37-L42). And since we don't catch `KafkaStorageException`, so the exception is caught in the other place and go with clean shutdown path.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issue by catching the `KafkaStorageException` with `IOException` cause exceptions during loadLogs, and mark the logDir as offline to let the `ReplicaManager` handle the offline logDirs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

a client connects to a SSL listener using PLAINTEXT security protocol,\r\nafter the TCP connection is setup, the client considers the channel setup is\r\ncomplete. In reality the channel setup is not complete yet. The client then\r\nresets reconnect exponential backoff and issues API version request. Since\r\nthe broker expects SSL handshake, the API version request will cause the\r\nconnection to disconnect. Reconnect will happen without exponential backoff\r\nsince it has been reset.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is not to reset reconnect exponential backoff when sending\r\nAPI version request. In the good case where the channel setup is complete, reconnect\r\nexponential backoff will be reset when the node becomes ready, which is after getting\r\nthe API version response. The fix doesn't cover the case where clients do not\r\nsend API version request and go directly to ready state.","created_at":"2022-05-06T23:15:03Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T15:45:11Z","closed_at":"2022-05-10T10:36:43Z","merged_at":"2022-05-10T10:36:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"eeb1e702eb7a43d88f11458f739672e2b7aa4871","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/dad0f2caf26d5076eb65462b69189e60deae27dd","head":{"label":"chernyih:KAFKA-13879","ref":"KAFKA-13879","sha":"dad0f2caf26d5076eb65462b69189e60deae27dd","user":{"login":"chernyih","id":21251470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjUxNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21251470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih","html_url":"https://github.com/chernyih","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":489486493,"node_id":"R_kgDOHSz4nQ","name":"kafka","full_name":"chernyih/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chernyih","id":21251470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjUxNDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21251470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih","html_url":"https://github.com/chernyih","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chernyih/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chernyih/kafka","description":"Mirror

`isDone` to `hasComplete` with a more specific meaning.\r\n\r\nWe are actually looking at analysing the reasons for renaming  identifiers and we would like to get advice from more experienced people, so would appreciate your feedback from one of the following perspectives.\r\n 1. `(merge)`you accept this renaming opportunity and agree with the recommended name\r\n 2. `(agree and not recommend)`you accept the renaming but disagree with the recommended name, do you think the recommended name means the same thing or is the recommended name simply not suitable?\r\n3. `(not agree and useful)`Would our suggested renaming opportunity be useful for your other refactoring activities?\r\n4. `(not agree and not fix) `You do not think our suggested renaming opportunity is appropriate.

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12050:\r\n\r\n> This patch includes a new metadata.version which is planned to replace IBP in KRaft clusters as specified in KIP-778. The kafka-storage tool now allows a user to specify a specific metadata.version to bootstrap into the cluster, otherwise the latest version is used.\r\nUpon the first leader election of the KRaft quroum, this initial metadata.version is written into the metadata log. When writing snapshots, a FeatureLevelRecord for metadata.version will be written out ahead of other records so we can decode things at the correct version level.\r\nThis also includes additional validation in the controller when setting feature levels. It will now check that a given metadata.version is supportable by the quroum, not just the brokers.","created_at":"2022-05-04T20:36:02Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T04:21:55Z","closed_at":"2022-05-06T04:21:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"548ef0050413fe70ae203a365dd3a80103072f0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f0a9b8f09cc70b634ad0bad1f37e26f457ccabe2","head":{"label":"ahuang98:KAFKA-13830-introduce-metadata-version","ref":"KAFKA-13830-introduce-metadata-version","sha":"f0a9b8f09cc70b634ad0bad1f37e26f457ccabe2","user":{"login":"ahuang98","id":51169659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTY5NjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51169659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98","html_url":"https://github.com/ahuang98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":296456083,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTY0NTYwODM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ahuang98/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahuang98","id":51169659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTY5NjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51169659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98","html_url":"https://github.com/ahuang98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahuang98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahuang98/kafka","description":"Mirror

someone new to Kafka, it would have been welcoming to see a succinct high-level overview of what Kafka is as the first piece of documentation. As I clicked on the home page of Kafka website, I read about seemingly disconnected pieces of what Kafka could do but the project didn't succeed in taking on a tangible form or differentiating itself from similar scaling systems. This leaves it up to the user to either quit or continue to push into a third attempt of research - but now with more apprehension. I thought my additions (quoted from the Kafka website) would add some clarity and decrease the barrier for those who may want to quickly learn about the system.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

added the metadata wait time in total blocked time (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11805). But we added it in the critical path of `send` which is called per-record, whereas metadata refresh only happens rarely. This way the cost of `time.nanos` becomes unnecessarily significant as we call it twice per record.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the call to inside the `waitOnMetadata` callee and only when we do need to wait for a metadata refresh round-trip (i.e. we are indeed blocking).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

is the first step towards refactoring the `TransactionManager` so\r\nthat it's easier to understand and test. The high level idea is to push\r\ndown behavior to `TopicPartitionEntry` and `TopicPartitionBookkeeper`\r\nand to encapsulate the state so that the mutations can only be done via\r\nthe appropriate methods.\r\n\r\nInner classes have no mechanism to limit access from the outer class,\r\nwhich presents a challenge when mutability is widespread (like we do\r\nhere).\r\n\r\nAs a first step, we make `TopicPartitionBookkeeper` and\r\n`TopicPartitionEntry` top level and rename them and a couple\r\nof methods to make the intended usage clear and avoid\r\nredundancy.\r\n\r\nTo make the review easier, we don't change anything else\r\nexcept access changes required for the code to compile.\r\nThe next PR will contain the rest of the refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

detailed description of your change*\r\nIn traditional we only have one SocketServer and one KafkaRequestHandlerPool in a process. In KRaft cluster, especially in co-resident mode, there may be multiple SocketServer and KafkaRequestHandlerPool, so we should avoid using the same MetricName.\r\nI just added a prefix for the SocketServer and KafkaRequestHandlerPool in ControllerServer, to differentiate between the ones in BrokerServer.\r\n\r\nNote that I didn't change Acceptor and Processor, since their metric name tags contain a listenerName, which will always be different for ControllerServer and BrokerServer.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)*\r\n1. integration tests.\r\n2. Tested locally, now there are 2 KafkaRequestHandlerPool metrics in KRaft co-resident mode, compared to only one before.\r\n<img width=\"1096\" alt=\"image\"

patch refactors the `Partition.makeLeader` and `Partition.makeFollower` to be robust to all partition updates from the KRaft metadata log. Particularly, it ensures the following invariants:\r\n- A partition update is accepted if the partition epoch is equal or newer. The partition epoch is updated by the AlterPartition path as well so we accept an update from the metadata log with the same partition epoch in order to fully update the partition state.\r\n- The leader epoch state offset is only updated when the leader epoch is bumped.\r\n- The follower states are only updated when the leader epoch is bumped.\r\n- Fetchers are only restarted when the leader epoch is bumped. This was already the case but this patch adds unit tests to prove/maintain it.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the patch unifies the state change logs to be similar in both ZK and KRaft world.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR focuses on the metadata log path. We might consider relaxing the leader epoch based fencing mechanism used on the ZK path now that the Partition is more robust.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-22T13:59:42Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T18:47:17Z","closed_at":"2022-05-09T18:47:15Z","merged_at":"2022-05-09T18:47:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b485f92647faecc3594bdf4164999d52c859b1bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/333bdb3b0863c7a79d5eaccf0d49c3083bb12e7d","head":{"label":"dajac:KAFKA-13790-3","ref":"KAFKA-13790-3","sha":"333bdb3b0863c7a79d5eaccf0d49c3083bb12e7d","user":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40044750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA0NDc1MA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"dajac/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dajac/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch adds a new case class `FetchParams` which encapsulates the parameters of the fetch request.

detailed description of your change*\r\nThe bug can be reproduced following KAFKA-13788, when creating an invalid broker config, we wouldn't treat it as invalid and will treat it as sensitive, and if we want to create a valid broker config, we will fail since the deprecated `AdminClient.alterConfigs` requires we specify all sensitive configs.\r\n\r\n1. If we user `AdminClient.incrementalAlterConfigs`, this can be avoided.\r\n2. I find we lack integration tests for altering topic and broker configs, so I added a bunch of test cases.\r\n3. As a convenience, I added KRaft support for `ConfigCommandIntegrationTest`\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)*\r\nA integration test `testUpdateConfigNotAffectedByInvalidConfig`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

first bug is that we are calling reloadUpdatedFilesWithoutConfigChange when a topic\r\nconfiguration is changed, but not when a broker configuration is changed. This is backwards.\r\nThis function must be called only for BROKER configs, and never for TOPIC configs. (Also, this\r\nfunction is called only for specific broker configs, not for cluster configs.)\r\n\r\nThe second bug is that there were several configurations such as `max.connections` which are\r\nrelated to broker listeners, but which do not involve creating or removing new listeners. We should\r\nsupport these configurations in KRaft. Only adding or removing listeners is unsupported, not\r\nchanges to existing listeners. This PR fixes the configuration change validation to support this.\r\n(This also removes a very puzzling error mesage stating that we are adding or removing listeners,\r\nwhen we are not).","created_at":"2022-04-18T21:57:56Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T20:17:20Z","closed_at":"2022-04-19T20:17:16Z","merged_at":"2022-04-19T20:17:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c3f605fc78f297ecf5accdcdec18471c19cf7d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12063/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12063/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12063/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4c0d93741f79239f091d6a42c88be7589c3c03d7","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-13835","ref":"KAFKA-13835","sha":"4c0d93741f79239f091d6a42c88be7589c3c03d7","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch builds on #12072 and adds controller support for `metadata.version`. The kafka-storage tool now allows a user to specify a specific metadata.version to bootstrap into the cluster, otherwise the latest version is used.\r\n\r\nUpon the first leader election of the KRaft quroum, this initial metadata.version is written into the metadata log. When writing snapshots, a FeatureLevelRecord for metadata.version will be written out ahead of other records so we can decode things at the correct version level.\r\n\r\nThis also includes additional validation in the controller when setting feature levels. It will now check that a given metadata.version is supportable by the quroum, not just the brokers.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-14T19:38:31Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T19:09:04Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T19:08:37Z","merged_at":"2022-05-18T19:08:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"1135f22eaf404fdf76489302648199578876c4ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12050/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12050/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12050/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/061de6cb8c4018a5976a64f53be91f67fbd15feb","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-13830-introduce-metadata-version","ref":"KAFKA-13830-introduce-metadata-version","sha":"061de6cb8c4018a5976a64f53be91f67fbd15feb","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

design is described in detail in KIP-794\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-794%3A+Strictly+Uniform+Sticky+Partitioner.\r\n\r\nImplementation notes:\r\n\r\nThe default partitioning logic is moved to the BuiltInPartitioner class\r\n(there is one object per topic).  The object keeps track of how many\r\nbytes are produced per-partition and once the amount exceeds batch.size,\r\nswitches to the next partition (note that partition switch decision is\r\ndecoupled from batching).  The object also keeps track of probability\r\nweights that are based on the queue sizes (the larger the queue size\r\nis the less chance for the next partition to be chosen).  The queue\r\nsizes are calculated in the RecordAccumulator in the `ready` method,\r\nthe method already enumerates all partitions so we just add some extra\r\nlogic into the existing O(N) method.  The partition switch decision may\r\ntake O(logN), where N is the number partitions per topic, but it happens\r\nonly once per batch.size (and the logic is avoided when all queues are\r\nof equal size).  Produce bytes accounting logic is lock-free.\r\n\r\nWhen partitioner.availability.timeout.ms is non-0, RecordAccumulator\r\nkeeps stats on \"node latency\" which is defined as the difference between\r\nthe last time the node had a batch waiting to be send and the last time\r\nthe node was ready to take a new batch.  If this difference exceeds\r\npartitioner.availability.timeout.ms we don't switch to that partition\r\nuntil the node is ready.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding unit tests are added / modified.\r\n\r\nThe perf test results are in the KIP-794.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [

Why does the test fail?\r\n`ConnectionQuotasTest.testListenerConnectionRateLimitWhenActualRateAboveLimit()` sends 600 connection creation requests at a rate of 40/s with a listenerQuotaConnectionRateLimit set to 30/s. The test asserts that even though the rate of requests is higher than threshold, due to correct throttling, the measured rate at the completion of 600 requests is 30 +- epsilon. The value of epsilon is set to 7 which is exceeded from time to time leading to flaky test failures.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\nCurrently, calculate of rate function (used for rate limiting) holds the following assumptions:\r\n> 1. Start time of a new sample window is time at which first event in that window is recorded.\r\n> 2. If we don't have `quota.window.num` windows retained, assume that we have prior windows with zero records while calculating the rate.\r\n\r\nThese assumptions lead to wrong calculation of rate in certain scenario as described below. \r\n\r\nConsider a scenario when we have some initial requests, followed by a small gap without any requests and then another bunch of requests. More specifically:\r\n\r\nConfiguration = [quota.window.size.seconds](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_quota.window.size.seconds)= 1s [quota.window.num](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_quota.window.num) = 2  listenerName.[max.connection.creation.rate](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_max.connection.creation.rate) = 30/s`\r\n\r\nRecord events (E) at timestamps:\r\nE1 | CurrentTimeStamp (T1) | Window#1 (start time = T1)\r\nE2 | T2 = T1 + 30ms | Window#1\r\nE3 | T3 = T1 + 995ms | Window#1\r\n< No events from T3 to T4 > \r\nE4 | T4 = T1 + 1020ms | Window#2 (start time = T1 + 1020ms)\r\nE5 | T5 = T1 + 2010ms | Window#2\r\n\r\nRate calculated as per current implementation:\r\nRate at T1 = 1 / (length of hypothetical prior samples + time elapsed for current sample) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1 events per second\r\nRate at T2 = 2 / (1 + 0.030) = 1.94 events per second\r\nRate at T3 = 3/ (1 + 0.995) = 1.5 events per second\r\nRate at T4 = 4/ (now - start time of oldest window) = 4 / 1.02 = 3.92 events per second\r\n\r\nWhen calculating rate for T5, first \"obsolete windows\" are purged, i.e. any window with start time < T5 - (quota.window.size.seconds * quota.window.num), thus, Window#1 is purged (because T1 < T5-2s)\r\n\r\nRate at T5 = 2/ (length of hypothetical prior samples + time elapsed for current sample) = 2 / 1.99 = 1.005 events per second\r\n\r\n**Note how the rate calculation for T5 has fallen back to using the assumption that there exists prior windows with zero events (due to purge) whereas we do actually have a previous window with > 0 events in it. Hence, rate calculated at T5 is incorrect.** In worst case scenarios Window#1 could have large number of events in it but calculation of rate towards end of Window#2 would ignore all those earlier events leading to an incorrect low value of current rate. For throttling use cases, this would lead to allowing more events (since current observed rate is low) and thus, violating the contract to maintain a sustained `max.connection.creation.rate`\r\n\r\nThe flaky test `ConnectionQuotasTest.testListenerConnectionRateLimitWhenActualRateAboveLimit` suffers from the problem described here from time to time leading to higher rate of connection creation than expected.\r\n\r\n## The solution\r\nThe solution is to remove assumption 1 stated earlier. Instead replace assumption 1 with:\r\n\r\n> Start time of a new sample window is the nearest time at which the window should have started assuming no gaps.\r\n\r\nThe nearest time is calculated as \r\n\r\n```\r\ncurrentWindowStartTimeMs = recordingTimeMs - ((recordingTimeMs - previousWindowEndtime) % config.timeWindowMs())\r\n\r\nwhere \r\nrecordingTimeMs is time of first record in a window\r\npreviousWindowEndtime is end time for previous window calculated as previousWindowStartTime + quota.window.size.seconds\r\nconfig.timeWindowMs is quota.window.size.seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the solution, T5 moves to 3rd window (window rollover occurs at T1 + 2000ms) and the rate at T5 becomes: \r\nRate at T5 = 2/ (now - start time of oldest window) = 2 / 1.010 = 1.98 events per second\r\n\r\nThis scenario has also been added as a unit test in `MetricsTest.java`\r\n\r\n## Code changes\r\n1. Changes in `SampledStat#record()` to make the change in assumption 1 as described above. The change is made when rollover into a window occurs.\r\n2. Add new tests in `MetricsTest.java` \r\n3. Cosmetic syntax changes across files.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- [x] New test added to validate the change in assumption.\r\n- [x] `./gradlew unitTest` passes.\r\n- [x] `./gradlew integrationTest` passes.\r\n\r\n## Longer term solutions\r\n1. Longer term I think we should move to a sliding window based approach to calculate rate instead of the fixed window approach applied today. \r\n2. The current rate limiting approach also allows short burst of traffic. There should be a configurable option for the users to choose between the approach which allows short bursts vs. an approach where system tried to maintain a smooth rate over time such that at no time does it go beyond the allocated threshold. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build
