Summary\r\n- As described in [KAFKA-17061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17061), [liveBrokerIds calculation](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3.3.2/core/src/main/scala/kafka/controller/ControllerContext.scala#L217) is very costly.\r\n    * This is the hot path in new broker registration handling in ZK-based controller, because this is called in a iteration over entire partitions in the cluster\r\n- To avoid calculating `liveOrShuttingDownBrokerEpochs.keySet.diff(shuttingDownBrokerIds)`, we fix `isReplicaOnline` to not rely on liveBrokerIds\r\n\r\n## Benchmark result\r\n\r\n```\r\n# before patch\r\nBenchmark

is a shim to allow the use of both modern (JRE 18+) and legacy APIs (deprecated in 17, degraded in 23, removal unknown) related to [JEP 411: Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal](https://openjdk.org/jeps/411).\r\n\r\nThis shim implements the interim strategy outlined in [KIP-1006: Remove SecurityManager Support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1006%3A+Remove+SecurityManager+Support) where legacy APIs are used as long as they are available and functional. Once the legacy APIs are removed or degraded, the modern APIs are used instead.\r\n\r\nThe shim is structured as a general interface with four 'strategy' implementations for testability. These implementations allow for mocking out the classloading infrastructure to simulate situations which no current JRE implements, namely removal and further degradation of functionality.\r\n\r\n###

a new startup mode, `STARTUP_MODE_HEALTH_CHECK`, and uses that as the new default value, for verifying worker readiness during system tests. This mode waits for a 200 response from the `GET /health` endpoint from the worker, and is resilient against temporary errors that may occur during startup (such as failure to start the REST server or initialize its resources yet).\r\n\r\nI have not been able to run the full gamut of Connect system tests locally, but I have verified that this works with the

There is no easy way to implement stickiness and co-partitioning and hence we have resorted to recomputing the target assignment every time.\r\n\r\nIn case of static membership, instanceIds are

the `PurgeRepartitionTopicintegrationTest` was written, the `InitialTaskDelayMs` was hard-coded on the broker requiring setting a timeout in the test to wait for the delay to expire.

pr is intended to add system tests `ConsumerProtocolMigrationTest` to test the protocol upgrade/downgrade.\r\n\r\nCurrently it has a `ConsumerProtocolMigrationTest.test_boucing_consumer` which stops and restarts consumers.\r\n\r\nWe are seeing the following error when running `test_boucing_consumer`.\r\n```\r\n- \"Consumed records should only be received when joined\"\r\n- \"Consumed position %d is behind the current committed offset %d for partition %s\"\r\n- \"Consumed records for partition %s which is not assigned\"\r\n- \"Consumers failed to join in a reasonable amount of time\"\r\n```\r\nThe first error is because `ConsumerEventHandler.handle_records_consumed` requires the verifiable consumer state to be `Joined` to fetch the record. The state is updated to `Rebalancing` if the consumer revokes partitions and updated to `Joined` if the consumer is assigned with partitions. If the fetch request falls between the partition revocation and partition assignment, the assertion fails. \r\n\r\nHowever for the new protocol consumer, it should still be able to consume records after revocation and before assignment. So a new `ConsumerProtocolConsumerEventHandler` is created to keep the consumer state after revocation and it fixes the issue. The 4th error is also fixed along with the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

applications use SSL/TLS to connect with Kafka brokers in order to implement secured communication. The clients initiate SSL communication with Kafka brokers using the SSL Engine constructed from the ssl.* properties pointing to key store and trust store. This PR addresses couple of important enhancements related to how the key store is loaded for secured communication with Kafka brokers.\r\n  \r\n**Problem 1:**\r\nMost of the times, the key store on the client side contains single key. But when the key store contains multiple keys, in order to avoid SSL handshake issues or authorization issues communicating with Kafka brokers, it is required to choose the right key from the key store.\r\n**Solution 1:**\r\nThe key can be identified via key alias while constructing the SSL engine. This requires client to provide a new property ssl.keystore.alias that points to the key alias within the key store. The key manager implementation is modified to return the named key to be used for building the SSL Engine.\r\n \r\n**Problem 2:**\r\nMost of the container platforms such as PCF where the client applications are deployed set key store and trust store are environment variables with Base64 encoded PEM. Kafka clients expect the key store and trust store to be file system artefacts. This introduces custom logic to read these environment variables and create a key store / trust store out of that.\r\n**Solution 2:**\r\nThis can be solved by implementing loading the key store directly from environment variables as input stream. Two new configs ssl.keystore.as.string and ssl.truststore.as.string are added to indicate loading the key stores from these environment variables. When the values are true, it indicates the ssl.keystore.location and ssl.trustore.location are pointing to environment variables instead of paths. \r\n\r\n**Example configuration:**\r\nssl.truststore.as.string=true\r\nssl.keystore.type=JKS\r\nssl.truststore.location=${KEYSTORE} // populate this as an environment variable\r\nssl.keystore.as.string=true\r\nssl.truststore.type=JKS\r\nssl.keystore.location= ${TRUSTSTORE} // populate this as an environment variable\r\n\r\n \r\nAll unit tests are passing and added a new test to verify that the base64 encoded string works with the code changes. No changes were made to any other unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-01T04:55:47Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T03:37:09Z","closed_at":"2025-02-05T03:37:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"985316dfee15312d25af188b144b739849518a66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

patch partially reverts `group.version` in trunk. I kept the `GroupVersion` class but removed it from `Features` so it is not advertised. I also kept all the changes in the test framework. I removed the logic to require `group.version=1` to enable the new consumer rebalance protocol. The new protocol is enabled based on the static configuration.\r\n\r\nFor the context, I prefer to revert it in trunk now so we don't forget to revert it in the 3.9 release. I will bring it back for the 4.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

Now there will be no production features, so we won't send any over the wire in ApiVersions or BrokerRegistration and cause issues when the receiver is on an old version.\r\n\r\nI reverted the typo PR to make the reverts cleaner and minimize chances for errors. The only conflicts were due to imports and a modified test testConsumerGroupDescribe. The fix was to keep the modified parameters but remove the metadataCache code.

to KIP-853, users were not allow to enumerate listeners specified in `controller.listener.names` in the `advertised.listeners`. This decision was made in 3.3 because the `controller.quorum.voters` property is in effect the list of advertised listeners for all of the controllers.\r\n\r\nKIP-853 is moving away from `controller.quorum.voters` in favor of a dynamic set of voters. This means that the user needs to have a way of specifying the advertised listeners for controller.\r\n\r\nThis change allows the users to specify listener names in `controller.listener.names` in `advertised.listeners`. To make this change forwards compatible (use a valid configuration from 3.8 in 3.9), the controller's advertised listeners are going to get computed by looking up the endpoint in `advertised.listeners`. If it doesn't exist, the controller will look up the endpoint in the `listeners` configuration.\r\n\r\nThis change also includes a fix the to the BeginQuorumEpoch request where the default value for VoterId was 0 instead of -1.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

About\r\nImplemented the functionality which takes care of archiving the records when LSO moves past them. Implemented the following functions - \r\n1. `updateCacheAndOffsets` - Updates the cached state, start and end offsets of the share partition as per the new log start offset. The method is called when the log start offset is moved for the share partition.\r\n2. `archiveAvailableRecordsOnLsoMovement` - This function archives all the available records when they are behind the LSO.\r\n3. `archivePerOffsetBatchRecords` - It archives all the available records in the per offset tracked batch passed to this function.\r\n4.  `archiveCompleteBatch` - It archives all the available records of the complete batch passed to this function.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe added functionality has been tested with unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Suppression\r\nIn order for build to pass, I had to add JavaNCSS suppression for `SharePartitionTest`. It takes into account the total lines of non-commented source code. Agreed, that we can optimize the current `SharePartitionTest` code at a few places, however, when we add new test cases, we will again breach this limit which is currently set at 1500. Hence, adding the suppression made sense to

change implements response handling for the new version of Vote, Fetch, FetchSnapshot, BeginQuorumEpoch and EndQuorumEpoch. All of these responses were extended to include the leader's endpoint when the leader is known.\r\n\r\nThis change also includes sending the new version of the requests for Vote, Fetch, FetchSnapshot, BeginQuorumEpoch and EndQuorumEpoch. The two most notable changes are that:\r\n1.  The leader is going to include all of its endpoints in the BeginQuorumEpoch and EndQuorumEpoch requests.\r\n2. The replica is going to include the destination replica key for the Vote and BeginQuorumEpoch request.\r\n\r\nQuorumState was extended so that the replica transitions to UnattachedState instead of FollowerState during startup, if the leader is known but the leader's endpoint is not known. This can happen if the known leader is not part of the voter set replicated by the replica. The expectation is that the replica will rediscover the leader from Fetch responses from the bootstrap servers or from the BeginQuorumEpoch request from the leader.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that replicas never forget the leader of a given epoch the unattached state was extended to allow an optional leader id for when the leader is known but the leader's endpoint is not known.\r\n\r\n### Committer
