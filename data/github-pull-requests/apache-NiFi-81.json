is a big PR, and there is some helpful information before delving into the code. \r\n\r\n# What is it?\r\n\r\nThe `EncryptedWriteAheadProvenanceRepository` is a new implementation of the provenance repository which encrypts all event record information before it is written to the repository. This allows for storage on systems where OS-level access controls are not sufficient to protect the data while still allowing querying and access to the data through the NiFi UI/API. \r\n\r\n# How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe code will provide more details, and I plan to write extensive documentation for the Admin Guide and User Guide [NIFI-3721](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3721), but this will suffice for an overview. \r\n\r\nThe `WriteAheadProvenanceRepository` was introduced by @markap14 in [NIFI-3356](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3356) and provided a refactored and much faster provenance repository implementation than the previous `PersistentProvenanceRepository`. The encrypted version wraps that implementation with a record writer and reader which encrypt and decrypt the serialized bytes respectively. \r\n\r\nThe fully qualified class `org.apache.nifi.provenance.EncryptedWriteAheadProvenanceRepository` is specified as the provenance repository implementation in `nifi.properties` as the value of `nifi.provenance.repository.implementation`. In addition, new properties must be populated to allow successful initialization. \r\n\r\nThe simplest configuration is below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnifi.provenance.repository.debug.frequency=100\r\nnifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.provider.implementation=org.apache.nifi.provenance.StaticKeyProvider\r\nnifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.provider.location=\r\nnifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.id=Key1\r\nnifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key=0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA98765432100123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA9876543210\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `nifi.provenance.repository.debug.frequency` is a new configuration option to control the rate at which debug messages regarding performance statistics are printed to the logs (in *DEBUG* mode)\r\n* `nifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.provider.implementation` is the **Key Provider** implementation. A key provider is the datastore interface for accessing the encryption key to protect the provenance events. There are currently two implementations -- `StaticKeyProvider` which reads a key directly from `nifi.properties`, and `FileBasedKeyProvider` which reads *n* many keys from an encrypted file. The interface is extensible, and HSM-backed or other providers are expected in the future. \r\n* `nifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.provider.location` is the location of the key provider data. For `StaticKeyProvider`, this is left blank. For `FileBasedKeyProvider`, this is a file path to the key provider definition file (e.g. `./keys.nkp`). For an HSM or other provider, this could be a URL, etc. \r\n* `nifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.id` is the *key ID* which is used to encrypt the events. \r\n* `nifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key` is the hexadecimal encoding of the key for the `StaticKeyProvider`. For `FileBasedKeyProvider`, this value is left blank. This value can also be encrypted by using the `encrypt-config.sh` tool in the NiFi Toolkit, and is marked as sensitive by default. \r\n\r\nThe `FileBasedKeyProvider` implementation reads from an encrypted definition file of the format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey1=NGCpDpxBZNN0DBodz0p1SDbTjC2FG5kp1pCmdUKJlxxtcMSo6GC4fMlTyy1mPeKOxzLut3DRX+51j6PCO5SznA==\r\nkey2=GYxPbMMDbnraXs09eGJudAM5jTvVYp05XtImkAg4JY4rIbmHOiVUUI6OeOf7ZW+hH42jtPgNW9pSkkQ9HWY/vQ==\r\nkey3=SFe11xuz7J89Y/IQ7YbJPOL0/YKZRFL/VUxJgEHxxlXpd/8ELA7wwN59K1KTr3BURCcFP5YGmwrSKfr4OE4Vlg==\r\nkey4=kZprfcTSTH69UuOU3jMkZfrtiVR/eqWmmbdku3bQcUJ/+UToecNB5lzOVEMBChyEXppyXXC35Wa6GEXFK6PMKw==\r\nkey5=c6FzfnKm7UR7xqI2NFpZ+fEKBfSU7+1NvRw+XWQ9U39MONWqk5gvoyOCdFR1kUgeg46jrN5dGXk13sRqE0GETQ==\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach line defines a key ID and then the Base64-encoded cipher text of a 16 byte IV and wrapped AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 key depending on the JCE policies available. The individual keys are wrapped by AES/GCM encryption using the **master key** defined by `nifi.bootstrap.sensitive.key` in `conf/bootstrap.conf`. \r\n\r\nOnce the repository is initialized, all provenance event record write operations are serialized according to the configured schema writer (`EventIdFirstSchemaRecordWriter` by default for `WriteAheadProvenanceRepository`) to a `byte[]`. Those bytes are then encrypted using an implementation of `ProvenanceEventEncryptor` (the only current implementation is `AES/GCM/NoPadding`) and the encryption metadata (`keyId`, `algorithm`, `version`, `IV`) is serialized and prepended. The complete `byte[]` is then written to the repository on disk as normal. \r\n\r\n![Encrypted provenance repository file on disk](https://i.imgur.com/BCpQoBl.png)\r\n\r\nOn record read, the process is reversed. The encryption metadata is parsed and used to decrypt the serialized bytes, which are then deserialized into a `ProvenanceEventRecord` object. The delegation to the normal schema record writer/reader allows for \"random-access\" (i.e. immediate seek without decryption of unnecessary records). \r\n\r\nWithin the NiFi UI/API, there is no detectable difference between an encrypted and unencrypted provenance repository. The Provenance Query operations work as expected with no change to the process. \r\n\r\n# Performance\r\n\r\nWhile there is an obvious performance cost to cryptographic operations, I tried to minimize the impact and to provide an estimate of the metrics of this implementation in comparison to existing behavior. \r\n\r\nIn general, with low flow event volume, the performance impact is not noticeable -- it is perfectly inline with `WriteAheadProvenanceRepository` and more than twice as fast as the existing `PersistentProvenanceRepository`. \r\n\r\n![Small event size, low volume](http://i.imgur.com/kc35VJL.png)\r\n\r\nWith a much higher volume of events, the impact is felt in two ways. First, the throughput of the flow is slower, as more resources are dedicated to encrypting and serializing the events (note the total events processed/events per second). In addition, the provenance queries are slightly slower than the original implementation (1% - 17%), and significantly slower than the new `WriteAheadProvenanceRepository` operating in plaintext (~110%). This is a known trade-off that will need to be evaluated by the deployment administrator given their threat model and risk assessment. \r\n\r\n![Small event size, high volume](https://i.imgur.com/M8jg75V.png)\r\n\r\n# Remaining Efforts\r\n* Documentation -- as noted above, this effort is captured in [NIFI-3721](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3721)\r\n* Logging data leakage -- in various places, I noted that with logs set to *DEBUG*, the `LuceneEventIndex` printed substantial information from the event record to the log. If the repository is encrypted, an administrator would reasonably expect this potentially-sensitive information not to be printed to the logs. In this specific instance, I changed the log statements to elide this information, but an audit needs to occur for the complete project to detect other instances where this may occur. Ideally, this could be variable depending on the encryption status of the repository, but this would require changing the method signature, and I didn't want to tackle that now. This is captured in [NIFI-3388](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3388)\r\n* Other implementations -- While AES/GCM is (in my opinion) the best option for event encryption (it is AEAD which provides confidentiality and integrity, very fast, and does not need to be compatible with any external system), users may have requirements/requests for other algorithms\r\n* Other key providers -- as noted above, HSM is probably the biggest, but other software-based secure data stores like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) or [KeyWhiz](https://square.github.io/keywhiz/), or JCEKS-backed to be compatible with Hadoop systems may be necessary\r\n* Refactoring shared code -- as part of the effort to provide encrypted repositories for content and flowfiles, some of this code will likely be moved to other modules\r\n\r\n# Potential Issues\r\n* Key rotation -- If a user wants to rotate the keys used, `StaticKeyProvider` does not provide a mechanism to support this. With `FileBasedKeyProvider`, they can simply specify a new key in the key provider file with `nifi.provenance.repository.encryption.key.id` in `nifi.properties` and future events will be encrypted with that key. Previously-encrypted events can still be decrypted as long as that key is still available in the key definition file\r\n* Switching between unencrypted and encrypted repositories\r\n    - If a user has an existing repository that is not encrypted and switches their configuration to use an encrypted repository, the application writes an error to the log but starts up. However, previous events are not accessible through the provenance query interface and new events will overwrite the existing events. The same behavior occurs if a user switches from an encrypted repository to an unencrypted repository [NIFI-3722](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3722)\r\n    - We should provide logic to handle encrypted -> unencrypted seamlessly as long as the key provider available still has the keys used to encrypt the events (see **Key Rotation**)\r\n    - We should provide logic to handle unencrypted -> encrypted seamlessly as the previously recorded events simply need to be read with a plaintext schema record reader and then written back with the encrypted record writer\r\n    - We should also provide a standalone tool in NiFi Toolkit to encrypt/decrypt an existing provenance repository to make the transition easier. The translation process could take a long time depending on the size of the existing repository, and being able to perform this task outside of application startup would be valuable [NIFI-3723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3723)\r\n* Multiple repositories -- No additional effort or testing has been applied to multiple repositories at this time. It is possible/likely issues will occur with repositories on different physical devices. There is no option to provide a heterogenous environment (i.e. one encrypted, one plaintext repository). \r\n* Corruption -- when a disk is filled or corrupted, there have been reported issues with the repository becoming corrupted and recovery steps are necessary. This is likely to continue to be an issue with the encrypted repository, although still limited in scope to individual records (i.e. an entire repository file won't be irrecoverable due to the encryption)\r\n* Shutdown -- I noticed that switching from `PersistentProvenanceRepository` to `EncryptedWriteAheadProvenanceRepository` led to slower NiFi app shutdowns [NIFI-3712](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3712). This was repeatable with `WriteAheadProvenanceRepository`, so I don't believe it is dependent on the encryption changes\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR addresses the issue mentioned on NIFI-3520 regarding using the \"Additional Resources\" property on the HDFS processors. The fix is a fundamental refactoring of how the instance class loading isolation works.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Fixing FlowController to use appropriate class loader when instantiating processor\r\n- Updating ExtensionManager to leverage new MANIFEST entry to know when to stop including resources from parent class loaders\r\n- Adding ReloadComponent interface and refactoring instance class loading to use it\r\n- Fixing FetchHDFS issue with TDE by using ugi.doAs\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-29T19:55:52Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T17:52:11Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T17:52:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ff1d5ed734075a006a9c4e13b7be683871b48df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/1635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/1635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/372c265c51419aef677e162d44cf6367e654001c","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-3520-2","ref":"NIFI-3520-2","sha":"372c265c51419aef677e162d44cf6367e654001c","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

It allows me to schedule multiple calls to the ``onTrigger`` method with a given duration between each call so that I can check what happens in case of events occurring while the processor is running (without calling ``onScheduled``). With this new parameter, I added a unit test where a new file is created while the processor is running to check that the processor picks up the new file as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it is not possible to have multi-tenancy when using Kafka processors: a single JAAS configuration file must be set in JVM variables to allow communication with Kerberos enabled Kafka cluster. Since the release of Kafka client 0.10.2, this has been improved and it gives the possibility to define a Login Module at processor level.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the tests performed: on a standalone NiFi instance, only the ``krb5.conf`` file path has been set in ``nifi.properties``. And the following workflow has been used:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1009\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-21 at 4 06 44 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11541012/24154067/7546606a-0e50-11e7-9502-d6607fd3f3fd.png\">\r\n\r\nEach Publish/Consume is using its own pair of user keytab/principal and consume/publish from/to a queue where correct ACLs have been set for the corresponding users. By looking at the audit logs, we can confirm that the authentication on each queue is correctly performed and that we have the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I used the following JAAS input as the standard:\r\n````\r\n    KafkaClient {\r\n       com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\r\n       useTicketCache=false\r\n       renewTicket=true\r\n       serviceName=\"kafka\"\r\n       useKeyTab=true\r\n       keyTab=\"/path/to/keytab\"\r\n       principal=\"principal@EXAMPLE.COM\";\r\n    };\r\n````\r\nand I only exposed the keytab and principal as new properties. The other properties are not exposed but that's something we could add if

this fix, ConnectWebSocket has to be restarted manually if its target WebSocket server restarted, or session expiration if there's no communication more than certain period of time (looks 3 min). This PR adds automatic session maintenance logic so that ConnectWebSocket keeps its session alive as long as it's running. \r\n\r\n- Removed unused disconnect method from WebSocketService interface.\r\n- Added session maintenance background thread at JettyWebSocketClient\r\n  which reconnects sessions those are still referred by ConnectWebSocket\r\n  processor but no longer active.\r\n- Added Session Maintenance Interval property to JettyWebSocketClient.\r\n- Allowed specifying existing session id so that it can be recovered\r\n  transparently.\r\n- Moved test classes to appropriate package.\r\n- Added test cases that verify the same session id can be used after\r\n  WebSocket server restarts.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [
