algebra operators are now restructured to following interfaces (and cuda support has been added):\r\n\r\n- c_lapack_api.h : Header to integrate lapack functions on CPU\r\n\r\n- linalg.h:  Tensor based interface to call linear algebra operators on gpu/cpu in a unified way\r\n\r\n- la_op.cc/la_op.cu: Operators that expose these functions to a user. \r\n\r\nThe whole implementation of cpu/gpu handling is in linalg_impl.h. It turned out that there are various specialties when dealing with cuBlas/cuSolver for the different functionalities, so decided to hide this in a separate file and not clutter the interface (linalg.h) with all these details. \r\n\r\nWe are planning to add more functions in the future (and other people are planning this too). So hopefully we can ensure that this structure is used as much as possible for new additional linear algebra functionalities. \r\n\r\nThis PR requires PR 274 for mshadow as prerequisite. \r\n\r\nThe CUDA functions still have to be tested. Am in the process of doing so but would like to send the changes already now for review.

please find a summary of changes made for sparse tensor feature on CPU. \r\n\r\nNote: this PR contains duplicate code in PR #7015 \r\n\r\n# Frontend Interfaces\r\n\r\n## NDArray Class Hierarchy \r\n\r\n-> NDArrayBase (root)\r\n-> NDArray\r\n-> SparseNDArray\r\n-> RowSparseNDArray, CSRNDArray\r\n\r\n## Sparse Storage Types Overview\r\n\r\nTwo storage formats are supported: `row_sparse` and `csr`. \r\n\r\n- [`row_sparse`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/sparse/python/mxnet/ndarray/sparse_ndarray.py#L378) tensors, typically used for sparse gradient updates (similar to [`tf.IndexedSlice`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/IndexedSlices)) \r\n\r\n- [`csr`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/sparse/python/mxnet/ndarray/sparse_ndarray.py#L331) tensors, with the [standard csr storage format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_.28CSR.2C_CRS_or_Yale_format.29). \r\n\r\n## Functionality Overview\r\n### operators with sparse inputs\r\nA list of operators in this PR include:\r\n\r\n* Arithmetics: `elemwise_add(row_sparse)`, `dot(csr, row_sparse)`, `dot(csr, dense)`\r\n* Conversion: `cast_storage(csr<->dense)`, `cast_storage(row_sparse<->dense)`\r\n* Indexing: [`sparse_retain(row_sparse)`](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/sparse/src/operator/tensor/indexing_op.cc#L232), `slice(csr)`\r\n* Creation: `zeros(row_sparse)`, `zeros(csr)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### iterators and IO utils functions\r\n- `NDArrayIter` with `CSRNDArray`\r\n- `LibsvmIter` which reads files in libsvm format and produces `CSRNDArray`\r\n- load/save `RowSparseNDArray`/`CSRNDArray`\r\n\r\n### kvstore and optimizer with sparse gradient updates\r\n- `sgd_update(row_sparse)` and `sgd_mom_update(row_sparse)` will update rows of the weight where the gradient of the row contains nonzeros.\r\n- `kv.push` with row_sparse gradient, which only sends over the nonzero gradients over the network\r\n- `kv.row_sparse_pull` with row_ids, which only pulls back a RowSparseNDArray with specified row_id over the network\r\n\r\n### unsupported functionality \r\nThere's a list of basic functionality supported in NDArray, but is either not supported or inefficient in SparseNDArray:\r\n- get/set an element in CSRNDArray/RowSparseNDArray by index (not supported)\r\n- `reshape` in CSRNDArray/RowSparseNDArray (not supported)\r\n- `_slice`, `_at` in CSRNDArray/RowSparseNDArray (not supported)\r\n- inplace add/sub/mul/div/mod, `broadcast_to` in CSRNDArray/RowSparseNDArray (not efficient)\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the TODO list for a list of ongoing/planned operators.\r\n\r\n# Backend Interfaces\r\n\r\n## NDArray\r\n\r\nNDArray uses `storage_type` to determine what storage format to use to represent a tensor.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nenum NDArrayStorageType {\r\n  kUndefinedStorage = -1,  // undefined storage\r\n  kDefaultStorage,         // dense\r\n  kRowSparseStorage,       // row sparse\r\n  kCSRStorage,             // csr\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of the important interfaces added to NDArray are:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nNDArray {\r\n  // constructor\r\n  NDArray(const NDArrayStorageType stype, const TShape &shape, Context ctx,\r\n          bool delay_alloc = true, int dtype = mshadow::default_type_flag,\r\n          std::vector<int> aux_types = {}, std::vector<TShape> aux_shapes = {},\r\n          TShape storage_shape = TShape(mshadow::Shape1(0)))\r\n  // memory allocation\r\n  void CheckAndAllocData(const TShape &storage_shape) const; \r\n  void CheckAndAllocAuxData(size_t i, const TShape &aux_shape) const;\r\n\r\n  struct Chunk {\r\n    Storage::Handle shandle;\r\n    // storage handles for aux data (e.g. indptr, indices)\r\n    std::vector<Storage::Handle> aux_handles;\r\n    NDArrayStorageType storage_type;\r\n    std::vector<int> aux_types;\r\n    TShape storage_shape;\r\n    std::vector<TShape> aux_shapes;\r\n    void CheckAndAllocData(const TShape &shape, int dtype);\r\n    void CheckAndAllocAuxData(size_t i, const TShape &shape);\r\n  };\r\n...\r\n\r\n void CopyFromTo(const NDArray &from, NDArray *to) {\r\n    // if storage_types of from & to don't match, convert to destination storage type\r\n    // perform copy...\r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Executor and NNVM\r\n\r\n### operator interface\r\n\r\nTo deal with tensors of non-default storage, operators need to register with the following interface:\r\n```cpp\r\nusing FComputeEx = std::function<void (\r\n        const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n        const OpContext& ctx,\r\n        const std::vector<NDArray>& inputs,\r\n        const std::vector<OpReqType>& req,\r\n        const std::vector<NDArray>& outputs)>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince memory usage for sparse tensor cannot be calculated during graph binding phase, operator is expected to use `CheckAndAllocAuxData` and `CheckAndAllocData` to perform memory allocation for result tensors at runtime. \r\n\r\n### infer_storage_type pass \r\n\r\nBesides `FInferShape` and `FInferType`, an operator needs to register `FInferStorageType` if it involves non-default storage_type. `ctx` could be used to infer if MKL experimental memory should be used.  The attribute `__storage_type__` of `mx.sym.Variable` is read for this pass.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nusing FInferStorageType = std::function<bool (\r\n        const NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n        const Context& ctx,\r\n        std::vector<int>* in_attrs,\r\n        std::vector<int>* out_attrs)>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen binding a graph, `InferStorageType` pass will be applied to infer graph entries with unknown storage_type. The pass is implemented in MXNet instead of NNVM. `infer_type` and `infer_shape` passes are both moved from NNVM to MXNet.\r\n\r\n### plan_memory pass\r\n\r\nFor node entries of non-default storage_type, they're annotated with `kDynamicStorageID`; memory are neither requested nor released. No memory sharing optimization is applied. \r\n\r\n### memory allocation and sharing\r\n\r\nFor node entries of `kDefaultStorage`(i.e. dense storage), memory allocation and sharing is done as usual. For node entries of non-default storage_type, memory allocation is delayed to runtime. No memory sharing is applied to these entries even when `shared_exec` is provided.\r\n\r\n### executor dispatch and storage fallback\r\n\r\nFor each node in graph, if it involves non-default storage in either its inputs or outputs, `FComputeExExecutor` will be created if `FComputeEx` attribute is registered. \r\n\r\nIf `FComputeEx` is not registered, an `FComputeExcutor`/`FStatefulComputeExcutor` will be created, inputs with non-default storage will be converted to NDArrays with default (i.e. dense) storage; the outputs will be converted back to non-default storage if necessary. The converted NDArrays are temporary and will be released when there's no reference to them.\r\n\r\n## kvstore\r\n\r\nSparse gradient update requires a parameter to be initialized as row_sparse format in kvstore. If an optimizer is registered with `FComputeEx`, then the update may only involve the rows with non-zero gradients. Gradients are sent in `row_sparse` format to reduce the stress on network bandwidth. \r\n\r\nFor distributed training, `kRowSparsePushPull` mode is introduced so that row ids of the row_sparse gradients are encoded as keys by kvstore workers. When the kvstore server receives the message, it constructs a row_sparse gradient NDArray based on the row ids decoded from it and applies the optimizer to the weight. The memory for parameters are pre-allocated on parameter servers, instead of storing weight row by row.\r\n\r\n\r\n# TODO list\r\n## Operators\r\n- elemwise binary & unary operators (row_sparse): done, to be merged in another PR\r\n  negative, square, abs, sqrt, round, ceil, floor, fix, elemwise_add, elemwise_sub, elemwise_div, elemwise_mul, _maximum, _minimum, _mul_scalar\r\n- elemwise binary & unary operators (csr): ongoing\r\n  negative, square, broadcast_mul, _mul_scalar\r\n- inplace broadcast_add, broadcast_sub, _mul_scalar operators\r\n- broadcast operators (csr)\r\n- broadcast operators (row_sparse)\r\n- elemwise operators(csr)\r\n- `_sync_copy_from` with `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` input\r\n- `asscipy` (csr)\r\n\r\n\r\n## kvstore and optimizer \r\n- lazy initialization - postpone parameter initialization to kvstore server\r\n- storing `row_sparse` weight by rows to support weights of > 2 billion rows.

this PR for interface review:\r\n\r\n- Added `row_sparse_pull` python API to kvstore and c_api, which requires providing `row_id` for each row_sparse `value` to pull. The `row_id`s are sorted in backend to contain only unique elements. The old `pull` API will not accept pulling a `value` stored in row_sparse storage\r\n- Added `kRowSparsePushPull` type to kvstore server. When received data request of this type, keys are encoded as `key, row_id1, row_id2 ... row_idn`. \r\n- Added temporary support for SparseNDArray inplace add/mul/div/sub by making an extra copy in frontend explicitly\r\n- See regression example using `row_sparse_pull` in regression_example.py\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- this PR contains duplicated code in PR #6765\r\n\r\nTODOs for next PR:\r\n- row_ids aggregation for multi-device row_sparse_pull in dist-kvstore\r\n- lazy initialization for large weights\r\n\r\n@mli @reminisce @piiswrong @madjam
