commit adds documentation for the builtins PCA and Scale.\r\n\r\nFor Scale we add a NaN handling on internally calculated vectors, to allow the Scale builtin to work on inputs containing NaN, by essentially not scaling or shifting columns containing NaN.\r\n\r\nPCA now include some code examples in the documentation and minor modifications such as a new argument onlyClusters that allow us to call PCA without having to apply the calculated eigenvectors to the input matrix. This modification is done because other instances i want to compare with only calculate PCA while not applying it. Also added is some minor comments inside PCA and removal of a matrix multiplication that is never used (and so far always compiled out as dead code when executing PCA)","created_at":"2023-04-21T10:00:02Z","updated_at":"2023-04-23T12:39:10Z","closed_at":"2023-04-23T12:39:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc5945c3af48843df7a7674a730c47a351905aa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1807/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1807/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1807/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/da138a6729a0d079a656a9e667d3d213fd83415a","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:BuiltinScaleAndPCA","ref":"BuiltinScaleAndPCA","sha":"da138a6729a0d079a656a9e667d3d213fd83415a","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

jacoco code coverage to java tests in github actions.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nAs a user and developer in the SystemDS project, I want to have metrics to track the health of the project. Test coverage is one helpful indicator to track with the development of new features to ensure that coverage does not drop over time. The project uses github-actions for testing PRs and this is a helpful place to review the health metrics. Adding test-coverage for java components is non-trivial for the github actions, since the java tests have been parallelized over many executors in github-workflows, and the results need to be aggregated to generate a report or evaluation.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to merge the existing java-test workflows into one in order to cleanly use the github-actions API within a workflow template for sharing files between jobs. It may have been possible to use the REST-API, but that would have increased the complexity of the implementation and been bad for maintainability. \r\n\r\nIt may be possible, that the limits of jobs within one workflow are more restrictive, and before merging the documentation should be reviewed and cited.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not yet complete, and the issue will only be marked as closed in a later comment.","created_at":"2023-04-21T09:26:36Z","updated_at":"2023-05-01T09:22:17Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T12:50:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3a71a7f42a298c8d3f8f0e45df74c1bf71cb0d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/e8361403e7fe1478207fa5b19f2574fa4bdc0e0f","head":{"label":"kykrueger:main","ref":"main","sha":"e8361403e7fe1478207fa5b19f2574fa4bdc0e0f","user":{"login":"kykrueger","id":7158199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTgxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7158199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger","html_url":"https://github.com/kykrueger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":629658265,"node_id":"R_kgDOJYfSmQ","name":"systemds","full_name":"kykrueger/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kykrueger","id":7158199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTgxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7158199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger","html_url":"https://github.com/kykrueger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kykrueger/systemds","description":"An

patch reworks the GPU cache eviction (deletion). The free pointer cache stays empty when lineage cache is enabled. This patch allows recycling the cached pointers. We maintain two lists for live and free pointers in the cache. When the GPU memory is full, we poll the first entry from the free list (weighted queue) and recycle the pointer if the size matches the requested size, otherwise we deallocate the cached pointers till enough space is available.","created_at":"2023-03-26T13:38:22Z","updated_at":"2023-03-26T14:39:06Z","closed_at":"2023-03-26T14:39:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83c8d3bd07a238fd3a2ea6b871b23a082182c51c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/ecd7a400f08daf421b9ce6aa2ae6716acfb8be1d","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:gpulineage2","ref":"gpulineage2","sha":"ecd7a400f08daf421b9ce6aa2ae6716acfb8be1d","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch removes the asynchronous eviction of lineage cache entries from the GPU to main memory. Background eviction needs a compiler-assisted approach. A full runtime asynchronous eviction leads to synchronization issues. This patch also adds a flag to delete cache entries in GPU instead of coping to host.\r\nCurrently, for a mini-batch workload with limited reuse opportunities, enabling reuse in GPU slows down the execution by 10x with eviction (copy to host) and 4x with delete.","created_at":"2023-03-20T15:06:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T16:03:47Z","closed_at":"2023-03-20T16:03:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1f0337d04c76e1b5ee43dc87e9732ae4c422816","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/44f10dac5d42e0931ae2315cdc336ae0fa5b9f02","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:gpulineage1","ref":"gpulineage1","sha":"44f10dac5d42e0931ae2315cdc336ae0fa5b9f02","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

simply that when reading a dense block we called allocateDenseBlock(false), and based on the output of this we reset the block. But if the block is already allocated by allocate Dense block we do not need to reset it again afterwards (that would be redundant).","created_at":"2023-03-19T13:02:20Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T08:54:27Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T08:54:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09404a0d93c9a73e4f0649a4dcd69bb10633e7ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1791/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1791/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1791/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/1169d46ee7ee7daff693af889febf31cc213f27d","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:readNoResetIfDenseReadBinary","ref":"readNoResetIfDenseReadBinary","sha":"1169d46ee7ee7daff693af889febf31cc213f27d","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

observed that the compile time if we include IO operations increase to ~0.6 sec. While if we do not have IO operations it is ~0.2 sec. This is due to the hadoop IO we are using taking up to 70% of the compile time in cases where we have simple scripts with only read and a single operation. This is a constant overhead on the fist IO operation that does not effect subsequent IO operations, to improve this I have moved this to a parallel operation when we construct the JobConfiguration. This improve the compile time of systemds in general from ~0.6 sec when using IO to ~0.2 sec.","created_at":"2023-01-03T11:45:42Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T22:37:48Z","closed_at":"2023-01-04T20:53:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01808f4726c8b4a1c3e8184432f74e8e6fdd876b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/92e33718d296aabfc1a2f136226595c10879e5a4","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:StartUpParallel","ref":"StartUpParallel","sha":"92e33718d296aabfc1a2f136226595c10879e5a4","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch adds the compiler flags and runtime support to checkpoint any Spark instruction which is marked for caching. During postprocessing of a marked instruction, we first inplace persist the RDD and then store the RDD in the local Lineage cache for reuse. This patch also fixes a bug in the last commit which was unpersisting the locally cached RDDs during rmvar. Future commits will add rewrites to mark the Spark instructions for caching in a cost-based manner.\r\nHyperparameter tuning of LmDS with 2.5k columns improves by 22x by caching the cpmm results in the executors.","created_at":"2022-12-21T20:51:16Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T22:57:04Z","closed_at":"2022-12-21T22:57:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43e90eb0874c45cf90b4802b3188b53a4acbcc14","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/8e22060c0428a417bfc65b00a00cc07f7fb7ac6e","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:rddpersist2","ref":"rddpersist2","sha":"8e22060c0428a417bfc65b00a00cc07f7fb7ac6e","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch extends lineage cache to store the RDD objects which are checkpointed. This addition allows the compiler to place a chkpoint after a potentially redundant operator. During runtime, we then persist the RDD, save the RDD in the lineage cache, and reuse if the instruction repeats. It is a bit tricky to cache a RDD for a lineage trace of a previous instruction. A better way would be to be able to mark any instruction to persist the result RDD and skip the chkpoint instruction.\r\nHyperparameter tuning of LmDS with 2.5k columns improves by 4x by caching the cpmm results in the executors.","created_at":"2022-12-16T22:31:21Z","updated_at":"2022-12-17T16:00:59Z","closed_at":"2022-12-17T16:00:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11482a663d951969777d667c572f567f0207cd70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1751/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1751/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1751/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/d59b63f5c04d88c69536f0498660a66019cdc654","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:rddpersist1","ref":"rddpersist1","sha":"d59b63f5c04d88c69536f0498660a66019cdc654","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch converts the existing unique() function from a script to a built-in. The script-based approach is based on sorting, which is very expensive computationally, especially for large multiblock inputs. The new approach, on the other hand, is based on a new data sketch for the unique() function. This first patch creates the framework for the new unique sketch and implements the CP RowCol case; other cases - CP Row/Col and Spark RowCol/Row/Col - will be implemented in subsequent

patch introduces a new heuristic-based operator linearization order, which aims to maximize inter-operator parallelism among Spark and local operators. We first traverse the LOP DAGs to collect the roots of the Spark operator chains and the number of Spark instructions in all subDAGs. We then first place the Spark operator chains followed by the CP lanes. Finally, we place the appropriate asynchronous operators to trigger the Spark operator chains in parallel.\r\nThis change along with the future-based execution of Spark actions and a manual reuse of partitioned broadcast variables improve lmDS by 2x.","created_at":"2022-11-25T13:45:12Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T20:12:26Z","closed_at":"2022-11-25T16:47:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db19b984c1354946bf8fc0ff70bd5af48276e0fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/8d7e45c3c7c3b6b30eda5a3bdeceb89d940c577b","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:oporder1","ref":"oporder1","sha":"8d7e45c3c7c3b6b30eda5a3bdeceb89d940c577b","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

Description\r\nThis patch adds support for running countDistinct() builtin on the Spark backend. The implementation adds a new CountDistinctFunctionSketch to the sketches library. The sketch is based on an optimized HashMap lookup:\r\n    Let [sign (1) | exponent (11) | fraction (52)] represent the bits of a double value\r\n\r\n    - Each double is split into 2 parts:\r\n        - PartA: [sign (1) | exponent (11)] and\r\n        - PartB: [fraction (52)]\r\n    - PartA is used as the key into the HashMap, and PartB is stored in the Set<Long> value\r\n    - Many values in blkIn may have the same exponent, so we need to store multiple PartB values for any given PartA key\r\n    - The HashMap is then serialized into the sketch like so:\r\n        row_i: [exponent_i, N_i, fraction_i0, fraction_i1, .., fraction_iN, 0, .., 0]\r\n\r\n        - exponent_i: it is the short int value of the bit representation of the original double input\r\n        - N_i: we store the number of fractions per exponent value to avoid dealing with jagged matrices\r\n    \r\nNB: Although countDistinct() does not strictly require us to keep track of the individual input elements, we must do so in the sketch so we can support the union() op for the MULTI_BLOCK case (see notes below)\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, blkIn can have 1000x1000 = 10e6 unique values. Therefore, total memory is bounded above by:\r\n```\r\n    Max of\r\n        (10e6 * 2) + (10e6 * 8) bytes   -> 10e6 keys, each with a single value\r\n            and 2 + (10e6 * 8) bytes    -> a single key, with unique 10e6 fraction parts\r\n    = (10e6 * 2) + (10e6 * 8) = 10e6 * 10 bytes < 10 MB\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes to Reviewers\r\n    - The current implementation only supports the SINGLE_BLOCK case, i.e. the current implementation works for input matrices of max size 1000 x 1000. Larger inputs (along either dimension) will throw a `NotImplementedException`. MULTI_BLOCK aggregation support will be added in a future patch.\r\n    - This patch adds support for only the default RowCol direction; we will add support for Row/Col direction in a future patch.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n    [X] Unit tests\r\n    [ ] Integration tests\r\n    [ ]
