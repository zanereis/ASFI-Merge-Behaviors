I think this is undesirable and for testing purposes you would only want to run one single run of a DAG. Therefore (just like `airflow task test`), it takes a required argument `execution_date` for which a DagRun is created.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6765](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6765)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

Speed up mypy runs.\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n\r\n1. It enables the mypy cache (default folder name .mypy_cache) so that\r\n   repeated runs locally are quicker\r\n2. It _disables_ passing only the changed files in.\r\n\r\nPoint 2 seems counter-intuitave, but in my testing running with all\r\nfiles (airflow docs tests) was about twice as fast as without. My\r\nhypothesis for why this happens is that when mypy is checking file x, it\r\nhas to check dependencies/imports for it too, and when we have\r\npass_filenames set runs multiple processes in parallel, and each of them\r\nhave to do this work!\r\n\r\nTimings before and after:\r\n\r\n- Before:\r\n\r\n  For all files\r\n  ```\r\n  ❯ time pre-commit run mypy -a\r\n  Run mypy.................................................................Passed\r\n  pre-commit run mypy -a  0.31s user 0.07s system 2% cpu 17.140 total\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  With only a single file\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  ❯ time pre-commit run mypy --files airflow/configuration.py\r\n  Run mypy.................................................................Passed\r\n  pre-commit run mypy --files airflow/configuration.py  0.30s user 0.07s system 5% cpu 6.724 total\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- After:\r\n\r\n  With a clean cache (`rm -rf .mypy_cache`):\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ time pre-commit run mypy\r\n  Run mypy.................................................................Passed\r\n  pre-commit run mypy -a  0.26s user 0.10s system 2% cpu 17.226 total\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Clean cache with single file:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ time pre-commit run mypy  --file airflow/version.py\r\n  Run mypy.................................................................Passed\r\n  pre-commit run mypy --file airflow/version.py  0.23s user 0.07s system 4% cpu 7.091 total\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Repeated run (cache folder exists):\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ time pre-commit run mypy  --file airflow/version.py\r\n  Run mypy.................................................................Passed\r\n  pre-commit run mypy --file airflow/version.py  0.23s user 0.05s system 6% cpu 4.178 total\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  and for all files\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  airflow ❯ time pre-commit run mypy  -a\r\n  Run mypy.................................................................Passed\r\n  pre-commit run mypy -a  0.25s user 0.09s system 6% cpu 4.833 total\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: `Document only change, no JIRA issue`\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

had copied whole-sale the baselayout.html from FAB and customized it, but pre-existing mechanism in flask/jinja of template inheritance means we don't have to do this.\r\n\r\nWe can instead extend the template from FAB and change the few blocks we need to.\r\n\r\nI have written this PR as two commits -- one to move the file without any changes (we can't extend `appbuilder/baselayout.html` from FAB

PR changes the following DAG info methods to POST:\r\n* `/dag_stats`\r\n* `/task_stats`\r\n* `/last_dagruns`\r\n* `/blocked`\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is described in the JIRA ticket:\r\n\r\n > It appears that the URL uses a `dag_ids` parameter that is a comma separated list in the GET request. Since DAGs can have a `dag_id` length of [250 characters](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/97a429f9d0cf740c5698060ad55f11e93cb57b55/airflow/models/base.py#L35) and the UI will show up to 100 DAGs per page, this means that the URL parameters alone could be 25,000 characters (not including domain, etc.). It seems that it might be best to switch this request over to POST to accommodate the potentially large request body.\r\n\r\nHere is a small DAG file I used to generate DAGs with excessively large names:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>EXPAND FOR CODE</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\r\n\r\n\r\ndef create_dag(dag_id,\r\n               schedule,\r\n               default_args):\r\n\r\n\r\n    dag = DAG(dag_id,\r\n              schedule_interval=schedule,\r\n              default_args=default_args)\r\n\r\n    with dag:\r\n        t1 = DummyOperator(task_id='dummy_task')\r\n\r\n    return dag\r\n\r\n\r\n# build a dag for each number in range(100)\r\nfor n in range(0, 100):\r\n    dag_id = 'long_name_dag__' + f\"{n}\".zfill(235)\r\n\r\n    default_args = {'owner': 'airflow',\r\n                    'start_date': datetime(2018, 1, 1)\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n    schedule = None\r\n\r\n    globals()[dag_id] = create_dag(dag_id,\r\n                                  schedule,\r\n                                  default_args)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI was able to verify that the page loads correctly with the new changes.

the introduction of AIP-21, I corrected the test file names. Very often the file name in the application did not match the test file name.  Now I would like to prevent regression, so I add tests that detect typos in names. This will also force you to add tests.\r\n\r\nThis is an experiment that we can extend to other packages in the project in the future. \r\n\r\nCC: @coopergillan \r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6720](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6720)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

change is intended to simplify the statsd configuration and unify the configuration. Other components use import path to configure aplication e.g.. `pod_mutation_hook` or `auth_backend`. Configuration through plugins is very strange and may not be readable enough.  The configuration file for the configuration is a proven, stable and widely used solution. Plugins are an interesting idea, but they are not common.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6711)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.
