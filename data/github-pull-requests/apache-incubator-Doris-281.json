Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Remove some redundant code.\r\n2. Fix the issue with the state of MTMV task.\r\n3. Fix the case - test_create_mtmv.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. We used a retry policy to re-run the failed MTMV tasks, but we set the state to `FAILURE` during re-running the tasks. We should do this after all the retry runs fail.\r\n2. There are some redundant code can be removed.\r\n3. In the case test_create_mtmv, we created many background tasks to refresh the data. Some task may fail due to the concurrency and cause the test fail. Actually, we only need single one task to verify the functionality.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-17T07:03:12Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T03:25:37Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T15:08:13Z","merged_at":"2023-01-17T15:08:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"388d6235069eacafa8ea8ebe3b41eb42730805fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1.Compatible with the old optimizer, the sort and limit in the subquery will not take effect, just delete it directly.\r\n```\r\nselect * from sub_query_correlated_subquery1 where sub_query_correlated_subquery1.k1 > (select sum(sub_query_correlated_subquery3.k3) a from sub_query_correlated_subquery3 where sub_query_correlated_subquery3.v2 = sub_query_correlated_subquery1.k2 order by a limit 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.Adjust the unnesting position of the subquery to ensure that the conjunct in the filter has been optimized, and then unnesting\r\n\r\nSupport:\r\n```\r\nSELECT DISTINCT k1 FROM sub_query_correlated_subquery1 i1 WHERE ((SELECT count(*) FROM sub_query_correlated_subquery1 WHERE ((k1 = i1.k1) AND (k2 = 2)) or ((k1 = i1.k1) AND (k2 = 1)) )  > 0);\r\n```\r\nThe reason why the above can be supported is that conjunction will be performed, which can be converted into the following\r\n```\r\nSELECT DISTINCT k1 FROM sub_query_correlated_subquery1 i1 WHERE ((SELECT count(*) FROM sub_query_correlated_subquery1 WHERE ((k1 = i1.k1) AND (k2 = 2 or k2 = 1)) )  >

= i1.k1) AND (k2 = 1)) )  > 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nI change the doc of multi-catalog and external table.\r\n\r\nNow there will be a first-class category named \"Lakehouse\" in doc sidebar.\r\nAnd the doc dir will be reorganized as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlakehouse/\r\n├── external-table\r\n│   ├── es.md\r\n│   ├── file.md\r\n│   ├── hive.md\r\n│   ├── jdbc.md\r\n│

multi-catalog.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the doc sidebar will looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n数据湖分析/\r\n├── 多源数据目录\r\n│   ├── 多源数据目录\r\n│   ├── Hive\r\n│   ├── Iceberg\r\n│   ├── Hudi\r\n│   └── ES\r\n│   └──

docs is no longer in `Ecosystem` category.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nI didn't write the english version, I will first checkout the result of Chinese docs,\r\nand then add english doc later.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n#### motivation\r\nIn the past, only simple predicates (`slot=const`), `and`, `like`, `or` (only bitmap index) could be pushed down to the storage layer. scan process:\r\n1. Read part of the column first, and calculate the row ids with a simple push-down predicate.\r\n2. Use row ids to read the remaining columns and pass them to the scanner, and the scanner filters the remaining predicates.\r\n\r\nThis pr will also push-down the remaining predicates (functions, nested predicates...) in the scanner to the storage layer for filtering. scan process:\r\n1. Read part of the column first, and use the push-down simple predicate to calculate the row ids, (same as above)\r\n2. Use row ids to read the columns needed for the remaining predicates, and use the pushed-down remaining predicates to reduce the number of row ids again.\r\n3. Use row ids to read the remaining columns and pass them to the scanner.\r\n\r\n#### expected\r\n1. `select a,b,c,... from tbl where func(a) = 1`. The performance will be significantly improved, and the effect depends on the number of selected columns and the filtering rate.\r\n    \r\nexample:  10 times better performance\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM hits WHERE UPPER(URL)=\"HTTP://SAMARA.IRR.RU/CATALOG_GOOGLETBR%26AD%3D278885%26BT%3D430001216\";\r\n```\r\n2. `select a from tbl where func(a) = 1`. Performance is expected to remain the same, as it behaves the same as before. \r\n(In the test, there is a 2% loss in performance. I found that `VExprContext::filter_block` performs differently in different locations, which may be related to cache miss, but the tool did not detect it)\r\n\r\n1. clickbench test\r\n\r\n|    test    | cost(s) |\r\n| ---------- | --- |\r\n| default | 134 |\r\n| set enable_remaining_expr_pushdown = true; |  110.25 |\r\n\r\ndefault:\r\n```\r\nquery1: 0.03,0.03,0.03\r\nquery2: 0.11,0.04,0.04\r\nquery3: 0.09,0.07,0.07\r\nquery4: 0.22,0.08,0.07\r\nquery5: 0.66,0.62,0.54\r\nquery6: 0.97,0.90,0.93\r\nquery7: 0.02,0.01,0.01\r\nquery8: 0.05,0.05,0.04\r\nquery9: 1.55,1.38,1.41\r\nquery10: 1.98,1.93,1.94\r\nquery11: 0.36,0.33,0.35\r\nquery12: 0.37,0.34,0.38\r\nquery13: 0.61,0.63,0.59\r\nquery14: 1.46,1.46,1.44\r\nquery15: 0.84,0.85,0.88\r\nquery16: 0.51,0.48,0.47\r\nquery17: 1.78,1.96,1.82\r\nquery18: 0.45,0.43,0.42\r\nquery19: 4.25,4.25,4.19\r\nquery20: 0.01,0.02,0.01\r\nquery21: 1.20,0.31,0.31\r\nquery22: 0.12,0.11,0.11\r\nquery23: 1.13,0.29,0.28\r\nquery24: 8.33,9.99,9.83\r\nquery25: 0.13,0.10,0.11\r\nquery26: 0.10,0.10,0.11\r\nquery27: 0.11,0.09,0.11\r\nquery28: 0.48,0.37,0.38\r\nquery29: 4.74,4.63,4.64\r\nquery30: 1.95,1.98,1.91\r\nquery31: 0.43,0.38,0.41\r\nquery32: 0.61,0.59,0.58\r\nquery33: 4.04,4.03,3.94\r\nquery34: 4.52,3.86,3.94\r\nquery35: 4.07,3.63,3.79\r\nquery36: 1.41,1.43,1.37\r\nquery37: 0.07,0.06,0.05\r\nquery38: 0.03,0.03,0.03\r\nquery39: 0.02,0.02,0.03\r\nquery40: 0.15,0.13,0.14\r\nquery41: 0.04,0.02,0.03\r\nquery42: 0.03,0.02,0.02\r\nquery43: 0.04,0.04,0.03\r\n```\r\n\r\nset enable_remaining_expr_pushdown = true;\r\n```\r\nquery1: 0.02,0.02,0.01\r\nquery2: 0.03,0.04,0.03\r\nquery3: 0.06,0.07,0.07\r\nquery4: 0.07,0.07,0.07\r\nquery5: 0.67,0.60,0.56\r\nquery6: 0.87,0.84,0.84\r\nquery7: 0.01,0.01,0.01\r\nquery8: 0.05,0.03,0.04\r\nquery9: 1.48,1.36,1.41\r\nquery10: 2.02,1.88,1.90\r\nquery11: 0.32,0.44,0.35\r\nquery12: 0.35,0.34,0.42\r\nquery13: 0.59,0.70,0.64\r\nquery14: 1.46,1.48,1.44\r\nquery15: 0.81,0.92,0.82\r\nquery16: 0.49,0.46,0.46\r\nquery17: 1.98,1.98,1.92\r\nquery18: 0.43,0.42,0.44\r\nquery19: 4.31,4.29,4.38\r\nquery20: 0.01,0.01,0.01\r\nquery21: 0.30,0.31,0.32\r\nquery22: 0.11,0.12,0.11\r\nquery23: 0.26,0.27,0.26\r\nquery24: 0.44,0.44,0.43\r\nquery25: 0.11,0.10,0.09\r\nquery26: 0.11,0.11,0.11\r\nquery27: 0.10,0.10,0.11\r\nquery28: 0.37,0.38,0.39\r\nquery29: 4.71,4.59,4.62\r\nquery30: 2.04,2.04,1.95\r\nquery31: 0.43,0.39,0.38\r\nquery32: 0.61,0.63,0.58\r\nquery33: 3.98,4.08,3.93\r\nquery34: 4.21,3.97,4.08\r\nquery35: 3.89,3.98,3.56\r\nquery36: 1.36,1.32,1.35\r\nquery37: 0.06,0.05,0.06\r\nquery38: 0.03,0.02,0.03\r\nquery39: 0.02,0.02,0.02\r\nquery40: 0.15,0.14,0.14\r\nquery41: 0.02,0.02,0.02\r\nquery42: 0.02,0.02,0.02\r\nquery43: 0.04,0.03,0.02\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe inferface of hive metastore changes from version to version.\r\nCurrently, Doris use hive 2.3.7 as hms client version.\r\nWhen using to connect hive 1.x, some interface such as `get_table_req` does not exist\r\nin hive 1.x. So we can't get metadata from hive 1.x.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I copied the HiveMetastoreClient from hive 2.3.7 release, and modify some of interface's\r\nimplementation, so that it will use old interface to connect to hive 1.x.\r\n\r\nAnd when creating hms catalog, you can specify the hive version, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE CATALOG `hive` PROPERTIES (\r\n  \"hive.metastore.uris\" = \"thrift://127.0.0.1:9083\",\r\n  \"type\" = \"hms\",\r\n  \"hive.version\" = \"1.1\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `hive.version` does not specified, Doris will use hive 2.3.x compatible interface to visit hms.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.
