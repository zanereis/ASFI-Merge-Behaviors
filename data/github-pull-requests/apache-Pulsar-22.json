Motivation\r\nSasl authentication has two phases. In the first phase, the broker will temporarily cache the authentication info, and clean the cache at the end of the second phase.\r\nWhen the client crashes after phase 1, or someone deliberately attacks, the auth info will always remain in the broker's memory. \r\nIf the client keeps reconnecting like this, the broker will soon OOM.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nChange ConcurrentHashMap to caffeine cache , and force  clean cache after a certain period of time.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x]

org.apache.pulsar.broker.intercept.BrokerInterceptors - Skip loading the broker interceptors when disableBrokerInterceptors is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee code of branch-2.11\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/dc258107d5019f513e2242eccb1551c956c72fed/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/web/ProcessHandlerFilter.java#L38-L53\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/dc258107d5019f513e2242eccb1551c956c72fed/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/intercept/BrokerInterceptors.java#L60-L64\r\n\r\nThe master branch has fixed the NPE by #19376. it's hard to cherry-pick that to branch-2.11.\r\nSo in order to keep the same logic, we need to revert #20422 first and then discuss if we should keep `disableBrokerInterceptors ` in the mail list.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#20702\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, `SecurityUtility.loadConscryptProvider()` logs full stacktrace when it fails to find Conscrypt on classpath and the exception is none

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, some `synchronized` is used in CompactedTopicImpl to avoid data contention, but it does not completely avoid data contention due to asynchronous operations and may lead to cursor skipping some data.\r\n\r\nThe cursor may skip some data due to `compactionHorizon` be updated:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/e360379cae536924ad1aebeda17e335cb9d61d6b/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/compaction/CompactedTopicImpl.java#L114\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Remove unnecessary `synchronized`.\r\n* Make `compactionHorizon` unchanged when reading compacted data.\r\n* Add `volatile` for  `compactedTopicContext`.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20591 \r\n- the original PR could not be reopened due to force push\r\n- see the context: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20595#discussion_r1247607547\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background of consumer reconnects**\r\n- grab connection: \r\n  - lookup the broker which owned the topic\r\n  - get the existing connection by the broker; create one if it does not exist\r\n- clear the messages in memory\r\n- send `CMD-subscribe` to the broker\r\n- send `flow permits` to broker to increment `availablePermits`\r\n\r\n**Background of scenarios that could trigger reconnection**: \r\n\r\n- Broker sends commands `cmd-close_consumer`, such as `unload topic`, `reset clusters`, and so on. \r\n- The connection was forcibly closed, such as the Broker disconnected or some things wrong with the network<sup>[1]</sup>.\r\n- Netty handler receives some exception(no matter what type ex)\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ClientCnx.java#L355\r\n- The customer actively reconnects if failed subscription.\r\n\r\n**Background of the response of broker received subscribe request**\r\nThe broker only response `success` if it receives a second `subscribe` request of the same consumer\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/ServerCnx.java#L1197\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI wanted to prevent this by adding a validation below to prevent the messages which in memory is cleared if the method `grabCnx` execute after the subscribe is finished, which result in messages being lost.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass consumerImpl {\r\n\r\n  public void connectionOpened(){\r\n    // the new check.\r\n    if (this.state == Ready){\r\n      return.\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I notice that there is a check `consumer.cnx == null` in the method `grabCnx`, because if the `state` of the consumer is `Ready`, the variable `cnx` of the consumer must not be null, so this test can be effective as the check `consumer.state != Ready`.\r\n\r\nAnd I notice another issue below:\r\n\r\n**Issue-1**\r\n\r\nIf the method `grab connection` is executed multi times, it will lose some messages due to a race condition, for example:\r\n\r\n| time | `grab connection 1` | `grab connection 2` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Check the variable `cnx` of the consumer is null | Check the variable `cnx` of the consumer is null | \r\n| 2 | Compare and set the variable `duringConnect` to `true` |\r\n| 3 | Get the connection from the pool |\r\n| 4 | Call `consumer.connectionOpened()` | \r\n| 4-1 | Clear messages in memory |\r\n| 4-2 | Set `consumer.cnx` |\r\n| 4-3 | Do subscribe and increase `availablePermits` |\r\n| 5 | Set the variable `duringConnect` to `false` |\r\n| 6 | receive 712 messages |\r\n| 7 | | Compare and set the variable `duringConnect` to `true` |\r\n| 8 | | Get connection from the pool |\r\n| 9 | | Call `consumer.connectionOpened()` | \r\n| 9-1 | | Clear messages in memory.<strong>(Highlight)</strong> 712 messages were lost |\r\n| 9-2 | | Set `consumer.cnx` |\r\n| 9-3 | | Do subscribe and increase `availablePermits` |\r\n| 10 | | Set the variable `duringConnect` to `false` |\r\n\r\nWe should make the check `consumer.cnx == null` execute after the check  `compare and set duringConnect.`\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**Issue-2**\r\n\r\nAfter we fixed the `issue-1`, the check `consumer.cnx == null` and the check `duringConnect == false` switch the order, the new issue occurs: `Since we use the variable `duringConnect` to prevent multi `grabCnx` running at the same time, we should make `set consumer.cnx to null` being executed before `set duringConnect to true` when the subscribe request fails. This can avoid the issue below:\r\n\r\n| time | `reconnect later` | `grab connection` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Compare and set the variable `duringConnect` to `false` | \r\n| 2 | | Compare and set the variable `duringConnect` to `true` |\r\n| 3 | | Check the variable `cnx` of the consumer is null | Check the variable `cnx` of the consumer is null(Since the task `reconnect later` has not executed `set consumer.cnx to null`, this check can not pass) | \r\n| 4 | `set consumer.cnx to null` |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Make the check consumer.cnx != null execute after the check compare and set duringConnect.\r\n- Make `set consumer.cnx to null` being executed before `set duringConnect to true` when the subscribe request fails\r\n- Change the log level to WARN if one consumer subscribe more than one times(the original log level is INFO), because it is not an expected behavior\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20688\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen a function throws an exception that ends processing, we should exit the JVM.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Update `JavaInstanceMain` so that an exception leads to exiting the JVM. Since the class does not use any dependencies (see the class's Javadoc), we use reflection to shutdown logging.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup

#20673\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n`deleteTopicCloseTransactionBufferTest`  will create and then delete 60 topics if `isPartition=true`.\r\n\r\nAnd `checkSnapshotPublisherCount` will execute 3 times with a 5s timeout per time. \r\n\r\nSo it's better to set the `timeOut=15_000` or remove it (fast fail by checkSnapshotPublisherCount timeout).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen topic lookups race(and the first lookup returns too fast before the second request gets deduped), the later lookup requests can timeout because the skipped messages are ignored at the table view and do not notify the service unit state channel.\r\n\r\nex:\r\n\r\nm1: assign to b1 -> m2: owned by b1 -> m3: assign to b2 // m3 is skipped at the tableview\r\n\r\nWhen m3 is skipped, we better get the channel notified to return the lookup request with the current owner(b1) instead of letting the request time out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Added the `handleSkippedMessage` and `setSkippedMsgHandler` in `TopicCompactionStrategy`. \r\n- `ServiceUnitStateChannel` registers `ServiceUnitStateChannel.handleSkippedEvent` to `ServiceUnitStateCompactionStrategy` by `setSkippedMsgHandler`.\r\n- TableView calls `TopicCompactionStrategy.handleSkippedMessage` when messages are skipped.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as ServiceUnitStateChannelImpl.conflictAndCompactionTest\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently NATIVE_AVRO will:\r\n* Convert the Avro schema to string and put it in a SchemaDefinition\r\n* Create a AvroSchema from the SchemaDefinition. \r\n* This will call `createAvroSchema(SchemaDefinition schemaDefinition)` to parse the string into an Avro Schema\r\n* Then the Avro schema is converted again to bytes to be put into a SchemaInfo.\r\n\r\nWe can make this much simpler and efficient by building directly the SchemaInfo from the Avro schema.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nCreate and use a SchemaInfo instead of an AvroSchema.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently you can produce AVRO messages only by passing a binary payload. This is pretty awkward.\r\nIt would be very nice to allow users to encode the AVRO message using JSON when passing the payload from the CLI.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- When you send a message using `bin/pulsar-client produce -m` decode the string using the AVRO JSONDecoder utility and set the result into the payload\r\n- Fix a big in AutoProducesByteSchema#getNativeSchema\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Produce\r\nbin/pulsar-client produce  -vs 'avro:{\"type\":\"record\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\",\"name\": \"FullName\", \"fields\": [{\"name\":\"a\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"b\",\"type\":\"int\" }]}' -s NOSEPARATOR -m '{\"a\":\"b\",\"b\":1}' test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Read\r\nbin/pulsar-client consume -st auto_consume -s sub -p Earliest test \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

: #20617 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, clients' shutdown API does not behave consistently in sense that asynchronicity is not handled explicitly.

Motivation\r\nThe executor in `ManagedLedgerImpl` uses the `MainWorkerPool` of bookKeeper, and both produce and consume use this thread pool.\r\n\r\nWhen there are a large number of partitions in the cluster and the cluster is busy, trim ledger will cause the produce latency to rise from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. We found that a large number of tasks are stuck in the queue of the thread pool\r\n\r\nTrim ledger is a thread-safe operation and has no latency requirements, so we'd better separate it from `MainWorkerPool` of bookKeeper\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nSeparate it from `MainWorkerPool` of bookKeeper\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\nhttps://github.com/315157973/pulsar/pull/9\r\n\r\n###

Motivation\r\n\r\nThis issue has occurred with a topic that has many producers, where the P99 publish latency of the broker will increase to hundreds of milliseconds when many producers connect or disconnect from the topic. This level of latency is unacceptable for a messaging system.\r\n\r\nIn this case, each producer add or remove operation goes to MessageDeduplication to update a map for inactive producers, regardless of whether message deduplication is enabled or disabled. My initial impression is that if message deduplication is disabled, it should not go to MessageDeduplication. However, users can enable message deduplication for an active topic, which may be the reason why this is happening. @merlimat, do you have any additional context on this matter? We may also need to find a solution to avoid any operations to MessageDeduplication if message deduplication is disabled in the future.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a fix without introducing any changes in behavior, which will give us more confidence to cherry-pick it to release branches.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1900\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/12592133/87c22ac2-2af9-4190-a1f2-1872477dd0c4\">\r\n\r\n[broker_lock_0621_1.html.txt](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/files/11863016/broker_lock_0621_1.html.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nUse ConcurrentHashMap instead of synchronized HashMap to reduce the contention between IO threads.\r\n\r\nHere is the benchmark result from [benchmark test](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20648/files)\r\nCLHM_CON (ConcurrentOpenHashMap)\r\nCHM_CON(ConcurrentHashMap)\r\nHM_CON(SynchronizedHashMap)\r\n\r\n```\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-3::put: 422ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-5::put: 422ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-4::put: 422ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-0::put: 423ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-2::put: 422ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-1::put: 423ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-0::get: 786ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-1::get: 805ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-4::get: 839ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-5::get: 840ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-3::get: 854ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-2::get: 855ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-0::remove: 112ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-1::remove: 123ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-4::remove: 97ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-5::remove: 97ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-2::remove: 84ms\r\nCLHM_CON::Thread-3::remove: 85ms\r\nCLHM_CON: 1367 ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-7::put: 33ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-6::put: 35ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-9::put: 37ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-8::put: 38ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-11::put: 38ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-10::put: 39ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-9::get: 630ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-10::get: 629ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-7::get: 635ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-11::get: 630ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-8::get: 631ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-6::get: 635ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-10::remove: 11ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-6::remove: 9ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-7::remove: 11ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-8::remove: 10ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-11::remove: 11ms\r\nCHM_CON::Thread-9::remove: 12ms\r\nCHM_CON: 680 ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-16::put: 643ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-15::put: 664ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-14::put: 670ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-13::put: 674ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-17::put: 687ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-12::put: 715ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-16::get: 61876ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-15::get: 62214ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-13::get: 62312ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-17::get: 62309ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-14::get: 62450ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-16::remove: 638ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-15::remove: 555ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-13::remove: 521ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-17::remove: 522ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-14::remove: 411ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-12::get: 62816ms\r\nHM_CON::Thread-12::remove: 8ms\r\nHM_CON: 63538 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe existing tests can cover the new changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nThe existing behavior logic of the namespaces/topics set offload-policies is inconsistent.\r\n1. The namespaces set-offload-policies does not support configuring the filesystem because the `bucket` options are set as `required`.\r\n2. cli options are different, and the behavior of supporting unit conversion is inconsistent. eg：\r\n\r\n    For example, there are two admin API methods to configure offload policy for `persistent://myprop/clust/ns1/ds1`:\r\n    a. namespaces set-offload-policies in cli commond `set-offload-policies myprop/clust/ns1 -d s3 -r region -b bucket -e \r\n    endpoint -mbs 32M -rbs 5M -oat 10M -oats 100 -oae 10s -orp tiered-storage-first`\r\n\r\n    b. topics set-offload-policies in cli commond `set-offload-policies persistent://myprop/clust/ns1/ds1 -d s3 -r region -b \r\n    bucket -e endpoint -m 33554432 -rb 5242880 -t 10485760 -ts 100 -dl 10000 -orp tiered-storage-first`\r\n\r\n    The command has the same effect, but their command options are different and whether they recognize parameter units \r\n    is also different. **This can easily confuse users**.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n1. Remove unnecessary condition `bucket` `required=true` in namespace#set-offload-policies.\r\n2. Compatible options for namespace/topic and standardized support for unit recognition\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is

Motivation\r\n\r\nThis fixes https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20643.\r\n\r\n### Investigating\r\n\r\n#### Why is the exception `Bookie handle is not available`?\r\n\r\nWe found this problem in the broker's continued to report `Bookie handle is not available` exception longer than 6 hours. The call chain should be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Bk client is trying to [obtain](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/23c83a341f352a59081eef1010c50f19d85292ca/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/proto/PerChannelBookieClientPool.java#L41C9-L41C9) a new channel for connection.  \r\n2. The channel was disconnected, So it is trying to [connect](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/23c83a341f352a59081eef1010c50f19d85292ca/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/proto/PerChannelBookieClient.java#L643) again.\r\n3. Bk Client is trying to [get the bookie](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/23c83a341f352a59081eef1010c50f19d85292ca/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/proto/PerChannelBookieClient.java#L539) info by bookie id.\r\n4. Bk client uses pulsar implemented `PulsarRegistrationClient` to [get bookie info](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/metadata/bookkeeper/PulsarRegistrationClient.java#L224), but the local cache doesn't have it, and then throws the `BKBookieHandleNotAvailableException`\r\n\r\n#### Why did cache lose Bookie's info?\r\n\r\nThe following is an analysis that has yet to be rigorously tested. (Since this will consume a relatively long time)\r\n\r\n1. Check out our [implementation](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/46b6dcd9571262f72f963a755c8a51fb4f66c81e/pulsar-metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/metadata/bookkeeper/PulsarRegistrationClient.java#L174-L192). We will update the local cache async/sync(Depending on the internal metadata cache) and invalidate the local cache synchronously.\r\n2. In Bookie `ZKRegistrationManager`'s [implementation](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/23c83a341f352a59081eef1010c50f19d85292ca/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/discover/ZKRegistrationManager.java#L287-L313), transit bookie mode from writable to read-only should create a read-only bookie node and then delete the writable bookie node.\r\n3. writable -> read-only notification should be as follow:\r\n  - CREATED [read-only path]:bookieId\r\n  - DELETE [writable path]: bookieId\r\n4. Consider that metadata has a cache that invokes the CREATEED notification [logic](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/46b6dcd9571262f72f963a755c8a51fb4f66c81e/pulsar-metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/metadata/bookkeeper/PulsarRegistrationClient.java#L177) synchronously. So, we may create this bookie info first and then delete it. **(bookie info lost here)**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Make the notification process sequentially.\r\n- Support bookie mode in the local cache.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

1.71. When upgrading to 1.75, it is necessary to\r\nexclude the`bc*-jdk15on` dependencies and instead use the `bc*-jdk18on` dependencies. Since many libraries \r\nhave the jdk15on dependency as a transient dependency, it is necessary to handle the exclusions while upgrading.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

messages expired by referring to the `msgRateExpired` value in the subscription stats. However, this value resets to 0 over time, so we instead refer to the `totalMsgExpired` value, which never resets.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we get the stats directly from the instances in the broker server and not from the admin API.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen using KoP protocol, the KoP will `NamespaceService#addNamespaceBundleOwnershipListener` before the broker start, however, at this time, the `ExtensibleLoadManagerImpl` not start yet. So it will cause NPE.\r\n\r\nWe should return an empty set when `ExtensibleLoadManagerImpl` does not start.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Add a check when `getOwnedServiceUnits`.\r\n* Add units test to cover this case.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

The current implementation of the ElasticSearch sink doesn't handle this situation cleanly.  Additionally, the setting of the id of the ElasticSearch document from the Record key is incomplete in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis stems from Slack threads with @cbornet  and @eolivelli \r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nModified the `extractIdAndDocument` method to create a `GenericObject` from the `Record` value if it isn't already. \r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests in ElasticSearchRawRecordTests*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n- When the customer disconnects, the consumer automatically tries to reconnect.\r\n- When a connection is disconnected, the broker will remove the consumer related to this connection.\r\n- The client does not reconnect when it receives a `ConsumerBusyException`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\n| time | `client disconnect` | `broker disconnect` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | disconnect | \r\n| 2 | reconnect |\r\n| 3 | Send `cmd-sub` to the broker | disconnect |\r\n| 4 | Since the old consumer has not been removed in the broker memory, get a consumer busy error |\r\n| 5 | | Remove the old consumer in memory |\r\n| 6 | Stop reconnect |\r\n\r\nAt this time, there is no consumer under this subscription.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**A mechanism to fix the issue above**\r\nOnce a consumer has subscribed successfully, the consumer will try to retry regardless of any exceptions received. see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ConsumerImpl.java#L875\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a test to ensure that the above issue

Motivation\r\n\r\nfix https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20544\r\n\r\nthis problem will cause LoadManager's loadSheding and BundleSplitTask not functioning. because of the lost of real cluster-wide bundle-data in LoadManager.\r\n\r\nmaster code logic in ModularLoadManagerImpl will try to clean up bundle-data if the namespace bundle is splitted.\r\n\r\nbut the current logic will cause amost all bundle-datas in the cluster to be deleted, each time the updateBundleData method triggered.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nmove bundle-data cleanup logic after iterator all broker to get cluster wide activeBundles in updateBundleData method.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nadd unittest to check if the broker number is more than one.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request

#20581\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAfter configuring the geo-replication on Pulsar clusters, the `clusters list` API will return multiple clusters, including the local Pulsar cluster and remote clusters like \r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/pulsar-admin clusters list\r\nus-west\r\nus-east\r\nus-cent\r\n```\r\nBut in this return, you can't distinguish the local and the remote cluster. When you need to remove the geo-replication configuration, it will be hard to decide which cluster should be removed on replicated tenants and namespaces unless you record the cluster information. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\nAdd `--current` option in the cluster list cmd and mark the current cluster with `(*)`\r\n```\r\nbin/pulsar-admin clusters list --current\r\nus-west(*)\r\nus-east\r\nus-cent\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe issue should only happen on the topic with many producers, and the max producer limitation is enabled. When a new producer is added, the broker will check all the existing producers and filter out the remote producer (from the replicator), which will run out of the CPU resource for a short period of time.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1907\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/12592133/14e74ed2-7ace-429b-9352-c643995e0e27\">\r\n\r\n[profiler.html.txt](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/files/11788992/profiler.html.txt)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nA counter will be much more efficient instead of going through all the producers. So a new userCreatedProducerCount is added to the topic.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe existing tests already covered the max producer limitation. The change will not affect the correctness.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn PR https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/14506, we remove the useless config `managedLedgerNumWorkerThreads` \r\n but we didn't remove the config from the config file, if users use this configuration, the Pulsar SQL can't startup due to `strictConfig` mode, remove this useless configuration for Pulsar SQL.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"763\" alt=\"image\"

unused properties\r\nunusedProperties.keySet().removeAll(configurationFactory.getUsedProperties());\r\n\r\nfor (String key : unusedProperties.keySet()) {\r\n    Message message = new

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn `ConnectionHandler`, there is a `Connection` interface whose methods will be called after the connection in `grabCnx` is established, the implementation of `Connection` might send some requests after the connection is established. For example, the consumer will send the `CommandSubscribe` request in `connectionOpened`. However, the whole process is not atomic, which leads to the message lost reported in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20591.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nModify the `Connection#connectionOpened` interface to return a `CompletableFuture`.\r\n\r\nThe returned future should be completed once the implementation has done everything, e.g. for the consumer, the future should only be completed after receiving the response for `CommandSubscribe`.\r\n\r\nIn `grabCnx`, the `ConnectionHandler` could only connect to the broker once the whole process is completed.\r\n\r\nAdd `ConnectionHandlerTest` to verify the behavior.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#20581\r\nPIP: #20614\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAfter configuring the geo-replication on Pulsar clusters, the `clusters list` API will return multiple clusters, including the local Pulsar cluster and remote clusters like \r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/pulsar-admin clusters list\r\nus-west\r\nus-east\r\nus-cent\r\n```\r\nBut in this return, you can't distinguish the local and the remote cluster. When you need to remove the geo-replication configuration, it will be hard to decide which cluster should be removed on replicated tenants and namespaces unless you record the cluster information. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\nAdd `local` flag to distinguish clusters\r\n```\r\nbin/pulsar-admin clusters list\r\nus-west(local)\r\nus-east\r\nus-cent\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background of consumer reconnects**\r\n- grab connection: \r\n  - lookup the broker which owned the topic\r\n  - get the existing connection by the broker; create one if it does not exist\r\n- clear the messages in memory\r\n- send `CMD-subscribe` to the broker\r\n- send `flow permits` to broker to increment `availablePermits`\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Issue**\r\n\r\nIf the consumer tries to reconnect<sup>[1]</sup> multi times, it will lose some messages due to a race condition, for example:\r\n\r\n| time | reconnect-1 | reconnect-2 |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Grab connection | \r\n| 2 | | Grab connection |\r\n| 3 | Clear messages in memory |\r\n| 4 | Do subscribe and increase `availablePermits` |\r\n| 5 | receive 712 messages |\r\n| 6 | | Clear messages in memory. <strong>(Highlight)</strong> 712 messages were lost |\r\n| 7 | Do subscribe and increase `availablePermits`(Since a subscription is there, so broker just response success) |\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see that the variable `availablePermits` of all the stuck consumers is large than `1000`(by default, the max value is `1000`), and `${availablePermits} + ${msgOutCounter}` is an integer multiple of `1000`. It means the broker received more than one `CMD-flow` of the same consumer<sup>[2]</sup>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Why does reconnection execute more than once**: there are these scenarios that could trigger reconnection:\r\n\r\n- Broker sends commands `cmd-close_consumer`, such as `unload topic`, `reset clusters`, and so on. \r\n- The connection was forcibly closed, such as the Broker disconnected or some things wrong with the network.\r\n- Netty handler receives some exception(no matter what type ex)\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ClientCnx.java#L355\r\n- The customer actively reconnects if failed subscription.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nDiscard the task `subscribe` if there is an in-flight subscribe\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#20576\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere is a case resulted in duplicated consumer, if we add the same consumer twice continuously, then close consumer, the offline consumer would remain in consumerList, because AbstractDispatcherMultipleConsumers#consumerList is arrayList and AbstractDispatcherMultipleConsumers#consumerSet is set.\r\n\r\nThere is a concurrent problem in ServerCnx#handleSubscribe,  which cause this case. Suppose client request handleSubscribe() three times and request handleCloseConsumer(). The execute order is as follow. since the order is addConsumer->addConsumer->close, but not addConsumer->close->addConsumer, duplicated consumer problem occur.\r\n\r\n![企业微信截图_1ea4ed11-3c2b-4e46-94a8-aad1be312b93](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/13505225/5a8de281-03fe-4157-84aa-46ad08555823)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. remove the step 9 \"consumersLongHashmap.remove consumerFuture3\". \r\n\r\n- Because if judge existingConsumerFuture is not null, it means there is an earlier request try to handleSubscribe. the remove operation should be executed in the earlier request. \r\n\r\n2. add a test to verify this concurrent problem and the fix \r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*.

That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #xyz \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWe introduced DirectIO since BookKeeper 4.16.0, and the DirectIO classes use KV-based Slf4jSlogger. https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-slogger/slf4j/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/slogger/slf4j/Slf4jSlogger.java \r\n\r\nIn order to print the KV out, we need to add `%X` flag in log4j2.yaml, otherwise the log will miss the detailed key and values.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd `%X` for log4j2.yaml Appender PatternLayout. \r\n\r\nOne Behavior change is that the command log will contain `{}` string if the key value is empty.\r\nFor example, between `org.apache.bookkeeper.replication.Auditor` and ` - I'm starting as Auditor Bookie. ID: 10.25.14.105:3181`, it contains and extra `{}`\r\n```\r\n2023-06-14T16:36:32,563+0800 [AuditorElector-10.25.14.105:3181] INFO  org.apache.bookkeeper.replication.Auditor {} - I'm starting as Auditor Bookie.

Motivation\r\nDuring the recovery process, if the system topic `__transaction_buffer_snapshot` is not located on the same broker as the common topic, it can cause issues and result in a `ServiceUnitNotReadyException`, leading to recovery failure. The current approach of using `topic.getBrokerService().getTopic()` to check the existence of the system topic can trigger errors during the `checkTopicNsOwnership` step. \r\n## Modification\r\nTo avoid potential recovery failures and ensure a reliable check for topic existence, we should use the `pulsarResource` feature. By utilizing `pulsarResource`, we can list the persistent topics in the namespace and verify whether the system topic exists on any broker. This approach provides a more robust solution, preventing the occurrence of `ServiceUnitNotReadyException` and ensuring successful recovery in scenarios where the system topic is not located on the same broker as the common topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/14941\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n### Issue-1(this PR fixes)\r\nWhen a topic load fails due to `timeout ex`, Broker will not clean up the exception future, causing other APIs to fail when they touch this future. You can reproduce it by `testUnloadNamespaceAfterLoadTopicFailed`\r\n\r\n### Issue-2\r\nIf the program is executed as the flow below, there will still be one orphan topic that is not closed.\r\n\r\n| time | `create topic` | `timeout check` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Start to create a topic |\r\n| 2 | Open managed ledger, and do recover for every cursor |\r\n| 3 | | Time out and remove the topic from the cache |\r\n| 4 | An orphan topic still is there |\r\n\r\nI will try to reproduce this scenario later(not in this PR)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contexts\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-12T06:55:17,479+0000
