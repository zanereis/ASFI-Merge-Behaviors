per the discussion with @ijuma and @mumrah, the `share` module seems not required and it's advised to user `server` and `server-common` instead. The PR moves the classes from `share` module to respective server related modules.\r\n\r\nFollowing has been refactored in the PR:\r\n\r\n- Moved Share Fetch, Acknowledge, Session, Context and Cache related classes to `server` module as the classes are used by `core` and `tools` modules.\r\n- Moved `Persister` releated classes from `share` to `server-common` as the Persister classes though currently just being used by `core` module but in [near future](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/17775) will also be used by `group-coordinator`. Hence the Persister classes shouldn't go in `server`. The debate is mostly between `coordinator-common` vs `server-common`. We have kept the Persister in `server-common` for now, the classes are more related to the server than the coordinator. Persister is basically an abstraction in the server to let you choose how you want to persist the share group progress.\r\n- Updated build.gradle to remove `share` module.\r\n- Removed `import-control-share.xml`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-14T12:35:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:07:58Z","closed_at":"2025-01-16T08:14:25Z","merged_at":"2025-01-16T08:14:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1f74573895734110f309755f0a75b95046f0704","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"AndrewJSchofield","id":13795597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzk1NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13795597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewJSchofield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

necessarily receive _all_ the partitions it's assigned in a single call to `onPartitionsAssigned()` (same with `onPartitionsRevoked()`). The test assumed that because it received _a_ call to `onPartitionsAssigned()` that means that call included _both_ partitions.

related to KAFKA-18298 and KAFKA-18297.\r\n\r\nTo prevent members from rejoining after being removed, close consumers in ConsumerThread before removing group members. The members deletion flow has been changed to below:\r\n1. Before consumers closed: 2 static, 1 dynamic member  in group\r\n2. After consumers closed: 2 static member in group\r\n3. After remove 1 static member:1  static member in group\r\n4. After remove remain member in group: group is empty\r\n\r\nThe reason of rewritting the deletion flow:\r\n1. Closed consumers can ensure no member rejoin during member deletion.\r\n2.

4.0 will remove support for zk mode and will require conversion to kraft before upgrading to 4.0. The minimum kraft version is 3.0 (aka 3.0-IV1).\r\n\r\nThis provides an opportunity to remove exclusively server side protocols versions that only exist to allow direct upgrades from versions older than 3.0 or that are used only by zk mode.\r\n\r\nSince KRaft became production ready in 3.3, we should consider setting the baseline to 3.3. But that requires more discussion and it can be done via a separate change (KAFKA-18601).\r\n\r\nProtocol changes:\r\n* Remove RequestHeader v0 (only used by ControlledShutdown v0)\r\n* Remove WriteTxnMarkers v0\r\n* Remove all versions of ControlledShutdown, LeaderAndIsr, StopReplica, UpdateMetadata\r\n\r\nIn order to remove all versions safely, extend generator to support setting \"versions\" to \"none\".\r\nIn this case, we no longer generate the `*Data` classes, but we still reserve the id for\r\nthe relevant protocol api (so it doesn't get accidentally used for something else). The protocol\r\ndocumentation is correct after these changes.\r\n\r\nWe kept a simplified version of `LeaderAndIsr{Request|Response}` because it's used by many\r\ntests that are still relevant in kraft mode. Once KAFKA-18486 is done, it may be possible to remove\r\nit (I left a comment on the ticket). Similarly, KAFKA-18487 may make it possible to remove\r\nthe introduced `StopReplicaPartitionState` (left a comment on that ticket too).\r\n\r\nThere are a number of places that were adjusted to include an `ApiKeys.hasValidVersion`\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-12T21:13:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T16:32:44Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T21:51:44Z","merged_at":"2025-01-20T21:51:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"87b37a4065f7e3caf82712b406fe794f2fae8b4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

`k.util.Log4jController` to `LoggingController`.\r\n- Removes `o.a.l.l.Level` from the signature of public methods of `o.a.k.connect.runtime.Loggers` and replaces it with `String`.\r\n- Provides an additional no-op implementation of `k.util.LoggingController` and `o.a.k.connect.runtime.Loggers`: if Log4j Core is not present on the runtime classpath the no-op implementation will be used.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-18266\r\n\r\nWith this change, I have re-ordered the validations when validating the sanity of TimeIndex such that the expensive ones are performed at the end. \r\n\r\nE.g.  A read from mmap is more expensive compared to the others. In best case scenarios, mmap is completely mapped to memory and hence, the lookup is cheap but in worst case scenario, OS will load the data we want to read from mmap on-demand. \r\n\r\nHence, it is moved to the last.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-10T16:42:37Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T15:26:01Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T15:26:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d445a752d7e68c1ba3ae3fe814d56bd77d04f5f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5610263660,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTmXUbA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/storage","name":"storage","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Pull

the current assignment builder, analogous to the current assignment builder of consumer groups. The main difference is the underlying assigned resource, and slightly different logic around process IDs: We make sure to move a task only to a new client, once the task is not owned anymore by any client with the same process ID (sharing the same state directory) - in any role (active, standby or warm-up).\r\n\r\nCompared to the feature branch, the main difference is that I refactored the separate treatment of active, standby and warm-up tasks into a compound datatype called `TaskTuple` (which is used in place of the more specific `Assignment` class). This also has effects on `StreamsGroupMember`. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

avoid self-fencing in the commit/abort + empty abort scenario, return the concurrent transactions error when we have pending state and do the epoch check second.

This is because we don’t return from EndTxn (the first commit) until we already written to the log, transitioned to PrepareX, and have the pending CompleteX state. We don't need to worry about the cases of an EndTxn request coming in with PrepareX without the pending state because that would be an older request and/or retry which are already

KAFKA-17171\r\n\r\n> The patch should include following test cases.\r\n>1. a topic-related static config is added to quorum controller. The configs from topic creation should include it, but `describeConfigs` does not.\r\n>2. a topic-related static config is added to quorum controller. The configs from topic creation should include it, and `describeConfigs` does if admin is using controller.bootstrap\r\n>3. a topic-related static config is added to broker. The configs from topic creation should NOT include it, but `describeConfigs` does.\r\n>4. a topic-related static config is added to broker. The configs from topic creation should NOT include it, and `describeConfigs` does not also if admin is using controller.bootstrap\r\n>for another, the docs of `STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG` should remind the impact of \"controller.properties\"\r\n>BTW, those test cases should leverage new test infra, since new test infra allow us to define configs to broker/controller individually.\r\n\r\n### Committer

PR implements a way to divide acquired batches into batch size as desirable by client.\r\n\r\nThe BatchSize is the soft limit and should allign the batches in response and cached state in broker at the log batch boundaries i.e. \r\n```\r\nsay produce log batch is from 0-50, 51-100\r\n\r\nfor batch size from client - 60: then response will be 0-100\r\nfor batch size from client - 40: then response will be 0-50, 51-100\r\n```\r\nThis means that broker will not break the batches rather align them in response as per desirable batch size from client so complete batches are acknowledged which shall avoid offset based tracking on broker.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Apache ZooKeeper from the Apache Kafka build. Also remove commons IO, commons CLI, and netty, which were dependencies we took only because of ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the size of this PR manageable, I did not remove all classes which formerly interfaced with ZK. I just removed the ZK types. Fortunately, Kafka generally wrapped ZK data structures rather than using them directly.\r\n\r\nSome classes were pretty entangled with ZK, so it was easier just to stub them out. For ZkNodeChangeNotificationListener.scala, PartitionStateMachine.scala, ReplicaStateMachine.scala, KafkaZkClient.scala, and ZookeeperClient.scala, I replaced all the functions with \"throw new UnsupportedOperationException\". Since the tests for these classes have been removed, as well as the ZK-based broker code, this should be OK as an incremental step.","created_at":"2025-01-08T21:21:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T14:31:52Z","closed_at":"2025-01-09T02:25:18Z","merged_at":"2025-01-09T02:25:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"c28d9a348670f9efc599b481366da0af813aa8ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka
