we are now building ARM images in parallel, We need more powerful\r\nmachines and we implemented in-memory docker, similarly as in our AMD\r\ninstances. The m6g.2xlarge  are quite a bit better than c6g.xlarge for\r\nour case:\r\n\r\n1) They have 8 vCPUs\r\n2) They have 32 GB memory (should be enough to build 4 ARM CI images\r\n3) Thye are Memory-optimised, and since docker is build in memory\r\n   the memory speed is the most important factor\r\n\r\nThis also allows to switch building all images (including cache)\r\nin parallel - so that we can have 1 job instead of 4 - similarly\r\nas we have in case of regular AMD builds.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of it is that we loose far less time of the\r\nAMD instance which \"triggers\" the docker build, because this instance\r\nwill control 4 parallel builds at a time effectively, which will\r\ndecrease a lot of overhead connected with running the instance mostly\r\nidle during the build (and since the builds will be generally\r\nfaster, the overhead will be even smaller).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` implementation from attrs interacts badly with Airflow's DAG serialization and pickling. When a mapped task is deserialized, subclasses are coerced to MappedOperator. But when the instances go through DAG pickling, all attributes defined in the subclasses are dropped by attrs's custom state management.\r\n\r\nSince attrs does not do anything too special here (the logic is only important for `slots=True`), we can use Python's built-in implementation instead.\r\n\r\nI locally ran `airflow scheduler` and this seems to fix the exceptions, but it seems difficult to create a meaningful test for this due to all the components involved. Ideas on test setup are much welcomed.\r\n\r\nFix

#23949\r\nrelated: #22900\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of the auto-refresh feature on the dags page. Auto-refresh currently targeted _all_ dags. This PR modifies the behavior to only targets _active_ (ie. unpaused) dags.\r\n\r\nA few important notes:\r\n* Clicking the refresh button (the circular arrow icon) at the top right of the page still refreshes _all_ dags.\r\n* If there are no active dags, and the \"auto-refresh\" switch is enabled, no request is sent and the switch _stays enabled_.\r\n\r\nThis behavior makes the most sense to me, but I have no problem changing it if requested.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11639738/176803378-b42d2bf7-6a4f-4cf1-b592-2107d105c479.mp4\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-01T01:26:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T19:55:20Z","closed_at":"2022-07-13T14:55:58Z","merged_at":"2022-07-13T14:55:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a1472a6bef57fc57cfe4577bcbed5ba00521409","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Improvements"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

recent changes in selective checks introduced a few problems\r\nin non-main branches:\r\n\r\n* constraints branch was not used by CI build in non-main branch\r\n  this was not a proble, (until it started to fail) because\r\n  other branches always work in \"upgradeDepencies\" case\r\n\r\n* default branch calculation did not account for the selective-check\r\n  that was run before default branch was retrieved. Therefore\r\n  we did not run build as from 2.3 branch. Now the branch is retrieved\r\n  before selective checks are run.\r\n\r\n* Some precomits should be skiped in non-main branch\r\n\r\n* Integration was also excluded additionally to Providers tests as\r\n  integration tests are not at all useful for non-main branch\r\n\r\n* Two more outputs added for selective checks:\r\n  * docs-filter -  allows to filer which documentation should be built\r\n  * skip-pre-commit - allows to dynamically choose which pre-commits\r\n    should be skipped\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

all! This is related to #23129. In BigQuery, fully qualified dataset names can be made using the GCP project ID even if the project ID isn't needed for the underlying API to work. It's not unusual to make `project_id` a default arg and to have it be templated, especially if you're using many BQ operators together. I've added it to two operators where I have used it to construct a dataset name. \r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure how we test templated fields - I looked at the BQ operator test and didn't see any kind of validation, and the test values we're passing to the mocked calls are not templated. Any recommendations for how to handle that are appreciated!","created_at":"2022-06-30T20:09:13Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T14:06:22Z","closed_at":"2022-07-13T20:46:45Z","merged_at":"2022-07-13T20:46:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"77626b7fc8ad57e71b3e93f81429424bdfa002a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

part of #24699 (the other would be to fix the web UI). This adds the ability to clear one specific mapped task’s state via the REST API.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit more complicated than I’d desired. Currently the `clearTaskInstance` endpoint accepts a `task_ids` field that takes a list of strings to filter out specific tasks. To make this support map indexes, I first tried the followings:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    \"task_ids\": [\r\n        \"task_1\",  // Clearing the entire task, multiple tis if mapped.\r\n        [\"task_2\", 1],  // Clearing one specific ti.\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not work since it requires using the new `prefixItems` key to specify an array as tuple, which was added in Open API 3.1, but we’re still on 3.0.\r\n\r\nNext I tried\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    \"task_ids\": [\r\n        \"task_1\",\r\n        {\"task_id\": \"task_2\", \"map_index\": 1},\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don’t like duplicating `task_id` inside the nested object, but even this does not work, since Open API 3.0 also forbids heterogeneous arrays.\r\n\r\nSo in the end I added a new field `tasks`, that only accepts the object form, and merge `task_ids` and `tasks` in the backend instead. In the future, once we are able to use heterogeneous arrays, we could merge the two fields back into one property to clean up the interface. For now though, this is what we need to do.\r\n\r\nExample request now:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    ...,\r\n    \"task_ids\": [\"task_1\", ...],\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\"task_id\": \"task_2\", \"map_index\": 1},\r\n        {\"task_id\": \"task_3\"},  // Allowed; same as adding task_3 to task_ids.\r\n        ...,\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2022-06-29T12:00:25Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T00:14:19Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T00:14:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6181b7eac62c0cb66af576c6113593c734ffa5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

more\r\nmerge-friendly - i.e. if two PRs will work on two different commands\r\nthe rebase should result with merge rather than conflict.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

had 2 issues with grid scrolling for large DAGs:\r\n\r\n1. Grid actions (expand groups, close details panel, auto refresh) would get cut off or overlap with the grid\r\n2.

``setup.py`` had ALWAUS contained provider dependencies,\r\nbut this is really a remnant of Airlfow 1.10 where providers\r\nwere not separated out to subfolders of \"providers\".\r\n\r\nThis change moves all the provider-specific dependencies\r\nto provider.yaml where they are kept together with all other\r\nprovider meta-data.\r\n\r\nLater, when we move providers out, we can move them to\r\nprovider specific setup.py files (or let provider-specific\r\nsetup.py files read them from provider.yaml) but this is\r\nnot something we want to do it now.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies.json is now renamed to provider_dependencies.json\r\nand moved to \"airflow\" so tha it can be kept as part of the\r\nsources needed for sdist package to provide extras. Pre-commit still\r\ngenerates the file as needed and it contains now both:\r\n\r\n* cross-provider-deps information which providers depend on each\r\n  other\r\n* deps - information what regular dependencies are needed for each\r\n  provider\r\n\r\nOn top of preparing to splitting providers it has the advantage,\r\nthat there will be no more case where adding a dependency change\r\nfor provider will not run tests for that provider.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

``setup.py`` had ALWAUS contained provider dependencies,\r\nbut this is really a remnant of Airlfow 1.10 where providers\r\nwere not separated out to subfolders of \"providers\".\r\n\r\nThis change moves all the provider-specific dependencies\r\nto provider.yaml where they are kept together with all other\r\nprovider meta-data.\r\n\r\nLater, when we move providers out, we can move them to\r\nprovider specific setup.py files (or let provider-specific\r\nsetup.py files read them from provider.yaml) but this is\r\nnot something we want to do it now.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies.json is now renamed to provider_dependencies.json\r\nand moved to \"airflow\" so tha it can be kept as part of the\r\nsources needed for sdist package to provide extras. Pre-commit still\r\ngenerates the file as needed and it contains now both:\r\n\r\n* cross-provider-deps information which providers depend on each\r\n  other\r\n* deps - information what regular dependencies are needed for each\r\n  provider\r\n\r\nOn top of preparing to splitting providers it has the advantage,\r\nthat there will be no more case where adding a dependency change\r\nfor provider will not run tests for that provider.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Add missing extra parameters in docs\r\n* Add links to specific boto3, botocore, AWS, etc. documentations\r\n* Fix some links in code\r\n* Mark as deprecated (both in docs and Hook it self): `aws_account_id`, `aws_iam_role`, `external_id`, `s3_config_file`, `s3_config_format`, `profile`\r\n\r\nGood candidate for future deprecation:\r\n1. ~`s3_config_file`, `s3_config_format`, `profile`~\r\n~This options migrated from legacy S3Hook https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/3865836563e0ce97fd57232f4b6ede2fff601595 in Airflow 1.9, and never been documented and well-tested. This use for parse local credentials file in selected formats:~\r\n   + ~boto config files - boto not maintained for many years~\r\n   + ~AWS Shared Credentials file. In current implementation only get parts credentials. If need to specify non default location to AWS Shared Credentials and AWS Config files better to use configuration of botocore.sessionSession. In this case also could use additional abilities such as [credential_process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html), and profiles inheritance.~\r\n   + ~s3cmd - Seems like this utility never been part of Airflow~\r\n2. `host` might confuse users (actually couple of issues exists in Github) better rename to `endpoint_url`\r\n3. `session_kwargs` - only

implementing #24610 and few follow-up fixes, it is now easy\r\nto add more optimizations to our unit test execution in CI (and\r\nto give this capability back to our contributors).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds capability of running tests for selected set of\r\nproviders - not for the whole \"Providers\" group. You can\r\nspecify `--test-type \"Providers[airbyte,http]\" to only run tests\r\nfor the two selected providers.\r\n\r\nThis is the step towards separating providers to separate\r\nrepositories, but it also allows to optimize the experience of\r\nthe contributors developing only single provider changes (which\r\nis vast majority of contributions).\r\n\r\nThis also allows to optimize build and elapsed time needd to run\r\ntests for those PRs that only affects selected providers (again -\r\nvast majority of PRs).\r\n\r\nThe CI selection of which provider tests is done now in Selective\r\nCheckcs - they are a bit smarter in just selecting the providers\r\nthat has been changed, they also check if there are any other\r\nproviders that depend on it (we keep automatically updated by\r\npre-commit dependencies.json file and this file determines\r\nwhich files should be run.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

behaviour of Breeze after some recent changes related to\r\npulling and building images in parallel have been slightly broken.\r\nNothing serious but slightly annoying behaviour:\r\n\r\n* when starting breeze shell, the image was attempted to be\r\n  build even if it was not needed (but cache efficiency made it fast\r\n  enough to not be too annoying (unless we updated to newer\r\n  python base image\r\n\r\n* breeze pull command for \"latest\" branch makes no sense any more -\r\n  we stopped pushing \"latest\" image to ghcr.io, we only push\r\n  cache and \"tagged\" images. We are now turning --image-tag as\r\n  required in \"pull_image\" and when someone specifies latest,\r\n  error and helpful message is printed\r\n\r\n* --force-build flag in \"shell-related-commands\" was not\r\n  properly propagated to build-image so it did not actually\r\n  force image building.\r\n\r\nAll those problems are fixed now.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
