(but not limited to) literal sequences, were CPD would\nreport duplicate overlapping or partially overlapping matches. These have now been fixed, and CPD will report\nonly the longest non-overlapping duplicate.</p>\n<p>These improvements apply to all supported languages, irrespective of supported flags.</p>\n<h4>✨ New Rules</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unnecessaryvarargsarraycreation\"><code>UnnecessaryVarargsArrayCreation</code></a> reports explicit array creation\nwhen a varargs is expected. This is more heavy to read and could be simplified.</li>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#confusingargumenttovarargsmethod\"><code>ConfusingArgumentToVarargsMethod</code></a> reports some confusing situations\nwhere a varargs method is called with an inexact argument type. These may end up in a mismatch between the expected\nparameter type and the actual value.</li>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#lambdacanbemethodreference\"><code>LambdaCanBeMethodReference</code></a> reports lambda expressions that can be replaced\nwith a method reference. Please read the documentation of the rule for more info. This rule is now part of the Quickstart\nruleset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>🌟 Rule Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junittestsshouldincludeassert\"><code>JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junittestcontainstoomanyasserts\"><code>JUnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts</code></a>\nhave a new property named <code>extraAssertMethodNames</code>. With this property, you can configure which additional static\nmethods should be considered as valid verification methods. This allows to use custom mocking or assertion libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🐛 Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/494\">#494</a>: [core] Adopt JApiCmp to enforce control over API changes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4942\">#4942</a>: [core] CPD: <code>--skip-duplicate-files</code> has no effect (7.0.0 regression)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4959\">#4959</a>: [core] Upgrade saxon to 12.4</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>cli</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/HEAD/#stats\">📈 Stats</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🚀 New and noteworthy</h3>\n<h4>More robust CPD reports</h4>\n<p>There were a number of circumstances, specially around (but not limited to) literal sequences, were CPD would\nreport duplicate overlapping or partially overlapping matches. These have now been fixed, and CPD will report\nonly the longest non-overlapping duplicate.</p>\n<p>These improvements apply to all supported languages, irrespective of supported flags.</p>\n<h4>✨ New Rules</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#unnecessaryvarargsarraycreation\"><code>UnnecessaryVarargsArrayCreation</code></a> reports explicit array creation\nwhen a varargs is expected. This is more heavy to read and could be simplified.</li>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_errorprone.html#confusingargumenttovarargsmethod\"><code>ConfusingArgumentToVarargsMethod</code></a> reports some confusing situations\nwhere a varargs method is called with an inexact argument type. These may end up in a mismatch between the expected\nparameter type and the actual value.</li>\n<li>The new Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#lambdacanbemethodreference\"><code>LambdaCanBeMethodReference</code></a> reports lambda expressions that can be replaced\nwith a method reference. Please read the documentation of the rule for more info. This rule is now part of the Quickstart\nruleset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>🌟 Rule Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junittestsshouldincludeassert\"><code>JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.1.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junittestcontainstoomanyasserts\"><code>JUnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts</code></a>\nhave a new property named <code>extraAssertMethodNames</code>.

`cxf.zipkin-reporter.version` from 2.17.2 to 3.4.0.\nUpdates `io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave` from 2.17.2 to 3.4.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.4 deprecates <code>AsyncReporter/SpanHandler</code> <code>queuedMaxBytes</code> and disables it by default.</p>\n<p>When introduced, <code>AsyncReporter</code> had three ways to trigger a queue flush:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queuedMaxSpans</code> - when the number of spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> - when the size of the spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>messageTimeout</code> - when a span has been in the queue longer than a threshold</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> was deprecated because requires time in the critical path, to calculate the size of a span to make sure it doesn't breach the threshold. This is problematic in tools that check for pinning, like Virtual Threads.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> for sorting this out!</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.3.0..3.4.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.3.0..3.4.0</a></p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.3 adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/BaseHttpSender.java\"><code>BaseHttpSender</code></a> type, which eases http library integration. It also adds <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/HttpEndpointSupplier.java\"><code>HttpEndpointSupplier</code></a> which supports dynamic endpoint discovery such as from <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/eureka\">Eureka</a>, as well utilities to create constants or rate-limit suppliers. Finally, brave users get a native PROTO3 encoder through the new <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/brave/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/brave/MutableSpanBytesEncoder.java\"><code>MutableSpanBytesEncoder</code></a> type.</p>\n<p>These features were made in support of spring-boot, but available to any user with no new dependencies. For example, the PROTO encoder adds no library dependency, even if it increases the size of <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java?tab=readme-ov-file#brave\">zipkin-reporter-brave </a> by a couple dozen KB. A lion's share of thanks goes to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> who were on design and review duty for several days leading to this.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of pulling most of these things together, integrating a sender with <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java?tab=readme-ov-file#brave\">spring-cloud-loadbalancer</a> (a client-side loadbalancer library).</p>\n<p>This endpoint supplier will get the configuration endpoint value and look up the next target to use with the <code>loadBalancerClient</code>. The rate limiter will ensure a gap of 30 seconds between queries. While below is hard-coded, it covers some routine advanced features formerly only available in <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth\">spring-cloud-sleuth</a>.

This is problematic in tools that check for pinning, like Virtual Threads.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> for sorting this out!</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.3.0..3.4.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.3.0..3.4.0</a></p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.3 adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/BaseHttpSender.java\"><code>BaseHttpSender</code></a> type, which eases http library integration. It also adds <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/HttpEndpointSupplier.java\"><code>HttpEndpointSupplier</code></a> which supports dynamic endpoint discovery such as from <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/eureka\">Eureka</a>, as well utilities to create constants or rate-limit suppliers. Finally, brave users get a native PROTO3 encoder through the new <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/brave/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/brave/MutableSpanBytesEncoder.java\"><code>MutableSpanBytesEncoder</code></a> type.</p>\n<p>These features were made in support of spring-boot, but available to any user with no new dependencies. For example, the PROTO encoder adds no library dependency, even if it increases the size of <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java?tab=readme-ov-file#brave\">zipkin-reporter-brave </a> by a couple dozen KB. A lion's share of thanks goes to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> who were on design and review duty for several days leading to this.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of pulling most of these things together, integrating a sender with <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java?tab=readme-ov-file#brave\">spring-cloud-loadbalancer</a> (a client-side loadbalancer library).</p>\n<p>This endpoint supplier will get the configuration endpoint value and look up the next target to use with the <code>loadBalancerClient</code>. The rate limiter will ensure a gap of 30 seconds between queries. While below is hard-coded, it covers some routine advanced features formerly only available in <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth\">spring-cloud-sleuth</a>.

all,\r\n\r\nI am currently checking the integration of CXF 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT into TomEE 10 and I noticed a change in `AbstractHTTPDestination`.\r\n\r\nAn additional `try-catch` was added around `getUserPrincipal()` catching any kind of `Exception` and just returning `null`. \r\n\r\nWas this intentional (or required by the spec)? I think, that we shouldn't catch everything here.\r\n\r\nI noticed this change by debugging TomEE's Microprofile JWT integration and one specific TCK test was failing:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.tck.container.jaxrs.EmptyTokenTest#invalidToken\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe provided token is invalid, we cannot parse a principal out of it and since it is in an invalid format anyway, our impl will throw an exception.\r\nThis exception is now caught and mapped to `null`, which is quite bad (as it will just return http 200 instead of 401).

Tons of thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/frosiere\"><code>@​frosiere</code></a> for the help on this! We also changed how dependencies are managed so that less false-positives show up due to our backwards compatability testing. We appreciate your continued use and feedback!</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/6.0.1..6.0.2\">https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/6.0.1..6.0.2</a></p>\n<p>Brave 6.0.1 simplifies internals of the json encoder and kafka-streams instrumentation. It also fixes a bug where a <code>Tag&lt;Throwable&gt;</code> passed to <code>MutableSpanBytesEncoder.zipkinJsonV2</code> always used the key &quot;error&quot; even when set to something else. Finally <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> fixed a flakey JMS integration test which was plaguing our CI builds!</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/6.0.0..6.0.1\">https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/6.0.0..6.0.1</a></p>\n<p>Brave 6 removes all modules and functions deprecated in Brave 5.x. It no longer has any dependency on io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> for a lot of review support leading to this release!</p>\n<h2>No more deprecated functions</h2>\n<p>The final release of Brave 5 with deprecated functions was 5.18.1. Removing these functions was the only way to decouple Brave from zipkin's core library (io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin). However, this does not change Brave's floor Java 6 support. We still integration test this via the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave-example\">brave-example</a> repository.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a working Java 6 and Spring 2.5 application, which is 280KB smaller due to use of the lean combination of Brave 6 and Zipkin Reporter 3.x:</p>\n<pre><code># brave 5.18.1\n3860    target/brave-example-webmvc25-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war\n# brave 6.0.0\n3580    target/brave-example-webmvc25-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war\n</code></pre>\n<h2>No more io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter or io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin dependencies</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.brave/brave-bom\">io.zipkin.brave:brave-bom</a> used to manage zipkin-reporter dependencies. Since Brave no longer has dependencies on zipkin, it no longer manages them.</p>\n<p>This impact is that users will need to manage their own versions for zipkin-reporter, likely via <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-bom\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom</a> described in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#library-releases\">zipkin-reporter README</a>.</p>\n<p>To fully remove a zipkin core library dependency from your traced applications, use <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases/tag/3.1.1\">3.x</a> <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code>. This is described in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#library-releases\">zipkin-reporter README</a>. You can expect currently maintained frameworks to do this on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your patience with the major upgrade. Things like this allow easier maintenance and a longer life for Brave, particularly as zipkin-server moves ahead with later Java versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/5.17.1..5.18.1\">https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/5.17.1..5.18.1</a></p>\n<p>Brave 5.18 prepares for Brave 6 by deprecating instrumentation for libraries not released in 1.5-3.5 years including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>context/rxjava2 - last released Feb 2021\n<ul>\n<li>replaced by RxJava3, but unlikely this module will be ported as it wasn't used widely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>instrumentation/dubbo-rpc - (alibaba) last released Dec 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java) from 2.17.1 to 3.4.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.4 deprecates <code>AsyncReporter/SpanHandler</code> <code>queuedMaxBytes</code> and disables it by default.</p>\n<p>When introduced, <code>AsyncReporter</code> had three ways to trigger a queue flush:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queuedMaxSpans</code> - when the number of spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> - when the size of the spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>messageTimeout</code> - when a span has been in the queue longer than a threshold</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> was deprecated because requires time in the critical path, to calculate the size of a span to make sure it doesn't breach the threshold. This is problematic in tools that check for pinning, like Virtual Threads.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> for sorting this out!</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.3.0..3.4.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.3.0..3.4.0</a></p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.3 adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/BaseHttpSender.java\"><code>BaseHttpSender</code></a> type, which eases http library integration. It also adds <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/HttpEndpointSupplier.java\"><code>HttpEndpointSupplier</code></a> which supports dynamic endpoint discovery such as from <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/eureka\">Eureka</a>, as well utilities to create constants or rate-limit suppliers. Finally, brave users get a native PROTO3 encoder through the new <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/brave/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/brave/MutableSpanBytesEncoder.java\"><code>MutableSpanBytesEncoder</code></a> type.</p>\n<p>These features were made in support of spring-boot, but available to any user with no new dependencies. For example, the PROTO encoder adds no library dependency, even if it increases the size of <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java?tab=readme-ov-file#brave\">zipkin-reporter-brave </a> by a couple dozen KB. A lion's share of thanks goes to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> who were on design and review duty for several days leading to this.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of pulling most of these things together, integrating a sender with <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java?tab=readme-ov-file#brave\">spring-cloud-loadbalancer</a> (a client-side loadbalancer library).</p>\n<p>This endpoint supplier will get the configuration endpoint value and look up the next target to use with the <code>loadBalancerClient</code>. The rate limiter will ensure a gap of 30 seconds between queries. While below is hard-coded, it covers some routine advanced features formerly only available in <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth\">spring-cloud-sleuth</a>. Now, anyone can use them!</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)\npublic class ZipkinDiscoveryConfiguration {\n  @Bean HttpEndpointSupplier.Factory loadbalancerEndpoints(LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient) {\n    LoadBalancerHttpEndpointSupplier.Factory httpEndpointSupplierFactory =\n        new LoadBalancerHttpEndpointSupplier.Factory(loadBalancerClient);\n    // don't ask more than 30 seconds (just to show)\n    return HttpEndpointSuppliers.newRateLimitedFactory(httpEndpointSupplierFactory, 30);\n  }\n<p>record LoadBalancerHttpEndpointSupplier(LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient, URI virtualURL)\nimplements HttpEndpointSupplier {\nrecord Factory(LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient) implements HttpEndpointSupplier.Factory {</p>\n<pre><code>  @Override public HttpEndpointSupplier create(String endpoint) {\n    return new LoadBalancerHttpEndpointSupplier(loadBalancerClient, URI.create(endpoint));\n  }\n}\n\n@Override public String get() {\n  ServiceInstance instance = loadBalancerClient.choose(virtualURL.getHost());\n  if (instance != null) {\n    return instance.getUri() + virtualURL.getPath();\n  }\n  throw new IllegalArgumentException(virtualURL.getHost() + &amp;quot; is not registered&amp;quot;);\n}\n\n@Override public void close() {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">com.hazelcast:hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.4.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.4.0 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>CAUTION: Starting with this release of Hazelcast Platform, the minimum supported Java version is 17.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>User Code Namespaces: Enable deployment and redeployment of your custom classes. See the User Code Namespaces documentation.</li>\n<li>CPMap: Added CPMap as a minimal key-value CP data structure. See CPMap documentation. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25802\">#25802</a></li>\n<li>Thread-Per-Core (TPC): TPC is now generally available. You can enable this feature on the clients and cluster members for improved performance. See the Thread-Per-Core (TPC) documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>MergingValue</code> interface within the SPI package now requires the <code>getDeserializedValue()</code> method to be defined within implementations, replacing the <code>getValue()</code> definition. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25942\">#25942</a></li>\n<li>Moved the MongoDB connector to the extensions module, that is, its classes and related dependencies relocated;\nif you are using Maven to install the connector, you must add <code>&lt;classifier&gt;jar-with-dependencies&lt;/classifier&gt;</code> to your <code>pom.xml</code>.\nAlso removed the permissions for MongoDB connector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25744\">#25744</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25701\">#25701</a></li>\n<li>Method names used as parameters in <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html%5B%60SecurityInterceptor%60%5D\">https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html[`SecurityInterceptor`]</a> checks were reviewed and unified into a single place  - class <code>com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptorConstants</code>. Some client messages have the method name changed to reflect their purpose better. Some client messages are newly covered by <code>SecurityInterceptor</code> checks now. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25020\">#25020</a></li>\n<li>Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments to <code>hazelcast</code>.\nThe previous name, <code>hazelcast-service-port</code>, caused member auto-discovery for embedded deployments to fail. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24834\">#24834</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24705\">#24705</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24688\">#24688</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was not failing fast when a member is started with a blank public address.

The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>CAUTION: Starting with this release of Hazelcast Platform, the minimum supported Java version is 17.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>User Code Namespaces: Enable deployment and redeployment of your custom classes. See the User Code Namespaces documentation.</li>\n<li>CPMap: Added CPMap as a minimal key-value CP data structure. See CPMap documentation. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25802\">#25802</a></li>\n<li>Thread-Per-Core (TPC): TPC is now generally available. You can enable this feature on the clients and cluster members for improved performance. See the Thread-Per-Core (TPC) documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>MergingValue</code> interface within the SPI package now requires the <code>getDeserializedValue()</code> method to be defined within implementations, replacing the <code>getValue()</code> definition. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25942\">#25942</a></li>\n<li>Moved the MongoDB connector to the extensions module, that is, its classes and related dependencies relocated;\nif you are using Maven to install the connector, you must add <code>&lt;classifier&gt;jar-with-dependencies&lt;/classifier&gt;</code> to your <code>pom.xml</code>.\nAlso removed the permissions for MongoDB connector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25744\">#25744</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25701\">#25701</a></li>\n<li>Method names used as parameters in <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html%5B%60SecurityInterceptor%60%5D\">https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html[`SecurityInterceptor`]</a> checks were reviewed and unified into a single place  - class <code>com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptorConstants</code>. Some client messages have the method name changed to reflect their purpose better. Some client messages are newly covered by <code>SecurityInterceptor</code> checks now. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25020\">#25020</a></li>\n<li>Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments to <code>hazelcast</code>.\nThe previous name, <code>hazelcast-service-port</code>, caused member auto-discovery for embedded deployments to fail. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24834\">#24834</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24705\">#24705</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24688\">#24688</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was not failing fast when a member is started with a blank public address. This has been fixed by introducing a configuration validation\nthat might break any existing, but invalid, configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24729\">#24729</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>SQL/Jet Engine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the beta annotations from the data connection classes. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/26000\">#26000</a></li>\n<li>Replaced the user-defined types (UDTs) feature flag with the cyclic UDT feature flag, to prevent querying such type data. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25977\">#25977</a></li>\n<li>Added support for loading and storing a single column as the value using the <code>GenericMapStore</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25878\">#25878</a></li>\n<li>Each Jet engine job was creating a client for connecting to the remote cluster, resulting in an excessive number of clients.

Please read the notes carefully and refer to the PRs and associated issues for more\ndetails. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/blob/main/README.md\">README</a> contains useful information that should be reviewed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BREAKING: Split out incubating artifact. This repo now\npublishes <code>io.opentelemetry.semconv:opentelemetry-semconv:{{version}}</code> for semantic conventions\nwhich are stable (the artifact itself is not yet stable but we aim to stabilize eventually),\nand <code>io.opentelemetry.semconv:opentelemetry-semconv-incubating:{{version}}</code> for semantic\nconventions which are incubating (experimental) (this artifact will always have the <code>-alpha</code>\ndesignation). As a part of this restructuring, old attributes which were removed from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions\">semantic-conventions</a> (without being\ndeprecated there) have been removed.\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/41\">#41</a>)</li>\n<li>BREAKING: Generate classes by root namespace.

Bean introspection utility Beanspector relies on Class.getMethods natural order.\r\nFor most JVMs the Beanspector Tests will pass, however IBM Java does not return methods in the same ordering. Note: Class.getMethods does not provide a prescribed ordering of methods.\r\n\r\nWhen CXF 4.0.x main branch is built, we'll observe Apache CXF JAX-RS Extensions: Search fails test cases.\r\n\r\nWe can improve this behaviour by detecting when IBM Java is in use, and having IBM process declared methods first, then process remaining methods. This will make IBM behave more like other JVMs. \r\n\r\nBranch Tested on: \r\nWindows 11 Pro (Intel) with IBM Semeru 17.\r\nMacOS 14.4.1 (AArch64) with IBM Semeru 17, Bellsoft 17, and Zulu 17.\r\nCentOS Stream 9  (POWER) with IBM Semeru 17, RedHat OpenJDK 17, and Temurin

`WebClient` usage causes massive thread overhead. The suggested fix is to share the `HttpClient` instance (with reference counting) between many `HTTPConduit`s based on:\r\n - client policy \r\n - TLS client parameters \r\n\r\nThe shared `HttpClient` instances (references) are stored in the static cache capped at 100 (I believe the value is reasonably high taking into account that creation of many client `HTTPConduit`s, each with different policy and TLS settings is highly unlikely). The cache is thread safe and uses array list under the hood (switching to `ConcurrentHashMap` or alike was considered but requires more coding efforts and larger heap footprint which for a collection of 100 elements seems to be not beneficial). \r\n\r\nThe client per conduit behaviour  could be forced by setting `share.httpclient.http.conduit` contextual property to `false`(the default value is

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>Unreleased</h2>\n<h2>Version 1.24.0 (2024-03-27)</h2>\n<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> This release contains a significant restructuring of this repository and the generated\nclasses as we evolve it towards a first stable artifact (although there is no stable artifact as of\nthis release). Please read the notes carefully and refer to the PRs and associated issues for more\ndetails. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/blob/main/README.md\">README</a> contains useful information that should be reviewed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BREAKING: Split out incubating artifact. This repo now\npublishes <code>io.opentelemetry.semconv:opentelemetry-semconv:{{version}}</code> for semantic conventions\nwhich are stable (the artifact itself is not yet stable but we aim to stabilize eventually),\nand <code>io.opentelemetry.semconv:opentelemetry-semconv-incubating:{{version}}</code> for semantic\nconventions which are incubating (experimental) (this artifact will always have the <code>-alpha</code>\ndesignation). As a part of this restructuring, old attributes which were removed from\n<a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions\">semantic-conventions</a> (without being\ndeprecated there) have been removed.\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/41\">#41</a>)</li>\n<li>BREAKING: Generate classes by root namespace. Where previously all attributes were contained in\ntwo classes, <code>ResourceAttributes</code> and <code>SemanticAttributes</code>, they are now organized by their root\nnamespace. For example, the <code>http.request.header</code> attribute lives in <code>HttpAttributes</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/45\">#45</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix typo in readme\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/42\">#42</a>)</li>\n<li>Encode semconv version in build dir to fix build cache\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/51\">#51</a>)</li>\n<li>Cleanup enum generation\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/52\">#52</a>)</li>\n<li>Update readme to reflect new artifact strategy\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/53\">#53</a>)</li>\n<li>Use build-tools release 0.24.0\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/55\">#55</a>)</li>\n<li>Exclude namespaces that aren't useful in jvm environments\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/54\">#54</a>)</li>\n<li>Update to <code>semantic-conventions</code> 1.24.0\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/46\">#46</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 1.23.1 (2023-11-21)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended jinja template to generate template-type semantic attributes.\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/24\">#24</a>)</li>\n<li>Update to semconv 1.23.1\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/36\">#36</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 1.22.0 (2023-10-26)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to semconv 1.22\n(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java/pull/29\">#29</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
