17159](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17159) contains logic to convert a BQ Schema into a Beam Schema, but it seems like there's an issue with the new Beam release in calling the `bigquery_schema_tools.py` file. This PR fixes that. Note that this issue was highlited in my local IDE, but still compiled anyway and didn't get caught in our testing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23760\r\n\r\n<img

PR does 2 things:\r\n1. Moves the Tensorflow documentation next to the sklearn and pytorch documentation.\r\n2. Moves the keyedModel handler documentation to it's own section (instead of being TF specific).\r\n\r\nThe reason for #2 is that any framework may want to use keyed examples (not just TF).\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9816\">#9816</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1-rc1</h2>\n<p>#PHP</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>#Other</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.0</h2>\n<p>2022-03-25 version 3.20.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C#/Ruby/JavaScript)</p>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 support for CI and releases. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

#20824\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a WriteToBigQuery Dataflow pipeline is moved into draining phase, we can sometimes get file load operations with empty files, resulting in an error code 400: `Load configuration must specify at least one source URI` from BigQuery. These changes do a sanity check on partitions and decide to ignore partitions that have an empty list of files. Instead of an error, a warning is logged.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this happens during draining is not known as of yet, but these changes should be safe to

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9816\">#9816</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1-rc1</h2>\n<p>#PHP</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>#Other</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.0</h2>\n<p>2022-03-25 version 3.20.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C#/Ruby/JavaScript)</p>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 support for CI and releases. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

the timeout of the portable runner test for spawning up a portable runner process from 30 to 300 seconds.\r\n\r\nRelated issue https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22115\r\n\r\nPreviously the total test timeout was 60 seconds and an attempt to make the tests less flaky was done by increasing the total timeout to 600 (see https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12633).\r\n\r\nHowever, tests were

is a fix to an issue that isn't yet an issue, but could become one in #23587 unless fixed there. The issue is that when YAML is parsing 3.10 the number, it becomes 3.1 when translated back to a string.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  some-github-workflows-job:\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        # WARNING: Quotes needed for 3.10\r\n        python-version: [3.9, 3.10]\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4\r\n        with:\r\n          # WARNING: Quotes needed for 3.10, which is what\r\n          # ${{ matrix.python-version }} would resolve to if set to a string \"3.10\"\r\n          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I think the YAML is parsed twice making us need to quote both the `3.10` when we declare the `python-version` variable, and then once again after it is used in a text templating way to declare the input passed to the `actions/setup-python` action. Due to this, we need quotes in two places above, not just one.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[gradle-docker-compose-plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin) from 0.14.12 to 0.16.9.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/releases\">gradle-docker-compose-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.16.9</h2>\n<p>The level of a log message changed from lifecycle to info.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null to fallback to Docker default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null or empty value to reset to default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>New Gradle Publish plugin used</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>MacOS-specific defaults for executable and dockerExecutable removed</h2>\n<p>The defaults used to be <code>/usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code> and <code>/usr/local/bin/docker</code>, now it is just plain <code>docker-compose</code> and <code>docker</code> (for all platforms).</p>\n<h2>isRequiredBy changed in order not to break configuration avoidance</h2>\n<p>This release changes the behavior of <code>isRequiredBy</code> so the <code>Up</code> tasks should be executed as the last dependency of the configured task. Till now, we have this optimization for <code>classes</code> tasks only.</p>\n<p>As reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/352\">#352</a></p>\n<h2>Custom project name propagated correctly</h2>\n<p><code>projectName</code> property wasn't properly used due to a bug introduced in <code>0.16.0</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem was that the property was declared as a plain <code>String</code> instead of <code>Provider&lt;String&gt;</code>, so a change to the original value wasn't propagated to <code>ComposeExecutor</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>dockerExecutor initialized before used</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114815875\">reported</a>, it could happen that <code>dockerExecutor</code> was used before it was initialized. This release fixes this potential issue.</p>\n<h2>Tasks registration fixed</h2>\n<p>It is possible to get <code>A dependency must not be empty</code> error with <code>0.16.0</code> version of the plugin. This release should solve this issue (reported <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114623955\">here</a>).</p>\n<h2>Gradle Configuration Cache support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/351\">#351</a></p>\n<h2>Dots in default project name replaced</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/347\">#347</a></p>\n<h2>Services with dashes supported correctly</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/345\">#345</a></p>\n<h2>Docker Compose V2 support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/339\">avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin#339</a> thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/simondwilliams\"><code>@​simondwilliams</code></a></p>\n<h2>Gradle Plugin Portal publishing fixed</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/8155c72073039e293b9bd43cfbe6e6f068a31662\"><code>8155c72</code></a> feat: difference between states logged as info instead of lifecycle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/9f7f19b426d9ee6a0acba6e485f4f83a215d3545\"><code>9f7f19b</code></a> fix(deps): update dependency org.yaml:snakeyaml to v1.31</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/c15bc180a5fbaa3aacac7643f50016dec4127e4d\"><code>c15bc18</code></a> feat: setProjectName accepts null to fallback to Docker default Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/362\">#362</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/33cb6711f485b11fee3879dbeaf8c0a6a9ff2fba\"><code>33cb671</code></a> feat: setProjectName accepts null or empty value as reset Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/362\">#362</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/9f0201937e0f1d8e378c9b14d101a351b632ce64\"><code>9f02019</code></a> docs: Kotlin example on projectName fixed Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/362\">#362</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/c0958f74ed4ac82262cb890830417d2f356fb9fd\"><code>c0958f7</code></a> conf: Maven publishing fixed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/4a013c0c17190d547e347a7f865c1c21f0ac7707\"><code>4a013c0</code></a> chore(deps): update plugin com.gradle.plugin-publish to v1 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/361\">#361</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/601218ab0079a3fd8978efe337b66e7f416ae39c\"><code>601218a</code></a> feat: MacOS-specific defaults for executable and dockerExecutable removed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/a6afb552f505ed1efcbcc28bea9a7bc2bd88a86c\"><code>a6afb55</code></a> docs: correct set of projectName in Kotlin DSL example</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/c4a7e8e1b4bc06e4ad500358fbdd6b13610f54ca\"><code>c4a7e8e</code></a> feat: <code>isRequiredBy</code> changed in order not to break configuration avoidance (#...</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/compare/0.14.12...0.16.9\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.avast.gradle:gradle-docker-compose-plugin&package-manager=gradle&previous-version=0.14.12&new-version=0.16.9)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

in #11614 this was disabled in `WatchTest` instead of per-runner and then in #17471 that was moved to just the DirectRunner. The original flake was a DirectRunner flake on precommit so this particular variation is the one that would be expected to fail.\r\n\r\nVerified that it is working or less than 1% flaky for the DirectRunner today, via the following (plus a few ad hoc runs):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor i in `seq 1 100` ; do (\r\n  echo \"RUN $i\" ;\r\n   ./gradlew :runners:direct-java:cleanTest --quiet\r\n   ./gradlew :runners:direct-java:needsRunnerTests --quiet --tests WatchTest.testMultiplePollsWithManyResults\r\n)\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes #19734\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

that (some?) multi-project builds will encounter an error when applying <code>org.ajoberstar.grgit</code> or <code>org.ajoberstar.grgit.service</code> to multiple projects. This is caused by an upstream Gradle issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gradle/gradle/issues/17559\">gradle/gradle#17559</a> that is, as of 2/10/2022, is targeted to be fixed in 7.5.

discussed in issue #23541, `BigQueryAvroUtils` does not correctly generate the Avro schema for certain BigQuery data types, such as `Numeric` and `BigNumeric`. This PR address this issue and generates the correct avro schema.
