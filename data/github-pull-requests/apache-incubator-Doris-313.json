Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #11770\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n### Reason\r\nThe memory value automatically tracked by the tcmalloc hook in the DeltaWriter is smaller than the value recorded manually in the memtable, because the first 4096-byte Chunk requested by each MemPool when the memtable is initialized is not tracked to the DeltaWriter by the hook.\r\n\r\nThe values ​​of the two are not equal, causing the `mem_consumption() == _mem_table->memory_usage ` branch judgment to fail.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n`mem_consumption() == _mem_table->memory_usage `The purpose of this condition is to determine whether the current DeltaWriter has a memtable being flushed, increase flush_running_count in FlushToken, and completely separate `load channel mgr reduce mem` and `memtable > write_buffer_size` Two flush logic.\r\n\r\nMemory value automatically tracked by tcmalloc hook in DeltaWriter for load channel\r\n Flush memtable is triggered when the mem limit is exceeded. The manually recorded value of the memtable is used to flush the memtable when it is larger than write_buffer_size.\r\n\r\n### Can use independent variables to control flush\r\nWhen the flush is greater than write_buffer_size, it is already manually controlled independently;\r\nWhen the flush is larger than the mem limit, the tcmallloc hook is still used for automatic statistics, and the selection of the flush DeltaWriter is realized based on the hierarchical relationship of the mem tracker.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the memory value automatically tracked by the tcmalloc hook is 20% less than the manually recorded value in the memtable, because some of the freed memory is not allocated by the DeltaWriter. `\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

When the left memory is enough for sorting but not enough for next block, it will not flush row_block_arr which data in memory and continue to alloc next block so it can't alloc the memory and return directly. And if it can't alloc the memory for block, it need to flush row_block_arr and try it again unless row_block_arr is empty.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #11738\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n### motivation\r\nThe value of the query mem tracker is consistent with the physical memory actually used by the query.\r\n\r\n### problem causes\r\nCurrently, only the virtual memory used by the query can be tracked through the tcmalloc hook. When the memory is not fully used after the application, the recorded virtual memory will be larger than the physical memory.\r\n\r\nAt present, it is mainly because PODArray does not memset 0 when applying for memory, and blocks applied for through PODArray in places such as VOlapScanNode::_free_blocks are usually used for memory reuse and cannot be fully used.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nThe query mem tracker only records the peak memory used by PODArray and MemPool\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen we do write current plan with its child. Currently, nereids memo do nothing indeed.\r\nThis PR fix this situation by add a predicate in rewrite that only replaced target group and set newGroupExpressionGenerated to false when target is null or target is same with existed group expression's group.\r\n\r\nhere we need to handle one situation that original target is not the same with\r\nexistedGroupExpression.getOwnerGroup(). In this case, if we change target to\r\nexistedGroupExpression.getOwnerGroup(), we could not rewrite plan as we expected and the plan\r\nwill not be changed anymore.\r\nThink below example:\r\nWe have a plan like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOriginal (Group 2 is root):\r\nGroup2: Project(outside)\r\nGroup1: |---Project(inside)\r\nGroup0:     |---UnboundRelation\r\n\r\nand we want to rewrite group 2 by Project(inside, GroupPlan(group 0))\r\n\r\nAfter rewriting we should get (Group 2 is root):\r\nGroup2: Project(inside)\r\nGroup0: |---UnboundRelation\r\nGroup1: Project(inside)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter rewriting, Group 1's GroupExpression is not in GroupExpressionsMap anymore and Group 1 is unreachable.\r\nMerge Group 1 into Group 2 is better, but in consideration of there is others way to let a Group take into\r\nunreachable. There's no need to complicate to add a merge step. Instead, we need to have a clear step to\r\nremove unreachable groups and GroupExpressions after rewrite.\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #11644\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen ColumnIterator::next_batch put data from several pages to a batch, the 1st page may use DICT encoding while the 2nd page may use PLAIN encoding. Then we have to convert ColumnDictionary to PredicateColumn due to dict is not working any more.\r\n\r\nThere are two parts in a ColumnDictionary, codes and dict.  Codes is read from page decoder and converted if necessary to do range predicate. When a new batch is read, ColumnDictionary is cleared especially codes is  cleared, but dict is keep. So for a new batch, dict may be sorted but codes is same as on disk.\r\n\r\nSegmentIterator convert dict codes to do range predicate by calling convert_dict_codes_if_necessary.  However if a ColumnDictionary is changed PredicateColumn by ColumnIterator, SegmentIterator does not know it, so ColumnIterator should handle it by itself.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-11T11:19:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T03:10:41Z","closed_at":"2022-08-12T03:05:57Z","merged_at":"2022-08-12T03:05:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c8cc7f03e22d3a6163d40a57e839ae4557a16c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705186281,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg2Mjgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/storage","name":"area/storage","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently we use rapidjson to parse json document, It's fast but not fast enough compare to [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/basics.md).And I found that the simdjson has a parsing front-end called simdjson::ondemand which will parse json when accessing fields and could strip the field token from the original document, using this feature we could reduce the cost of string copy(eg. we convert everthing to a string literal in _write_data_to_column by sprintf, I saw a hotspot from the flamegrame in this function, using simdjson::to_json_string will strip the token(a string piece) which is std::string_view and this is exactly we need).And second in _set_column_value we could iterate through the json document by for (auto field: object_val) {xxx}, this is much faster than looking up a field by it's field name like objectValue.FindMember(\"k1\").The third optimization is the at_pointer interface[ simdjson provided](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/basics.md#json-pointer), this could directly get the json field from original document.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #11663\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nusing simdjson to parse in vjsonscanner.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n1. add `StatementContext`, and `PlannerContext` is renamed to `CascadsContext`. `CascadsContext` belong to a `StatementContext`, and `StatementContext` belong to a `ConnectionContext`, and the lifecycle increases in turn. StatementContext can wrap some statement's lifecycle-related state, such as ExpressionId, TableLock. `MemoTestUtil` can simplify create a CascadesContext and Memo for test.\r\n3. add `PlanPreprocessor` to process parsed logical plan before copy into memo. and add a `PlanPostprocessor` to process physical plan after copy out from memo.\r\n4. utilize PlanPreprocessor to process SET_VAR hint, the class is `EliminateLogicalSelectHint`\r\n5. pass the limit clause in regression test case, in `set_var.groovy`\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is part of light weight schema change https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/10136\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, vectorized engine will remove columns that only in delete predicate in segment iterator. But in non-vectorized engine, these columns in removed in tablet reader and they are copied in beta rowset reader.\r\n\r\nThis PR unified these logic to segment layer.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick
