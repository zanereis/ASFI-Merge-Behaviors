(Improvement) Before: the compactor checks whether the outputdir exists. If exists, it checks the property `compaction.force.reprocess`. If true, it will reprocess inputdir. If false, will skip inputdir.\n\nThis is problematic if inputdir and outputdir are the same. Then the fact that outputdir exists doesn't indicate whether it has been compacted or not.\n\nNow: after compaction is done, a file named `_COMPACTION_COMPLETE` will be created in outputdir. Property `compaction.force.reprocess` is no longer used. Now if outputdir exists and has `_COMPACTION_COMPLETE`, will skip inputdir. Otherwise, will process inputdir.\n- (Bug) Before: the outputdir is deleted immediately when it decides to process inputdir.\n\nAgain, this doesn't work if inputdir and outputdir are the same. Now: delete outputdir after the MR job is done.\n\nWe don't have a use case where inputdir = outputdir.

pull request is motivated by a case from the Kafka adapter that doesn't want to have job state persisted if the job failed (so to be consistent with the Camus behavior). This pull request has the following changes (UPDATED):\n1. `AbstractJobLauncher` will no longer persist job state of a job if its output data has not been committed successfully.\n2. Added a check in `MRJobLauncher` on the number of `TaskState`s collected from the mapper output. If this number is less than the expected number (the number of tasks launched), the job state is set to `FAILED`.\n3. Code refactoring.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yinan Li

the following bugs:\n- `KafkaExtractor.shouldLogError()`, original logic was wrong.

Otherwise, if `allPartitionsFinished()=true`, `currentPartitionFinished()` will fail because there's no current partition.\n- `KafkaExtractor.readRecordImpl()`: LOG should print out stack trace.\n- `KafkaExtractor.moveToNextPartition()`: added a `if` block around `switchMetricContextToCurrentPartition`, since if all partitions are finished, then there's no current partition.\n- `KafkaAvroSchemaRegistry.getSchemaByID()`: throw `SchemaNotFoundException` instead of

as part of pul request #120, the method `commitJob(JobContext jobContext)` in `OutputCommitter` was overriden in  `GobblinOutputCommitter`, which called `cleanUpWorkingDirectory` \nto delete the working directory of the MR job upon completion and committing of the MR job. However, there are two versions of the method `commitJob(JobContext jobContext)`, one using `org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobContext`, and the other using `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobContext`. The one that was overriden is the latter, and this is the one called in Hadoop 2. The issue is that the Gobblin job needs to read the task states stored under the working directory after the Hadoop job finishes, at which point the working directory has already been deleted if run on Hadoop 2. The issue didn't show up in Hadoop 1 is because the version of that method for Hadoop 1 was not overriden.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yinan Li

recent change on writer file naming allows user to fully control the writer file name including its extension through the configuration property `writer.file.name`. This property used to be used as the prefix for writer file names that will also include the task IDs, which guarantees that each task writes to a different file. However, the test job configurations explicitly set `writer.file.name=gobblin-test`, which means every tasks of a job will write to the same file. This issue shows up in `LocalJobLauncherTest` and `MRJobLauncherTest` in the form of `WARN` messages that complained that a writer of a task is trying to write to an existing file named `gobblin-test`. This commit fixed the tests by removing `writer.file.name` from the test job configurations.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yinan Li

Refactored `KafkaSource` and `KafkaExtractor` for the complex watermark:\n\nNow each WorkUnit in a MultiWorkUnit returned by `KafkaSource.getWorkUnits()` is\nresponsible for pulling multiple Kafka partitions of the same topic, so that\nthese partitions can share output files rather than creating its own output files.\n\nTo this end, a method `KafkaSource.squeezeMultiWorkUnits()` is added to combine all WorkUnits in a MultiWorkUnit into a single WorkUnit.\n\n`KafkaExtractor.readRecord()` is rewritten to pull from multiple partitions.\n- Small modification to complex watermark:\n  - Changed the implementation of `WorkUnit.getLowWatermark` and\n    `WorkUnit.getExpectedHighWatermark`. The original implementation doesn't work and\n    throws \"Not a JsonObject\" exceptions. \n  - Changed return type of\n    `WorkUnitState.getActualHighWatermark()` from `JsonElement` to `String`. In the\n    original implementation, `GSON.toJsonTree(String)` will convert `\"` in the input\n    string to `\\\"` in the JsonElement, which will break if we pass this JsonElement to GSON.fromJson.\n  - Added method `setWatermarkInterval` to `SourceState`, since we need a way to assign watermarks to workunits.\n- Modified the best fit implementation in KafkaSource, the original one was incorrect.\n- Modified the worst fit implementation in KafkaSource, using a MinMaxPriorityQueue to improve efficiency.\n- Use `com.google.common.net.HostAndPort`\n- Other small refactoring for better readability.\n","created_at":"2015-05-19T03:17:32Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T18:16:39Z","closed_at":"2015-05-26T18:15:54Z","merged_at":"2015-05-26T18:15:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b7d10dd25ec2b4a3572ff0c7b1f9f49ebfc6563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":153127084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxMjcwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/78cf4cc52c9688a8e18289c8cd958982b9190d70","head":{"label":"zliu41:newWm","ref":"newWm","sha":"78cf4cc52c9688a8e18289c8cd958982b9190d70","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32048123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjA0ODEyMw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"zliu41/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"http

is the first version of work on adding support for optionally throttling data extraction in the Extractor. The changes are summarized as follows:\n1. Added a new interface `Limiter` and three implementations: `RateBasedLimiter`, `TimeBasedLimiter`, `CountBasedLimiter`, and `PoolBasedLimiter` that limits the rate, total time elapsed, total permits available (with no refills), and total permits available in a pool with refills, respectively.\n2. Added a `LimiterFactory` for building `Limiter`s.\n3. Added some new configuration properties for the new `Limiter`s.\n4. Added a new class `LimitingExtractorDecorator` that applies throttling using a given `Limiter` to the `Extractor` it wraps.\n5. `TaskContext.getExtractor` now returns a `LimitingExtractorDecorator` if throttling is enabled.\n6.

is the first pull request for adding complex watermark types to Gobblin. This will replace the legacy system of tracking watermarks. The old system was de-centralized, and depended and passing custom configuration parameters between executions via a `WorkUnitState`.\n\nThe new implementation contains a new interface called `Watermark` which extends the `Comparable` and the `Copyable` interfaces. It only contains one method `increment(Object record)` which defines how to increment the watermark for a given record.\n\nAnother class called `WatermarkInterval` contains the logic for maintaining low and high watermarks. The corresponding changes to `WorkUnit` and `WorkUnitState` have been made. Since this pull request mainly focuses on defining the interfaces, no migration code has been done to the framework yet.\n","created_at":"2015-05-04T21:15:41Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T18:20:09Z","closed_at":"2015-05-15T18:20:04Z","merged_at":"2015-05-15T18:20:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"52cd12bf79baeae9cdaa0e7c09aa5e52826302cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/121/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/121/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/121/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3284898bacd4d9e9c05caff90d8e3e473cb95ccd","head":{"label":"sahilTakiar:complexWatermarks","ref":"complexWatermarks","sha":"3284898bacd4d9e9c05caff90d8e3e473cb95ccd","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f5bebda6ba3b624f9c451d9fcb162cdccad37633","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

the old Kafka API, the type of message key and value are both ByteBuffer. In the new API they've become generic. Also, currently the Kafka adapter depends on `MessageAndOffset`, which is part of the old API, and doesn't exist in the new API. So the following changes have been made to the Kafka adapter:\n- `MessageAndOffset` is replaced by interface `KafkaEvent<K, V>`, so that `KafkaExtractor` and `KafkaAvroExtractor` no longer depend on `MessageAndOffset`. When using the old API, `KafkaEvent` is implemented by `KafkaOldEvent`, which wraps a `MessageAndOffset` object. When using the new API, `KafkaEvent` is implemented by `KafkaNewEvent` (not yet created, new API will be in a separate branch), which wraps a `ConsumerRecord<K, V>` object.\n- `KafkaExtractor<S, D>` becomes `KafkaExtractor<S, K, V, D>`. \n- `KafkaWrapper` becomes `KafkaWrapper<K, V>`.\n- `KafkaAvroExtractor` now extends `KafkaExtractor<Schema, ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer, GenericRecord>`. A different subclass of KafkaExtractor that uses the new API may use different key and value types than `ByteBuffer`.

Implemented Kafka multiworkunit using bin packing algorithms. The goal is to evenly assign all workunits (each corresponding to a kafka partition) to the multiWorkUnits, while preferring to assign partitions of the same topic to the same multiWorkUnit (to avoid generating many small files).\n\n_Note that currently it is not possible to avoid generating small files. Even if we assign multiple partitions of the same topic to the same multiWorkUnit, it will still create one file for each partition, rather than one file for the whole topic. It is currently neither possible to let multiple tasks share a writer (since tasks may run in parallel) nor possible to let each workUnit process multiple partitions (since each workUnit can only have one highwatermark). However, in the future if we change the design of watermarks such that it can hold multiple values, then a multiWorkUnit will be able to create one file for each topic, rather than each partition._\n\nThe algorithm is slightly improved from Camus'. It first groups workUnits into approximately 3 \\* numOfMultiWorkunits groups using best-fit-decreasing, such that partitions of the same topic are in the same group (Camus uses an inferior algorithm for this step that may mix different topics in the same group). Then, assemble these groups into multiWorkunits using worst-fit-decreasing.\n\nThe first step uses best-fit-decreasing since the target is to group the partitions of each topic into as few groups as possible given a group size limit, so that partitions of the same topic are more likely to be assigned to the same mapper. Using a group size limit ensures that there are a sufficient number of groups for the second step, which is necessary for the second step to do an even assignment.\n\nThe reason behind 3\\* is that the worst-fit-decreasing algorithm should work well if the number of items is more than 3 times the number of bins.\n\nThe second step uses worst-fit-decreasing since the target is to evenly assign groups to multiWorkUnits.\n- Changed the way Avro records from Kafka are written. Previously the AvroHdfsDataWriter calls setSchema() for each record whose schema is different from the current schema. This actually doesn't work since an avro file can only have one schema, and if we write records with different schemas to one file, the file cannot be decoded. Now KafkaAvroExtractor will convert the schema of a record if its schema is different from the latest schema of that

Etractor.readRecord() takes an instance of the data record class, which gives the Etractor chances to reuse the same data record. Originally, the purpose of having this was for performance reason. However, extracted data records now go to the forks through a blocking record queue, which may hold multiple references to the same data records if the writer is slower than the extractor. Allowing data record reuse will lead to undesired or even unexpected behavior if a data record is mutated while the queue is still holding more than one references to it. This commit changed the Extractor interface to disallow data record reuse.\n\nThis commit will break `Extractor` implementation classes in other repos. It will also break classes that extend the following classes that have been renamed in this commit:\n1. `HadoopExtractor` => `AvroFileExtractor`.\n2. `HadoopSource` => `AvroFileSource`.\n3. `DatePartitionedExtractor` => `DatePartitionedAvroFileExtractor`.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yinan Li

Removed the use of `SourceState` in `AbstractJobLauncher` and used `JobState` instead, which has everything in the `SourceState`.\n3. Added a new test `JobStateStoreTest` that uses a `TestJobLauncher` to simulate running the job multiple times and check the job state between runs.\n4.

patch addresses the following issues:\n\n1.\nFix conf files loading:\nThe Configuration object is populated from the Hadoop conf xmls defined in the `hadoop.configfile.*` properties. However, `HdfsIO#addHadoopConfigPropertiesToConf` calls\n `Configuration#addResource(String)`. This method only examines the classpath for the given file name. Thus if the file is not on the classpath, the Configuration object will remain empty\n\n2.\nEnsure the correct order of the HDFS_URI resolution:\nIf `fs.defaultFS` is set to the default value before the conf files are loaded, then it won't get overridden by either the value in `core-site.xml` or in `hdfs.uri`. The resolved `hdfs.uri` should not only be set to the Configuration object, but to the `CompactionRunner.properties`, because `HdfsIO#getHdfsUri` use that object for the resolution.\n\n3.\nLoad Hive JDBC driver with the default hiveserver.version value if it is not set:\nThe docs states that the default `hiveserver.version` is 2. But if it is not set by the user, the `HiveJdbcConnector#newConnectorWithProps` will not load the driver.\n\n4.\nFix the splitting of comma separated column names in snapshot.pkey and delta.i.pkey:\n`CompactionRunner#buildAvroExternalTable` passes `jobProperties.getProperty(tableType + PKEY))` as parameter to `HiveTable#withPrimaryKeys(String firstKeyAttr, String... remainingKeyAttr)` . Even if the parameter contains commas, it won't be split automaticaly \nbetween the first and variable length paramteres; `firstKeyAttr` will store the whole string.\n\n5.\nIf multiple primary keys are defined in the `task.conf`, the LEFT JOIN and the WHERE clause of the INSERT OVERWRITE statement will be broken, e.g:\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE not_updated\nSELECT merged_delta.\\* FROM merged_delta LEFT OUTER JOIN delta2 ON merged_delta.my_id1,my_id2 = delta2.my_id1,my_id2\nWHERE delta2.my_id1,my_id2 IS NULL\n","created_at":"2015-04-21T22:41:29Z","updated_at":"2015-05-31T13:48:47Z","closed_at":"2015-05-04T16:00:40Z","merged_at":"2015-05-04T16:00:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"57990ecd63ebb6e2926da9d959574d5b055e0c68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/abde0386c2b8da27047b5d7f06d77809263b58d5","head":{"label":"lbendig:tmp2","ref":"tmp2","sha":"abde0386c2b8da27047b5d7f06d77809263b58d5","user":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":31592005,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU5MjAwNQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"lbendig/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lbendig/gobblin/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_ur

pull request includes the following changes:\n1. Added two custom ContextAwareScheduledReporters that report metrics as Hadoop counters, one for the old Hadoop API and the other for the new Hadoop API. Currently only Codahale Counters are reported as Hadoop counters as semantically they are equivalent.  I am not sure though if it would make sense to report other types of metrics as Hadoop counters. Most other types of metrics have measurements on rates and durations, which are doubles but can be converted to long integers with precision lost. So I would like to hear your thoughts on this.\n2. Added a GraphiteReporter for reporting metrics to Graphite.\n3. Reorganized the code by moving Kafka reporter classes to their own package under `gobblin.metrics`.\n4. Moved `JobMetrics` from `gobblin-metrics` to `gobblin-runtime`. This allows removing the dependency of gobblin-metrics on gobblin-api, making gobblin-metrics a stand-alone module without depending on any other gobblin modules.\n5. Deleted the unused JobMetricStore and its InfluxDB-based implementation as they have not been used since they were created. We will have a new InfluxDB reporter based on the new metric APIs in the future.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yinan Li
