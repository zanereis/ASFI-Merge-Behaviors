design : https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5567\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n#### Abstract\r\n\r\nAdd Lock-Free executor to improve hoodie writing throughput and optimize execution efficiency.\r\nDisruptor linked: https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/user-guide/index.html#_introduction\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nAbstractly, hoodie consumes upstream data (Kafka or S3 files) into the lake is a standard production-consumption model. Currently, Hudi uses `LinkedBlockingQueue` as a message queue between Producer and Consumer.\r\n\r\nHowever, this lock model may become the bottleneck of application throughput when data volume is much larger. What's worse is that even if we increase the number of the executors, it is still difficult to improve the throughput.\r\n\r\nIn other words, users may encounter throughput bottlenecks when writing data into hudi in some scenarios, and increasing the physical hardware scale and parameter tuning cannot solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\n![](DisruptorExecutor.png)\r\n\r\n1. Abstraction: first abstract the produce-consume process into three parts\r\n  - Producer interface: Fill the hoodie data into the inner message queue.\r\n  - Executor interface: Initialize, schedule and manage producers and consumers, and hold inner message queues. Executor controls the entire life cycle of data production and consumption.\r\n  - Consumer interface: Consumes data from inner message queue and write to hudi file.\r\n\r\n2. Following the abstract logic in party1, use the lock-free circular queue Disruptor as the inner message queue of the Executor\r\n  - Implement the producer abstraction in party1 and customize the `DisruptorBasedProducer` which will consume and set data to RingBuffer.\r\n  - Implement the abstraction of Executor. Also control the life cycle through Ringbuffer information and related APIs. Customize `HoodieDaemonThreadFactory` to control Thread behavior.\r\n  - Implement Consumer abstraction, define `DisruptorMessageHandler` to control consumption and clear data in Disruptor.\r\n\r\n3. New parameters\r\n  - `hoodie.write.executor.type`: Set executor which orchestrates concurrent producers and consumers communicating through a message queue. \r\n  Default value is `BOUNDED_IN_MEMORY_EXECUTOR` which use a bounded in-memory queue using `LinkedBlockingQueue`. \r\n  Also users could use `DISRUPTOR_EXECUTOR`, which use disruptor as a lock free message queue to gain better writing performance. \r\n  Although `DISRUPTOR_EXECUTOR` is still an experimental feature.\r\n  - `hoodie.write.buffer.size`: The size of the Disruptor Executor ring buffer, must be power of 2\r\n  - `hoodie.write.wait.strategy`: Strategy employed for making DisruptorExecutor wait on a cursor.\r\n\r\n4. limitation\r\n  For now, this disruptor executor is **only supported for spark insert and spark bulk insert operation**. Other operations like spark upsert is still on going.\r\n\r\nAlso use **this new disruptor based executor will consume more cpu and memory resources**.\r\n\r\n## Rollout/Adoption Plan\r\n\r\nDefault executor is `BOUNDED_IN_MEMORY_EXECUTOR` which use a bounded in-memory queue using LinkedBlockingQueue same as now.\r\nSo there is no impact on existing users.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Test Plan\r\n1. Add UT `TestDisruptorMessageQueue` and `TestDisruptorExecutionInSpark` to guard above logic, also validate data correctness.\r\n2. Add Benchmark `BoundInMemoryExecutorBenchmark` benchmark with BoundInMemoryExecutor(old) and DisruptorExecutior(new option)\r\n\r\nThis Patch is tested on dev env, I think it's ready for review.\r\nAlthough need more java docs here.\r\n\r\nHere is the **simple schema and spark bulk_insert benchmark locally result** between old BoundInMemoryExecutor and new DisruptorExecutor getting **_2.0X_** performance improved :)\r\n```\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8259CL CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\nCOW Ingestion:                            Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBoundInMemory Executor                             5557           5607          70          0.2        5556.9       1.0X\r\nDisruptor Executor                                 2758           2778          28          0.4        2757.7       2.0X\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/164981281-575b4a17-e22f-4cbb-bfda-29166e016ba2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI also do several performance tests recently including\r\n\r\n**Simple schema (several columns) + small amount of data** and **complex schema (dozens of columns) and large amount of data** using bulk_insert.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Simple schema + small amount of data** like the bench mark showed, we may get better performance result from 60% to 2X\r\n\r\nAs for **complex schema (dozens of columns) and large amount of data**:\r\n**1000 partitions, 100,000,000 records, dozens of columns** and 20 * r5.12xlarge instants. We can get about 20% performance improved.\r\n\r\nAnother conclusion is that  the more data-producing faster than data consuming, the more benefit we can get from this PR. In this scenario, locking is the performance bottleneck.\r\n\r\nFor normal scenes, we can get about 20% performance improvement.\r\n\r\nBench Marks in details\r\n\r\n|data size|column size|performance tuning|\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |\r\n|1,000,000 records|7 |2X(In Local benchmark) |\r\n|100,000,000 records|15 |23% (In real world) |\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/benchmark/BoundInMemoryExecutorBenchmark.scala for more details.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nWriter-core module.\r\n\r\n### Risk level medium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nFrom our experience, we have two kinds of **spark-streaming** ingestion job.\r\n1.

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nDon't keep the last commit before the earliest commit to retain \r\nAccording to the document of  `hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained`:\r\n```java\r\nNumber of commits to retain, without cleaning. \r\nThis will be retained for num_of_commits * time_between_commits   (scheduled). \r\nThis also directly translates into how much data retention the table supports for incremental queries.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe only need to keep the number of commit configured through parameters  `hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained`.\r\nAnd the commit retained by clean is completed.This ensures that “This will be retained for num_of_commits * time_between_commits” in the document.\r\n\r\nSo we don't need to keep the last commit before the earliest commit to retain,If we want to keep more versions, we can increase the parameters  `hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-23T08:28:15Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T19:30:33Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHiveConf is getting eagerly loaded when HoodieSparkSqlWriter is touched. Strangely this happens only with spark2 and scala12 and not w/ any other profiles. And after inspecting the usages, looks like we don't really need to use HiveConfig in HoodieSparkSqlWriter, all we need is HadoopConf. So, have fixed the usage. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Removed unintended usage of HiveConf in HoodieSparkSqlWriter. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests.\r\nRan quick start locally and verified that w/ the patch, it succeeds. and w/o the patch, we get failure w/ spark2 and scala12.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n#5364 made extraction of values for partition columns from partition path became configurable, _disabling_ it by default, \r\nsince by default Hudi persists partition columns in the data file which could be fetched directly instead of parsing partition values from partition path.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a fallback configuration allowing to control whether partition values should be parsed from the partition path (which is default Spark behavior).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Unified shouldOmitPartitionColumns and `shouldExtractPartitionValuesFromPartitionPath` flags\r\n - Added new `EXTRACT_PARTITION_VALUES_FROM_PARTITION_PATH`\r\n - Added test\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAfter we did a fallback to `HadoopFsRelation` in #5352, old issues of HUDI-3204 re-surfaced due to the fact that Spark forcibly appends partition values parsed from the actual partition path to the fetched dataset.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this behavior is not configurable, and therefore to address this problem we have to override default `ParquetFileFormat` w/ our own modified instance that overrides this behavior: our own extension for `ParquetFileFormat` make such behavior configurable -- caller can configure whether it would prefer \r\n\r\n - To append partition values parsed from the actually partition path \r\n - To avoid appending such partition values and instead rely on reading the source columns being used as partition values (Hudi-specific behavior)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Scaffolded `Spark24HoodieParquetFileFormat` extending `ParquetFileFormat` and overriding the behavior of adding partition columns to every row\r\n - Amended `SparkAdapter`s `createHoodieParquetFileFormat` API to be able to configure whether to append partition values or not\r\n - Fallback to append partition values in cases when the source columns are not persisted in data-file\r\n - Fixing HoodieBaseRelation incorrectly handling mandatory columns\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-19T18:55:25Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T19:23:08Z","closed_at":"2022-04-20T11:30:27Z","merged_at":"2022-04-20T11:30:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f7544e23ac6899b2d8b28a01c79caad1facd1379","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/5364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/5364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/64dd7b1a59d215289d97578dcd0943b4d9764dcd","head":{"label":"onehouseinc:ak/ts-kgen-fix","ref":"ak/ts-kgen-fix","sha":"64dd7b1a59d215289d97578dcd0943b4d9764dcd","user":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378248722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDg3MjI=","name":"hudi","full_name":"onehouseinc/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `NoClassDefFoundError` due to `org.apache.hudi.schema.FilebasedSchemaProvider`.  The class is not packaged to the hudi-kafka-connect-bundle because of changes in flink modules from #5072 (Right now, Kafka Connect Sink for Hudi temporarily relies on schema provider classes in Flink that do not use Spark context).  The PR corrects the shade include rule for the flink module.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hudi/schema/FilebasedSchemaProvider\r\n    at

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSpark unfortunately predicates some of its optimization `Rule`s (and some other handling) on usage of `HadoopFsRelation` which leads to those optimizations not being applied when we rely on our custom `Relation` impls. \r\n\r\nTo work this around for the 0.11, we fallback to `HadoopFsRelation` in cases when it's feasible to do so.\r\n\r\n> NOTE: We're partially restoring [logic present in 0.10.1](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/cc3896be2a023f8819883d745178503286ac2ab1/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/DefaultSource.scala#L182)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Adding `toHadoopFsRelation` method for `BaseFileOnlyRelation`\r\n - Fallback to `HadoopFsRelation` for non-Schema Evolution use-cases\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- So far, archival will stop at the first savepointed commit and will not proceed further. For users who may not be interested in incremental queries, but just \"as of instant\", we can let them proceed further by skipping just the savepointed commit. This opens up new opportunities for hudi users. For eg, one can retain commits for years, by adding one savepoint per day for older commits (say > 30 days old).  And they can query hudi using \"as of instant\" for very old data. If not, one has to retain every commit and let archival stop at first commit which may not be a good experience for users. \r\n- Had to fix one the core methods in HoodieTimeline with this change boolean isBeforeTimelineStarts(String instant); Please do check the changes here. Prior to this patch, we don't allow any holes in the timeline. As instant is considered committed if its part of active timeline or if its < first entry in active timeline. But since we are letting archival go beyond savepoints, there could be holes in the active timeline. \r\nFor eg; C1, C2, C3, Savepoint_C3, C4, C5, Savepoint_C5, C6, C7, C8, C9. \r\nLets say, C1, C2, C4, and C6 are archived (with the fix in this patch. If not, archival will not proceed after C2). \r\n\r\nso, active line is : C3, savepoint_C3, C5, Savepoint_C5, C7, C8, C9. \r\nSo, if a Filegroup committed with C4 is checked for isBeforeTimelineStarts(String instant), we might return false. So, the fix is to find the first unsavepointed commit in active timeline and treat that as the first entry in active timeline. Any instant < this first unsavepointed commit will be considered a valid completed commit. \r\nSo, in above case, its C6. so, isBeforeTimelineStarts(C4) will return true. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new config named `hoodie.archive.proceed.beyond.savepoints` which will guard this behavior. Have set the default value to false to retain old behavior. \r\n- When this config is enabled, archival will skip savepointed commits and will proceed further to archive other commits. when disabled archival will stop at first savepointed commit. \r\n- Fixed implementation of isBeforeTimelineStarts(String instant) to cater to holes in active timeline to deduce valid completed commits. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- TestHoodietTimelineArchiver.testSavepointsWithArchival\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, drop index deletes the partition but leaves any pending instant on the timeline. If we do not delete the pending index instants, then compaction may not kick in the MDT. This PR fixes the behavior.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Update dropIndex API in `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter`\r\n- Add UT for the scenario\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added a UT, which schedules column_stats index but then calls drop index, so the indexing.requested should be deleted.\r\n- Manually verified for indexing.inflight by killing the regular writer.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdding new bulk-insert mode `PARTITION_NO_SORT` which performs re-partitioning using `hoodie.table.partition.fields`, without additional sorting w/in the partition which allows to address following issues: \r\n\r\n1. Using `NONE` mode while bulk-inserting into partitioned table (with N partitions and parallelism P) unless inserted dataset has been re-partitioned prior using table's partition columns, at least N x P files will be created (at least P files in every partition). This occurs simply b/c w/o any repartitioning or sorting (on partition column) every Spark partition is likely to contain records belonging to every partition, therefore every executor handling individual partitions will be writing into table's every physical partition independently producing poorly sized tables. Example of that could be found in the HUDI-3883.\r\n2. Using `GLOBAL_SORT` or `PARTITION_SORT`, aforementioned problem is alleviated (b/c the dataset is ordered/partitioned by the partition column) but it adds an overhead of the need to do global/local sorting (while bringing benefits files ordered by primary key which is beneficial for upsert performance)\r\n\r\nThat way `PARTITION_NO_SORT` is a middle-ground which is still performing re-partitioning aligning well Spark partitions with table's physical partitions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Cleaning up existing partitioner impls (avoiding unnecessary transformations, simplifying) \r\n - Added new `PartittionNoSortPartitioner`\r\n - Added tests\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRight now, any `HoodieAsyncService` would be awaiting for 24h for its executor to shutdown gracefully. This however poses a problem in cases when such executor is spinning non-daemon threads, as this might prevent JVM from shutting down for those 24h, in cases when executors continue running (for ex, in a crash loop).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Reducing executor graceful shutdown timeout to 1m from 24h\r\n - Fixed `DeltaSyncService` to properly override `shutdown` method and invoke one from super-class for proper shutting down\r\n - Cleaning up some NPEs previously observed in tests\r\n - Tidying up\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- TestHoodieDeltastreamer.testHoodieAsyncClusteringJob has been flaky in CI and hence it was disabled. Fixing it in this patch. \r\nContext: we can't schedule async clustering when regular writers are making commits if they are overlapping. So, for now, have fixed the flakiness to stop ingestion and ensure the clustering job is able to scheduled and execute. But we need to fix the data generation in general. Have also created a follow up ticket. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3872 to work on test data generation to cover many more cases for async clustering in general. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed flakiness around testHoodieAsyncClusteringJob in tests. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n- Fix itself is in tests only \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n
