What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new API `dropNamespace(String[] ns, boolean cascade)` to replace the existing one: Add a boolean parameter `cascade` that supports deleting all the Namespaces and Tables under the namespace.\r\n\r\nAlso include changing the implementations and tests that are relevant to this API.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass `isDeterministic` flag to `ApplyFunctionExpression`, `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke` when processing V2 scalar functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA V2 scalar function can be declared as non-deterministic. However, currently Spark doesn't pass the flag when converting the V2 function to a catalyst expression, which could lead to incorrect results if being applied with certain optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test.","created_at":"2022-01-18T21:57:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T07:17:17Z","closed_at":"2022-01-19T22:08:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"044d856e483624cb99c429e6af6137c4282fd3c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/774ae348f991f49b9b6bed6287d2751714cb66d5","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-37957","ref":"SPARK-37957","sha":"774ae348f991f49b9b6bed6287d2751714cb66d5","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

function with no return.\r\n```python-traceback\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.typedef.typehints import infer_return_type\r\n>>> def f():\r\n...     pass\r\n... \r\n>>> infer_return_type(f)\r\nTraceback

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe defualt statistics estimation only consider the size in bytes, which may lost the row rount and columns statistics.\r\n\r\nThe `RebalancePartitions` actually does not change the statistics of plan, so we can use the statistics of its child for more accurate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only affect the statistics of plan\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe memory leak of `ExecutionListenerBus` was fixed in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4d90c5dc0efcf77ef6735000ee7016428c57077b by automatically cleaning it up when the `SparkSession` is GC'ed.\r\nThis is a similar fix for the memory leak of `SQLAppStatusListener` that occurs when a new `SessionState` is touched.  The memory leak is automatically cleaned up when the `SharedState` is GC'ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe memory leak causes OOM in spark applications like Spark Thrift Server that creates many sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA test has been added to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the ExtractGenerator rule to extract a generator from a GeneratorOuter expression contained by a Generate operator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from values 1, 2 lateral view outer explode(array()) as b;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from values 1, 2 lateral view explode_outer(array()) as b;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt produces the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in query: Column 'b' does not exist. Did you mean one of the following? [col1]; line 1 pos 26;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the parser directly creates a Generate operator with the (as of yet unresolved) generator function. Later, the ResolveFunctions rule converts the unresolved function to a resolved generator wrapped by a GeneratorOuter expression. Although the ExtractGenerator rule will extract the generator function from a GeneratorOuter, it doesn't work if the GeneratorOuter is an expression in a Generate operator. Because the generator is not extracted, the ResolveGenerator rule fails to match on the Generate operator, and therefore fails to turn the generator's output expressions into attributes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing unit tests.\r\n- New unit

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen using non-deterministic function, the method getAllValidConstraints can throw an OOM\r\n\r\n```\r\n  protected def getAllValidConstraints(projectList: Seq[NamedExpression]): ExpressionSet = {\r\n    var allConstraints = child.constraints\r\n    projectList.foreach {\r\n      case a @ Alias(l: Literal, _) =>\r\n        allConstraints += EqualNullSafe(a.toAttribute, l)\r\n      case a @ Alias(e, _) =>\r\n        // For every alias in `projectList`, replace the reference in constraints by its attribute.\r\n        allConstraints ++= allConstraints.map(_ transform {\r\n          case expr: Expression if expr.semanticEquals(e) =>\r\n            a.toAttribute\r\n        })\r\n        allConstraints += EqualNullSafe(e, a.toAttribute)\r\n      case _ => // Don't change.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    allConstraints\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn particular, this line `allConstraints ++= allConstraints.map(...)` can generate an exponential number of expressions\r\nThis is because non deterministic functions are considered unique in a ExpressionSet\r\nTherefore, the number of non-deterministic expressions double every time we go through this line\r\n\r\nWe can filter and keep only deterministic expression because\r\n1 - the `semanticEquals` automatically discard non deterministic expressions\r\n2 - this method is only used in one code path, and we keep only determinic expressions\r\n```\r\nlazy val constraints: ExpressionSet = {\r\n    if (conf.constraintPropagationEnabled) {\r\n      validConstraints\r\n        .union(inferAdditionalConstraints(validConstraints))\r\n        .union(constructIsNotNullConstraints(validConstraints, output))\r\n        .filter { c =>\r\n          c.references.nonEmpty && c.references.subsetOf(outputSet) && c.deterministic\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n      ExpressionSet()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt can lead to an exponential number of expressions and / or OOM\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark should remove check field name when reading/writing  parquet files.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport spark reading existing parquet files with special chars in column names.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSuch as  parquet, user can use spark to read existing files with special chars in column names. And then can use back quote  to wrap special column name such as  &#96;max(t)&#96; or use &#96;max(t)&#96; as &#96;max_t&#96;, then user can use `max_t`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe memory leak that was partially fixed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28128 doesn't cover the case where sessionState is touched. From the initial description: \"Once SessionState is touched, it will add two more listeners into the SparkContext, namely SQLAppStatusListener and ExecutionListenerBus.\"\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes a memory leak that that can cause a spark application to oom if many spark sessions are created\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test included as a part of the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34719. It added a test but it is flaky due to the order of `TABLPROPERTIES` in `SHOW CREATE TALBE` on `VIEW` in v1 code path.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to have a deterministic order by sorting the table properties in the show command. This is already being sorted in v2 (see `ShowCreateTableExec`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo have the deterministic order, and fix the flaky test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nVirtually no. It might affect the order of TABLEPROPERTIES in `SHOW TABLE`'s output on `VIEW` when users are rely on \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFixed the flaky unittest to explicitly test the order.","created_at":"2022-01-17T01:15:41Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:51Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T02:51:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bdc04f298c7e14e3588122b6480c13bbfd48677","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e4279f4b18ca14f3838084d1a6b0c431feccaad","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-37924","ref":"SPARK-37924","sha":"5e4279f4b18ca14f3838084d1a6b0c431feccaad","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR rolls back global exclude on F403 introduced in SPARK-37909.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can use file-specific on major offenders (test files).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBased on [CI behavior](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35199#discussion_r784526473) and local test runs, it seems like it takes precedence over F401 and silences unused import errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImprove `RebalancePartitions` in following rules:\r\n- `NestedColumnAliasing`\r\n- `CollapseRepartition `\r\n- `EliminateSorts`\r\n- `FoldablePropagation`\r\n- `PropagateEmptyRelationBase`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter SPARK-37267, we support do optimize rebalance partitions in everywhere of plan rather than limit to the root node. So It should make sense to also let `RebalancePartitions` work in all rules of Optimizer like `Repartition` and `RepartitionByExpression` did.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test in:\r\n- `NestedColumnAliasingSuite`\r\n- `CollapseRepartitionSuite`\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34815 we change back support unclosed bracketed comment to backend.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut miss the case such as \r\n```\r\nSELECT 1; --comment\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1; /* comment */\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a common use case in sql job. We should ignore the comment at end of SQL script. \r\n\r\nNeed to clarify that when use `-e`, we directly pass SQL to `splitSemiColon`, when use `-f`, CliDriver will add a `\\n` for query.\r\n```\r\n  public int processReader(BufferedReader r) throws IOException {\r\n    StringBuilder qsb = new StringBuilder();\r\n\r\n    String line;\r\n    while((line = r.readLine()) != null) {\r\n      if (!line.startsWith(\"--\")) {\r\n        qsb.append(line + \"\\n\");\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return this.processLine(qsb.toString());\r\n  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo in `splitSemiColon`, we should consider both case.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, the final behavior like below\r\n\r\nFor `-e`\r\n\r\n| Query | Behavior before  | Behavior now|\r\n-------|---------|--------------|\r\n|   `SELECT 1; --comment` |  Will pass both `SELECT 1` and `--comment` to backend engine and throw exception since `--comment` can't be executed| Only pass `SELECT 1` to backend engine and will ignore the simple comment | \r\n|   `SELECT 1;  /* comment */ ` |  Will pass both `SELECT 1` and `/* comment */` to backend engine and throw exception since `/* comment */` can't be executed |  Only pass `SELECT 1` to backend engine|\r\n|   `SELECT 1;  /* comment ` | Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment` to backend engine  |  Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment` to backend engine  | \r\n|   `SELECT 1; /* comment SELECT 1` | Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment SELECT 1` to backend engine  |  Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment SELECT 1` to backend engine  | \r\n|   `/ * comment SELECT 1;`  |  Will pass `/ * comment SELECT 1;` to back end engine and throw `unclose bracketed comment exception`|  Will pass `/ * comment SELECT 1;` to back end engine and throw `unclose bracketed comment exception`| \r\n\r\nFor `-f`, since `-f` will add a `\\n` at the end line if it's not started  as `--`\r\n| Query | Behavior before  | Behavior now|\r\n-------|---------|--------------|\r\n|   `SELECT 1; --comment\\n` |  Will pass both `SELECT 1` and `--comment` to backend engine and throw exception since `--comment` can't be executed| Only pass `SELECT 1` to backend engine and will ignore the simple comment | \r\n|   `SELECT 1;  /* comment */ \\n` |  Will pass both `SELECT 1` and `/* comment */` to backend engine and throw exception since `/* comment */` can't be executed |  Only pass `SELECT 1` to backend engine|\r\n|   `SELECT 1;  /* comment \\n` | Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment\\n` to backend engine  |  Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment\\n` to backend engine  | \r\n|   `SELECT 1; /* comment SELECT 1\\n` | Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment SELECT 1\\n` to backend engine  |  Will pass `SELECT 1` and `/* comment SELECT 1\\n` to backend engine  | \r\n|   `/ * comment SELECT 1;\\n`  |  Will pass `/ * comment SELECT 1;\\n` to back end engine and throw `unclose bracketed comment exception`|  Will pass `/ * comment SELECT 1;\\n` to back end engine and throw `unclose bracketed comment exception`| \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark sql should not pass last entire comment   to backend\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUse can write SQL script end with a comment \r\n```\r\nSELECT 1; --comment\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1; /* comment */\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

Change `addV2TableProperties` of `V1Table`. Just when `external == true`, we will add `location` property.\r\n3. Change `V1Table`.`Schema`, re-construct the original schema from the string.\r\n4. Use V2 command as default for `SHOW CRATE TABLE`\r\n5. Change V2 behavior `ShowTablePartitions` to match V1 behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands, and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nuse V2 command as default for `show create table`\r\nif LEGACY_USE_V1_COMMAND == true\r\nwill use V1 command\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nbuild/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *ShowCreateTableSuite\"\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-14T03:06:16Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T05:22:46Z","closed_at":"2022-01-18T05:22:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55da8e6d390e767e96cae1ef853b23c90db8bf79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7380a5181f7b1b0f696c9836b7f49b39ede432f0","head":{"label":"Peng-Lei:SPARK-37878","ref":"SPARK-37878","sha":"7380a5181f7b1b0f696c9836b7f49b39ede432f0","user":{"login":"Peng-Lei","id":41178002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTc4MDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41178002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei","html_url":"https://github.com/Peng-Lei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":350306448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTAzMDY0NDg=","name":"spark","full_name":"Peng-Lei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Peng-Lei","id":41178002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTc4MDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41178002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei","html_url":"https://github.com/Peng-Lei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peng-Lei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Peng-Lei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR migrates `DROP NAMESPACE` to use V2 command by default. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands, and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe error message will be different if drop database containing tables with RESTRICT mode when v2 command is run against v1 catalog and Hive Catalog:\r\nBefore: `Cannot drop a non-empty database`\r\nvs.\r\nAfter: `Cannot drop a non-empty namespace`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting *DropNamespaceSuite

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSame as the check in `SparkShellLoggingFilter`, `getLevel` cannot be used anymore to check if the log level is set or not for a logger in log4j2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpgrade Netty dependency from 4.1.72 to 4.1.73.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNetty has a new release that upgrades log4j to 2.17.1. Although I didn't find obvious dependence on log4j via netty in my search of Spark's codebase, it would be good to pick up this specific version anyway. The Netty version Spark currently depends on is 4.1.72, which depends on log4j 2.15. Several CVE's have been fixed in log4j between 2.15 and 2.17.1.\r\n\r\nBesides this dependency update, several minor bugfixes have been made in this release, as described [here](https://netty.io/news/2022/01/12/4-1-73-Final.html).\r\n\r\nAssociated JIRA is here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37901\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPasses local tests and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new rule(`EliminateInnerJoin`) to support convert inner join to left semi join. It has two advantages:\r\n1. Statistics are more accurate and more `BroadcastHashJoin`s can be planned.\r\n2. We have 2 other rules(`PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` and `PushLeftSemiLeftAntiThroughJoin`) to optimize left semi join.\r\n\r\nThis is a real case:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t1 using parquet AS SELECT id AS a, id AS b, id AS c FROM range(10000000)\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t2 using parquet AS SELECT id AS a, id AS b, id AS c FROM range(10000000)\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t3 using parquet AS SELECT id AS a, id AS b, id AS c FROM range(1000)\")\r\n\r\nsql(\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n    |SELECT tmp1.*\r\n    |FROM   (SELECT *\r\n    |        FROM   t1\r\n    |        UNION\r\n    |        SELECT *\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a retry of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35179. This PR does the same thing - replacing Actions view to Check run view for `See test results` link.\r\n\r\nThe main difference with the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35179 is that we now keep the Actions run id as is as metadata so this Actions run id can be used to update the status of tests in PRs at Apache Spark:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/85efc85f9aa93b3fac9e591c96efa38d4414adf8/.github/workflows/update_build_status.yml#L63-L74\r\n\r\nNow this PR shouldn't affect [update_build_status.yml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/workflows/update_build_status.yml) which was the main reason of a followup and revert.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor developers to see the test report, and they can easily detect which test is failed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMakes `pandas_udf` to take type annotations with future annotations enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen using `from __future__ import annotations`, the type hints will be all strings, then pandas UDF type inference won't work as follows:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from __future__ import annotations\r\n>>> from typing import Union\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n>>> @pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\n... def plus_one(v: Union[pd.Series, pd.DataFrame]) -> pd.Series:\r\n...     return v + 1\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nNotImplementedError: Unsupported signature: (v: 'Union[pd.Series, pd.DataFrame]') -> 'pd.Series'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Users can use type annotations for pandas UDFs with the future annotations flag.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from __future__ import annotations\r\n>>> from typing import Union\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n>>> @pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\n... def plus_one(v: Union[pd.Series, pd.DataFrame]) -> pd.Series:\r\n...     return v + 1\r\n...\r\n>>> df =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to show the link of Check run view instead of Actions view. Previously, when you add a new custom Check, e.g., [test_report.yml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/workflows/test_report.yml), Actions view also showed this Check.\r\n\r\nNow, seems GitHub Actions changed the behaviour - Actions view always includes the jobs initiated by the specific Workflow e.g., [build_and_test.yml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml) does not include the custom Check added from [test_report.yml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/workflows/test_report.yml).\r\n\r\nTo work around this problem, this PR proposes to show the link of:\r\nCheck run view e.g., https://github.com/apache/spark/runs/4785069876 (\"Report test results\" is included) instead of \r\nActions view e.g., https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/1686013487 (\"Report test results\" is missing) .\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, when developers click the link here:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 10 07 26

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a config to control whether thrift server operations will clear shuffle dependencies eagerly after being executed.\r\n\r\nIn long-running applications, like thrift server, with large driver JVMs, where there is little memory pressure on the driver, the driver gc may happen very occasionally or not at all. Not cleaning at all may lead to executors running out of disk space after a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the thrift server, it currently relies on a periodical system.gc to release shuffle meta/data e.t.c, which is not efficient enough towards its usage scenario as the gc does not always occur immediately. Unclean data may cause thrift server memory issues, like OOM, or disk issues on the work side, like no space left for the device.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nadded new conf\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase.listDirectory`  is used to return the list of files at `path` recursively and the result will skips files that are ignored normally by MapReduce.\r\n\r\nThis method is only used by tests in Spark now and the tests also includes non-parquet test scenario, such as `OrcColumnarBatchReaderSuite`.\r\n\r\nSo this pr move this method from `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` to `TestUtils` to make it as a test method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefactoring: move test method to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `ARM64` architecture in Java 17 docker image for Linux and Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `amd64` is hard-coded.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/371ab5a07c18cc456cc7ee5b8fa051d46e11b363/resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/Dockerfile.java17#L54\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, `JAVA_HOME` is auto-detected in Java 17.\r\n```\r\n$ k logs spark-test-app-bea3e02b0481470b8b13a26cf21f1913\r\n++ id -u\r\n+ myuid=185\r\n++ id -g\r\n+ mygid=0\r\n+ set +e\r\n++ getent passwd 185\r\n+

tested?\r\n\r\nRun on Apple Silicon and Mac. Note that this doesn't mean all tests passed currently. For example, `TestUtils.withHttpServer` doesn't work in M1 environment because `Minikube` is running on `Docker Desktop`.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests \"kubernetes-integration-tests/test\" -Dspark.kubernetes.test.dockerFile=resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/Dockerfile.java17\r\n...\r\n[info] KubernetesSuite:\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with no resources (10 seconds, 601 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with no resources & statefulset allocation (11 seconds, 565 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with a very long application name.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSkip alias the `ExtractValue` whose children contains `NamedLambdaVariable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince #32773, the `NamedLambdaVariable` can produce the references, however it cause the rule `NestedColumnAliasing` alias the `ExtractValue` which contains `NamedLambdaVariable`. It fails since we can not match a `NamedLambdaVariable` to an actual attribute.\r\n\r\nTalk more:\r\nDuring `NamedLambdaVariable#replaceWithAliases`, it uses the references of nestedField to match the output attributes of grandchildren. However `NamedLambdaVariable` is created at analyzer as a virtual attribute, and it is not resolved from the output of children. So we can not get any attribute when use the references of `NamedLambdaVariable` to match the grandchildren's output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

However, there was a limitation of testing it against different Hive versions as outlined in  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35173#discussion_r782644742. This PR proposes to revert `HiveExternalCatalog.withClientWrappingException` and move wrapping logic to `HiveClientImpl`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. To make testing against different Hive versions better.\r\n2. For Hive 0.12, the wrapping logic was not working correctly for `dropDatabase` because the message was not matching.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, for Hive 0.12, the exception message will now be consistent with other versions.\r\nBefore:\r\n`InvalidOperationException(message:Database db is not empty)`\r\nAfter:\r\n`Cannot drop a non-empty database: db. Use CASCADE option to drop a non-empty database`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKeep track of and communicate to the listener bus how long we are waiting for execs to be allocated from the underlying cluster manager.\r\n\r\nReplaces WIP PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34650 \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSometimes the cluster manager may choke or otherwise not be able to allocate resources and we don't have a good way of detecting this situation making it difficult for the user to debug and tell apart from Spark not scaling up correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNew field in the listener bus message for when a executor is allocated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test in the listener

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSkip alias the `ExtractValue` whose children contains `NamedLambdaVariable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince #32773, the `NamedLambdaVariable` can produce the references, however it cause the rule `NestedColumnAliasing` alias the `ExtractValue` which contains `NamedLambdaVariable`. It fails since we can not match a `NamedLambdaVariable` to an actual attribute.\r\n\r\nTalk more:\r\nDuring `NamedLambdaVariable#replaceWithAliases`, it uses the references of nestedField to match the output attributes of grandchildren. However `NamedLambdaVariable` is created at analyzer as a virtual attribute, and it is not resolved from the output of children. So we can not get any attribute when use the references of `NamedLambdaVariable` to match the grandchildren's output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the first child of Union has duplicate columns like select a, a from t1 union select a, b from t2, spark only use the first column to aggregate the results, which would make the results incorrect, and this behavior is inconsistent with other engines like PostgreSQL, MySQL. **We could alias the attribute of the first child of union to resolve this, or you could argue that this is the feature of Spark SQL**.\r\n\r\nsample query:\r\nselect\r\na,\r\na\r\nfrom values (1, 1), (1, 2) as t1(a, b)\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT\r\nc,\r\nd\r\nfrom values (2, 3), (2, 3) as t2(c, d)\r\n\r\nresult is   (1, 1), (1, 1), (3, 3), (3, 3) \r\nexpected (1, 1), (1, 1), (2, 3), (2, 3)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nselect\r\na,\r\na\r\nfrom values (1, 1), (1, 2) as t1(a, b)\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT\r\nc,\r\nd\r\nfrom values (2, 3), (2, 3) as t2(c, d)\r\n\r\nresult is  (1, 1), (2, 2)\r\nexpected

When we union with the first child has duplicate columns, the result would be different.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a checkstyle rule to ban `org.apache.log4j` imports for Java source code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#35077 added a the same rule for scalastyle, it's applied for Scala source code but not for Java one.\r\nCurrently, we don't have Java source code which contains `org.apache.log4j` imports but it's better to be proactive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI manually tested by modifing `ApplicationStatus.java` like as follows and run

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd submitTime for Spark Application\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark Driver may take a long time to startup when running with cluster mode, if YARN temporarily does not have enough resources, or HDFS's performance is poor due to high pressure.\r\n\r\nAfter`submitTime` is added, we can get `submitTIme` from Spark UI or Spark REST API and detect such situation by comparing it with the `spark.app.startTime`(already exists)

to taskInfo.taskId. However, we generally use `index.attempt` or `taskId` to distinguish tasks within a stage, not `taskId.attempt`.\r\nThus #32888 was a wrong fix issue, we should revert it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to throw `SparkRuntimeException` from the AES functions: `aes_encrypt()` and `aes_decrypt()` with the error classes:\r\n- `INVALID_AES_KEY_LENGTH` in the case when the functions get a key of wrong length.\r\n- `UNSUPPORTED_AES_MODE` if the `mode` and `padding` passed to the functions are not supported.\r\n- `AES_CRYPTO_ERROR` when any error occurs during crypto operations.\r\n\r\nNew error classes are added to `error-classes.json`.\r\n\r\nThe tests for checking the errors are moved from `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` to new test suite `QueryExecutionErrorsSuite` .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPorting AES functions to new error framework should improve user experience with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to improve `DataSourceV2Strategy` to be able to push down boolean column filters. Currently boolean column filters do not get pushed down and may cause unnecessary IO.\r\nThis is a follow up PR of the same change for (V1) `DataSourceStrategy`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe following query does not push down the filter in the current implementation\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE boolean_field\r\n```\r\nalthough the following query pushes down the filter as expected.\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE boolean_field = true\r\n```\r\nThis is because the Physical Planner (`DataSourceV2Strategy`) currently only pushes down limited expression patterns like`EqualTo`.\r\nIt is fair for Spark SQL users to expect `boolean_field` performs the same as `boolean_field = true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit

to taskInfo.taskId. However, we generally use `index.attempt` or `taskId` to distinguish tasks within a stage, not `taskId.attempt`.\r\nThus #32888 was a wrong fix issue, we should revert it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe are 2 deprecation compilation warning related to log4j2:\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] [Warn] /spark-source/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/logging/DriverLogger.scala:64: [deprecation @ org.apache.spark.util.logging.DriverLogger.addLogAppender.fa | origin=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.FileAppender.createAppender | version=] method createAppender in class FileAppender is deprecated\r\n[WARNING] [Warn] /spark-source/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkFunSuite.scala:268: [deprecation @ org.apache.spark.SparkFunSuite.LogAppender.<init> | origin=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.AbstractAppender.<init> | version=] constructor AbstractAppender in class AbstractAppender is deprecated\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the above compilation warning, the main change of this pr as follows:\r\n1.  `Log4jFileAppender.Builder` is used instead of `Log4jFileAppender.createAppender` to fix compilation warning of `DriverLogger`, and the configuration of some default values is omitted refer to SPARK-6305. \r\n\r\nThe initial status of `Log4jFileAppender.Builder` as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfileName = null\r\nappend = true\r\nlocking = false\r\nadvertise = false\r\nadvertiseUri = null\r\ncreateOnDemand = false\r\nfilePermissions = null\r\nfileOwner = null\r\nfileGroup = null\r\nbufferedIo = true\r\nbufferSize = 8192\r\nimmediateFlush = true\r\nignoreExceptions = true\r\nlayout = null\r\nname = null\r\nconfiguration = null\r\nfilter = null\r\npropertyArray = null\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we can't use the chained API invocation mode because `AbstractFilterable.Builder.asBuilder()` method will return `Any` in Scala.\r\n \r\n2. Use the recommended constructor of `AbstractAppender` refer to javadoc to fix compilation warning  in `SparkFunSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up deprecation compilation warning related to log4j2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add `LogicalQueryStage(_, agg: BaseAggregateExec)` check in `AQEPropagateEmptyRelation`\r\n- Add `LeafNode` check in `PropagateEmptyRelationBase`, so we can eliminate `LogicalQueryStage` to `LocalRelation`\r\n- Unify the `applyFunc` and `commonApplyFunc` in `PropagateEmptyRelationBase`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe Aggregate in AQE is different with others, the `LogicalQueryStage` looks like `LogicalQueryStage(Aggregate, BaseAggregate)`. We should handle this case specially.\r\n\r\nLogically, if the Aggregate grouping expression is not empty, we can eliminate it safely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd new test in `AdaptiveQueryExecSuite`\r\n- `Support propagate empty relation through aggregate`\r\n- `Support

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add `LogicalQueryStage(_, agg: BaseAggregateExec)` check in `AQEPropagateEmptyRelation`\r\n- Add `LeafNode` check in `PropagateEmptyRelationBase`, so we can eliminate `LogicalQueryStage` to `LocalRelation`\r\n- Unify the `applyFunc` and `commonApplyFunc` in `PropagateEmptyRelationBase`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe Aggregate in AQE is different with others, the `LogicalQueryStage` looks like `LogicalQueryStage(Aggregate, BaseAggregate)`. We should handle this case specially.\r\n\r\nLogically, if the Aggregate grouping expression is not empty, we can eliminate it safely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd new test in `AdaptiveQueryExecSuite`\r\n- `Support propagate empty relation through aggregate`\r\n- `Support
