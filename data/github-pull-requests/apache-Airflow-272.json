For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3787\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nProvide a CLI command to import or export users from a JSON file. The\r\nCLI arguments are modeled after the import/export commands for Variables\r\nand Pools.\r\n\r\nExample Usage:\r\n\r\n    airflow users -i users.json\r\n    airflow users -e /tmp/exported-users.json\r\n\r\nThe import command will create any users that do not yet exist and\r\nupdate any users that already exist. It never deletes users.\r\n\r\nThe format of the file produced by an export is compatible with the\r\nimport command, i.e., `import(export())` should succeed but have no\r\nside-effects.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for both import and export.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3590\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - Change the log message when the executor finishes to clarify that \"success\" or \"failed\" refers to the exit value of the executed script, not the status of the task instance (which may be skipped or up_for_reschedule or up_for_retry).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Only the log message was changed\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-29T20:21:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T21:44:11Z","closed_at":"2019-01-29T21:44:11Z","merged_at":"2019-01-29T21:44:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f688f69cb5f59db888041228dfb4a2ae06e5644","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8efc44ced554bfe9bb331201a14c4c28307b32fc","head":{"label":"seelmann:AIRFLOW-3590-reschedule-log-success","ref":"AIRFLOW-3590-reschedule-log-success","sha":"8efc44ced554bfe9bb331201a14c4c28307b32fc","user":{"login":"seelmann","id":86629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann","html_url":"https://github.com/seelmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0d64fd8aac7b93f4143d8f1d3baa4a0e239aba55","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

is a redo of https://github.com/SiftScience/airflow/pull/1 based on the 1.10.x branch (v1-10-stable)\r\n\r\n**Purpose:**\r\n- https://github.com/SiftScience/code/issues/31076\r\n- XCom data serialization works fine with all API calls except for when writing from the Admin UI. This should fix it (and, in certain ways, clean up the serialization logic in the SQLAlchemy model)\r\n\r\n**Technical overview:**\r\n- The SQLAlchemy model says that the \"data\" field in the `xcom` table is a binary field. It is populated with either a pickled version of an object (legacy mode, but the one we use), or an UTF-8-encoded json string.\r\n- The way this translation happens is by making sure that all the set and get operations go through some transformation function. And that works for most use cases, except for the Admin UI, which uses `flask-admin` and goes directly from the form to the SQLAlchemy model. That means that it tries to write a string into a binary field.\r\n- The actual solution is to not call it a binary field, but some type we control and then provide a serialization/deserialization in the type format itself. This means that we don't have to deal with doing serialization/deserialization in the getters/setters, which have also been removed.\r\n- Also bumped the version to `1.10.2-siftpatch1` which will be used for deployment\r\n\r\n**Testing/deployment plan:**\r\n- Tested with our docker setup and a local PyPI repository and all XCom behavior worked (create, update on UI, push and pull from python)\r\n- Confirmed that it works with a PyPI repository. Just need to set up one (that is not my laptop).\r\n- Tried to run the unit tests, but was unable to do it.","created_at":"2019-01-29T17:28:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T23:48:28Z","closed_at":"2019-01-29T23:48:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"660d7f455a2f945e67c26cd149e58b17102ea874","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8f39d1fd6f4ad8272c9c2f869ddd79d3e5616e08","head":{"label":"SiftScience:mgoldstein_xcom_serialization_fix_1_10","ref":"mgoldstein_xcom_serialization_fix_1_10","sha":"8f39d1fd6f4ad8272c9c2f869ddd79d3e5616e08","user":{"login":"SiftScience","id":836132,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgzNjEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/836132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience","html_url":"https://github.com/SiftScience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":160441176,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjA0NDExNzY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"SiftScience/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SiftScience","id":836132,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgzNjEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/836132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience","html_url":"https://github.com/SiftScience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiftScience/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SiftScience/airflow","description":"Apache

Description\r\n-  The delay between tasks can be a major issue, especially when we have dags with many subdags, \r\n   figures out that the scheduling process spends plenty of time in dependency checking,  we took the \r\n   trigger rule dependency which calls the db for each task instance,  we made it call the db just once for \r\n   each dag_run. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n-  My PR does not

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3749\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen accessing the \"Edit Dag Run\" Page with RBAC enabled you previously got redirected to a 404 Page (/dagmodel/show).\r\n\r\n1.) Now this has been fixed and the url has been changed to point to /dagmodel/edit instead of /dagmodel/show.\r\n2.) It also adds `can_edit` base permission to the `DagModelView` to be able to edit the Dag Run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for both changes:\r\n* the correct url has been generated\r\n* permissions has been granted to edit the Dag Model \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-29T15:06:11Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T11:31:46Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T11:31:46Z","merged_at":"2019-02-11T11:31:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"3041f2fcc227f2f870ed91f73a37a7bfd140b434","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/212a4d93b699ffb7d3c1390d2bafdae5a192cbb5","head":{"label":"feluelle:feature/AIRFLOW-3749-fix-edit-dag-run-page-rbac","ref":"feature/AIRFLOW-3749-fix-edit-dag-run-page-rbac","sha":"212a4d93b699ffb7d3c1390d2bafdae5a192cbb5","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122377019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIzNzcwMTk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feluelle/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses [AIRFLOW-3717](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3717).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial refactor of the documentation examples to use the DAG context manager where appropriate.\r\n\r\nNote that my editor automatically removes unnecessary trailing whitespace, hope that's not a problem.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNo additional tests have been added as it's documentation. I've built the docs locally and manually inspected the changes to ensure no fat-finger errors.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\nThere's a single commit with the subject line referencing the JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThere's no new functionality, so no additional documentation has been added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`. Although strictly speaking, probably not necessary as no new code has been added.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-27T21:34:00Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:44Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f34267c6f514b1f42a4197580dd3aafd9c0ddc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3774\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIt would appear that flask blueprints are not being loaded from plugins. A grep of the entire repo shows flask_blueprints is never read from, and only written into in airflow.plugins_manager.\r\n\r\nI am new to flask, but I am under the assumption, that the blue prints must be passed to a app.register_blueprint(my_blueprint) function to be loaded.\r\n\r\nThis PR registers blueprints with the app at the same point the views from plugins are registered.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-26T22:29:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T19:15:48Z","closed_at":"2019-01-30T19:10:26Z","merged_at":"2019-01-30T19:10:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"82c60a2040a3f306e5f880340c3f646d4f629884","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0b53d701742d45417d7d668d305b1768cbd3de24","head":{"label":"drewsonne:feature/include-blueprints","ref":"feature/include-blueprints","sha":"0b53d701742d45417d7d668d305b1768cbd3de24","user":{"login":"drewsonne","id":233054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne","html_url":"https://github.com/drewsonne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163669353,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM2NjkzNTM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"drewsonne/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"drewsonne","id":233054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne","html_url":"https://github.com/drewsonne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/drewsonne/airflow","description":"Apache

I've created a new\r\nclass for FAB tests and added a test to exercise the `/refresh_all`\r\nendpoint.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2190\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen processing HTTP response headers, gunicorn checks that the name of each\r\nheader is a string. Here's the relevant gunicorn code:\r\n\r\nFrom gunicorn/http/wsgi.py, line 257\r\n\r\n    def process_headers(self, headers):\r\n        for name, value in headers:\r\n            if not isinstance(name, string_types):\r\n                raise TypeError('%r is not a string' % name)\r\n\r\nIn Python3, `string_types` is set to the built-in `str`. For Python 2,\r\nit's set to `basestring`. Again, the relevant gunicorn code:\r\n\r\nFrom gunicorn/six.py, line 38:\r\n\r\n    if PY3:\r\n        string_types = str,\r\n        ...\r\n    else:\r\n        string_types = basestring,\r\n\r\nOn Python2 the `b''` syntax returns a `str`, but in Python3 it returns `bytes`.\r\n`bytes` != `str`, so we get the following error when returning a 404 on\r\nPython3:\r\n\r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/airflow/www/app.py\", line 166, in root_app\r\n    resp(b'404 Not Found', [(b'Content-Type', b'text/plain')])\r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gunicorn/http/wsgi.py\", line 261, in start_response\r\n    self.process_headers(headers)\r\n    File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gunicorn/http/wsgi.py\", line 268, in process_headers\r\n    raise TypeError('%r is not a string' % name)\r\n    TypeError: b'Content-Type' is not a string\r\n\r\nDropping the `b` prefix in favor of the single-quote string syntax should work\r\nfor both Python2 and 3, as demonstrated below:\r\n\r\n    Python 3.7.2 (default, Jan 13 2019, 12:50:15)\r\n    [Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin\r\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n    >>> isinstance('foo', str)\r\n    True\r\n\r\n    Python 2.7.15 (default, Jan 12 2019, 21:43:48)\r\n    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin\r\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n    >>> isinstance('foo', basestring)\r\n    True\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNot sure if there's a clean way to unit test this middleware - open to suggestions. FWIW, I ran the webserver and confirmed that this fixes the issue in AIRFLOW-2190.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-26T18:53:04Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T22:33:44Z","closed_at":"2019-01-27T00:13:44Z","merged_at":"2019-01-27T00:13:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"40f4370324063b05bb60347efe0599582ead313c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/24487b38631ec997895af38e3ca06c05d9ccfa26","head":{"label":"lyft:astahlman/airflow-2190","ref":"astahlman/airflow-2190","sha":"24487b38631ec997895af38e3ca06c05d9ccfa26","user":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58762364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODc2MjM2NA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"lyft/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyft/airflow","description":"Lyft

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3615\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPython 3.5 and 2.7 replace the hostname always with small characters. In the case of a path this is unexpected.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3727\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The timezone section of the documentation (https://airflow.apache.org/timezone.html says) says you can use `timezone.is_aware()` and `timezone.is_naive()` to determine whether date times are aware or naive. However, in the source code, the current method is called `timezone.is_localized().` My changes are to rename all `is_localized` references to `is_aware`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: There are existing unit tests that already test the `timezone.is_localized()` method. After the update, the same unit tests should test against the new `timezone.is_aware()` method name.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-25T21:58:15Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:47Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b3316c3850f08ce116fbf22c8bd3e47515e3752","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

mocked.\r\n\r\nThis switches it to use sphinx.autodoc's built in mocking, and adds\r\nall the modules not installed via `apache-airflow[doc]` that sphinx\r\ncomplained about.\r\n\r\nWith this change

their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x Passes

PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3746)\r\n\r\nswitch from cli.logs to cli.attach to prevent missing container exit\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3746)] \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3746\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) \r\nswitch from cli.logs to cli.attach to prevent missing container exit\r\nWith DockerOperator and using the celery executor, the task runs but never completes. It hungs as \r\ncontainer.logs / certain container hangs.\r\n\r\nsince The contianer.logs() function is a wrapper around container .attach() method, which you can use instead if you want to fetch/stream container output without first retrieving the entire backlog.\r\nSo changing the container.logs() to container.attach() gives the same output and completes the task.\r\nwith the following log.\r\nThe docker_operator Task exited with return code 0\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:All the existing tests are fixed. No new tests are not required.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-24T23:58:37Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T15:00:25Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T15:00:25Z","merged_at":"2019-06-21T15:00:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a328b38a2252ab21692eb73386706ca591a9c1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/888c01ab056cfff42dffcf3d0e387c5fb73f8f61","head":{"label":"ashwiniadiga:AIRFLOW-3746_docker_operator_running_state","ref":"AIRFLOW-3746_docker_operator_running_state","sha":"888c01ab056cfff42dffcf3d0e387c5fb73f8f61","user":{"login":"ashwiniadiga","id":5077227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzcyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwiniadiga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166899554,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjY4OTk1NTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashwiniadiga/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashwiniadiga","id":5077227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzcyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwiniadiga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwiniadiga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashwiniadiga/airflow","description":"Apache

fail, as we are not passing the command to kubernetes as a list item.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: This fixes an issue created with a previous pull request.\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

API from our parent class, but we didn't\r\nsupport it because of the various steps we perform in `get()` - this\r\nmakes it behave more like the parent class, and can simplify a few\r\ninstances in our code (I've only included one that I found here)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: few small tests added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3730\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSome operators did not use the logging mechanism from Airflow, but used the Python mechanism.\r\nSome operators extend the 'LoggingMixin' class when it is not needed.\r\nThis change standardizes these changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nI'm not introducing new changes. Only rewrites the code.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd option to allow logical type conversion when loading to BigQuery. \r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs#configuration.load.useAvroLogicalTypes\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nVery trivial change. Hard to test without integration with BigQuery.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-18T13:08:01Z","updated_at":"2019-03-23T21:55:13Z","closed_at":"2019-03-23T21:52:51Z","merged_at":"2019-03-23T21:52:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe8c9a513d468d230b5cca77535d60f18295f05d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5542f08107a326bc4f258a97d9891c06618b295a","head":{"label":"BrechtDeVlieger:add-avro-logical-types","ref":"add-avro-logical-types","sha":"5542f08107a326bc4f258a97d9891c06618b295a","user":{"login":"BrechtDeVlieger","id":12074972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc0OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12074972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger","html_url":"https://github.com/BrechtDeVlieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159157748,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNTc3NDg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"BrechtDeVlieger/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BrechtDeVlieger","id":12074972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc0OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12074972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger","html_url":"https://github.com/BrechtDeVlieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrechtDeVlieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BrechtDeVlieger/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2955\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix `kubernetes_pod_operator` to set resources requests/limits with a dictionary instead of passing an entire class `Resource()` to the operator. Also add test method `test_pod_resources` for it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: `test_pod_resources`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-18T11:21:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T01:57:34Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T16:47:06Z","merged_at":"2019-05-09T16:47:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"82c7b450e3d360dca3feae556503460f1144266c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/374920ddf659d558a469a5d488dbc463f0cb13b5","head":{"label":"suensummit:AIRFLOW-2955-fix-kubernetes-pod-operator-set-requests-and-limits","ref":"AIRFLOW-2955-fix-kubernetes-pod-operator-set-requests-and-limits","sha":"374920ddf659d558a469a5d488dbc463f0cb13b5","user":{"login":"suensummit","id":5906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit","html_url":"https://github.com/suensummit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166010136,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYwMTAxMzY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"suensummit/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"suensummit","id":5906989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5906989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit","html_url":"https://github.com/suensummit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suensummit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/suensummit/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2843\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n`ExternalTaskSensor` will keep waiting even if the external DAG/task specified doesn't exist at all (this is making sense in some scenarios).\r\n\r\nBut it may be good to provide an option to cease waiting immediately if the external task specified doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\nProvide a flag `check_existence`. Set to `True` to check if the external DAG/task exists, and immediately cease waiting if the external DAG/task does not exist.\r\n\r\n- **Case - 1 Waiting for External DAG**: will check if the DAG exists in DB, AND whether the DAG file exists in file system\r\n- **Case - 2 Waiting for External Task**: the check to do for DAG will happen as well. In addition, re-scan the DAG and check if this task is in the DAG.\r\n\r\n**The default value is set to `False` (no check or ceasing will happen), so it will not affect any existing DAGs or user

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - N/A\r\n  - I am fixing a typo in the documentation and have prepended the commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The exception is thrown based on setting both `execution_delta` and `execution_date_fn`. It would be confusing to see a thrown message claiming different conditions.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Grammatical changes only.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-17T11:06:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T15:21:38Z","closed_at":"2019-01-17T15:21:37Z","merged_at":"2019-01-17T15:21:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad77b17a7532a5483396b2109f5bd10a3d31cc5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cecff51f0d0ae9a6fe0b2d1ce010b5754c2c7d13","head":{"label":"dlamblin:AIRFLOW-XXX]-ExternalTaskSensor-typo","ref":"AIRFLOW-XXX]-ExternalTaskSensor-typo","sha":"cecff51f0d0ae9a6fe0b2d1ce010b5754c2c7d13","user":{"login":"dlamblin","id":4128491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjg0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4128491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin","html_url":"https://github.com/dlamblin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166208600,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYyMDg2MDA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"dlamblin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dlamblin","id":4128491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjg0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4128491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin","html_url":"https://github.com/dlamblin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamblin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dlamblin/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3629\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThose four abstract methods in Base Hook are removed:\r\n\r\nget_conn()\r\nget_records()\r\nget_pandas_df()\r\nrun(sql)\r\n\r\nThose methods being abstract (raising NotImplementedError) in\r\nBaseHook are not needed.\r\n\r\nThey generate warnings in smart IDEs\r\n(such as Pycharm/IntelliJ) but they bring no value. Not all hooks\r\nare supposed to implement them. Seems that only hooks that have a\r\nDB-hook-like behaviour implement most of the methods.\r\n\r\nHaving abstract DB class with those methods and having relevant\r\nclasses to inherit from them seems to make much more sense.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR  does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new functionality. Existing tests should test it all :).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nNo new functionality\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T16:21:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T09:57:47Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T23:51:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d6c393f972ce546d8ba395ee68bb322dc0f0fab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4538/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4538/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4538/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9395cd0b37dadc4620716b0f91919c620c02db13","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:AIRFLOW-3629-abstract-base-hook-meethods-removed","ref":"AIRFLOW-3629-abstract-base-hook-meethods-removed","sha":"9395cd0b37dadc4620716b0f91919c620c02db13","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/

commit adds support for Automated execution of Unit Tests and\r\n(what is more important) System Tests using Google Cloud Build.\r\n\r\nIts likely that this commit will be merged with some changes providing\r\nthat the supporting docker image that is used for Cloud Build\r\ncomes from an external repository. The ultimate goal is to\r\nhave an image that supports both Travis CI and Google Cloud Build at\r\nthe same time and it should be part of the Airflow repository itself.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-594\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-594\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-594\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n  This PR is a precursor to loading DAGs from pip packages. It provides a new plugin structure, `AirflowPluginDagSource` with two methods `collect_dags_from_plugins` and `put_dag_plugins_on_disk` where a Plugin author can:\r\n -  implement the former and provide logic to inject the `airflow.model.DAG` objects into a provided `airflow.modal.DagBag` object using their own custom logic,\r\n - or implement the latter and provide logic to write the dag python files to disk in the dag folder where they will be collected by the normal DAG loading setup.\r\n\r\nFrom discussion below, potential use cases could be:\r\n - to load dags from pip packages\r\n - to load dags from (for example) S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage (using the built in hooks/connections);\r\n - integration with say, https://github.com/wooga/airconditioner without mixing yaml and python for dag definitions;\r\n - tighter integration with https://github.com/python-bonobo/bonobo\r\n - as an intermediary step to handle some automatic lineage injection on DAG load\r\n - perform some validation or linting of DAGs before loading.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

checks for an attribute named `autocommit`.\r\n\r\nSince `pymssql` Connection object actually has a method with that name, it returns a bound method when fetching an attribute with that name, evaluating to a \"truthy\" value. It resulted in SQL statements not actually being committed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNo tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nNo new functionality\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes
