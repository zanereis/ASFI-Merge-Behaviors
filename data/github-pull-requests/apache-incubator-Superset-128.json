Adding a file `/explore/controlPanels/Shared_BigNumber.js` that applies to both of these exports in this plugin package. I plan to follow this same approach for controls that are shared among multiple exports from one plugin, e.g. DeckGL or NVD3... just to keep things a _little_ more DRY.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently when clicking on \"Explore\" button in SQL Lab results, it defaults the time range to \"100 years ago : infinity\", which is basically equivalent to no filter for most datasources. However, it has implication on how the x-axis will be plotted in certain charts (e.g., recently, the Big Number chart introduced a[ fixed range](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9341) option).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default to \"No filter\" so the time range filter can be more properly utilized. \r\n\r\nThere is also a global default value \"[Last week](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/893c95521b8147cce85eafade9f718867990ff75/superset-frontend/src/explore/controls.jsx#L846)\", which is applied when users create a new chart from `/chart/add`. We are not changing this default value in this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on Explore in SQL Lab:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/78172759-75eab600-740b-11ea-840a-1e2389b6c925.png)\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/78172730-69665d80-740b-11ea-924d-ee7bcec67b7d.png)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/78172938-c4985000-740b-11ea-96c3-d13e69c14d94.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the `/api/v1/query` endpoint doesn't support post-SQL data processing. This functionality is necessary for decoupling the backend from the frontend, as many of the data operations necessary for advanced visualizations often require data processing either not readily available in SQL, the JavaScript ecosystem, or are unfeasible due to network/computational expense.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds post-query data processing functionality to Superset necessary for deprecating `viz.py`, namely\r\n- `aggregate` (same as SQL `GROUP BY`)\r\n- `pivot` (grouping by into column values and aggregation by cell value)\r\n- `sort` (same as `ORDER BY`)\r\n- `rolling` (e.g. moving sums, averages)\r\n\r\nThis is done by leveraging functionality readily available in Pandas and Numpy. To leverage this functionality, post processing operations can be defined as part of the `queries` attribute in the `QueryContext` object. Below is an example from the unit tests, where the mean and 1st quantile are computed on an already aggregated query, which is lastly sorted by the 1st quantile value (descending) and state (ascending by default):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"queries\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"granularity\": \"ds\",\r\n            \"groupby\": [\"name\", \"state\"],\r\n            \"metrics\": [{\"label\": \"sum__num\"}],\r\n            \"filters\": [],\r\n            \"row_limit\": 100,\r\n            \"post_processing\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"operation\": \"aggregate\",\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"groupby\": [\"state\"],\r\n                        \"aggregates\": {\r\n                            \"q1\": {\r\n                                \"operator\": \"percentile\",\r\n                                \"column\": \"sum__num\",\r\n                                \"options\": {\"q\": 25},\r\n                            },\r\n                            \"median\": {\r\n                                \"operator\": \"median\",\r\n                                \"column\": \"sum__num\",\r\n                            },\r\n                        },\r\n                    },\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"operation\": \"sort\",\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"by\": [\"q1\", \"state\"],\r\n                        \"ascending\": {\"q1\": False},\r\n                    },\r\n                },\r\n            ],\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature should be seen as experimental at this stage. Furthermore, additional unit tests and documentation will be added later, probably in the form of OpenAPI specs.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + local tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

possible.\r\nIn presto, credentials are authenticated against a 'principal', that principal can then impersonate a 'user' so queries can be executed with authorisation rules applied to the user (not the principal).\r\nBenefit: a single shared presto data source can be created in superset with a generic account (superuser aka the principal) in the presto connection. Then each user that logs into superset ui does not need to create new datasource, they can go straight to SQLLab and run presto queries on the shared datasource which are being authorised under their username.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-30T23:45:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T12:06:51Z","closed_at":"2020-08-08T07:26:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d209969a75a7d1b153815e7bc692ce294f3c721f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":238899554,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg4OTk1NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/inactive","name":"inactive","color":"14351C","default":false,"description":"Inactive

] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIssue #9404 \r\n\r\nBy default, the impersonation on Superset for SQL Server connections is done by replacing the user of the connection string by the logged in user name. This was not the behaviour we were expecting at DefinedCrowd. We want to have an application user capable of impersonating the logged in user.\r\n\r\nThe solution I'm proposing is to use the mssql+pymssql SQLAlchemy adapter you already support and use the conn_properties query parameter, which allows us to send SQL queries to the server upon the connection establishment. This query would be EXECUTE AS USER = '<USER_TO_IMPERSONATE>', which will run all the following queries as the logged in user.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n####Exploratory test\r\n\r\n1. Create a database user for your logged in user. They **must** share the same username;\r\n\r\n2. Create an application user on a SQL Server database. This user must be granted\r\nwith the `IMPERSONATE` permission as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGRANT IMPERSONATE ON USER::[<USER_TO_IMPERSONATE>] TO <APPLICATION_USER>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. On Superset UI, create a new database source with a connection with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmssql+pymssql://<username>:<password>@<server>:<port>/<database_name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Enable the `Impersonate the logged on user` flag;\r\n\r\n5. Run the query `SELECT CURRENT_USER as username;` on SQL Lab;\r\n\r\n6. The expected output should be your logged in user and not the application one.\r\n\r\n####Unit test\r\n\r\nIf you think this feature would be useful for community, I will invest time on this kind of tests.","created_at":"2020-03-27T12:06:40Z","updated_at":"2020-07-18T14:22:42Z","closed_at":"2020-07-18T14:22:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb678909108a55ee3ef4863ff3e92e145a43bbcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":238899554,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg4OTk1NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/inactive","name":"inactive","color":"14351C","default":false,"description":"Inactive

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis adds support for specifying SSL certificates on a per database basis.  This is done by adding a new field `server_cert` to the `dbs` table and using that in the `pydruid.connect()` call. Unfortunately Python doesn't yet support passing certificates either as strings or file-like objects (see the [PR](https://bugs.python.org/issue16487) that has been 8 years in the making and the stalled [PEP-543](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0543/)), hence the certificate has to be persisted to disk ‚òπÔ∏è To avoid rewriting the certificate to disk every time it is used, the file path is made deterministic by naming it with the md5 of the certificate contents and only written to disk if it doesn't yet exist in the designated path. Unit tests have also been added to verify that only valid certificates are persisted to disk.\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhilst testing some caching logic I realized that for some slices the cache key was different between the `/superset/warm_up_cache/?slice_id=<id>`  and `/superset/slice/<id>/` endpoints. \r\n\r\nThe reasons being is that the `time_grain_sqla` (SQL) and `grainularity` (Druid NoSQL) fields are now optional for a number of visualization types and the frontend removes any erroneous fields which are not defined by the chart controls resulting in inconsistent form data. \r\n\r\nFor reference I introduced these regressions via the following PRs:\r\n\r\n-  https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8674\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8764\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8800\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8825 \r\n\r\nThis PR: \r\n\r\n1. Adds a migration to clean up erroneous `time_grain_sqla` (SQL) and `grainularity` (Druid NoSQL) fields in saved slice parameters. \r\n2. Encodes `time_grain_sqla` form-data as `None` as opposed to `\"\"` for consistency. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTested locally (using both `db upgrade` and `db downgrade`) and confirmed that the cache keys were identical. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere is currently an issue affecting dashboards using tabs layout where if the content of a tab row occupies the entire row it's very difficult to insert components between rows. Since there is no area where the row is exposed the only way to target a drag and drop on the row is to have the mouse hover over the 1px row border. Even then it can be quite tricky to activate the drag and drop on the row. This issue is only present in tabs since the grid layout includes a margin between rows.\r\n\r\n This PR fixes the issue by adding some padding to the row when in edit dashboard mode. By exposing a 16px region, instead of 1px, it's easier to move the cursor over the row and activate the row as a target for the drop. There is a small visual change to the layout (spacing between rows) however it's only present when in edit mode. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\ncreate a dashboard using tab layout with multiple rows. Adjust content of each of the rows so that the content fills the entire row. \r\n- can easily insert a new row between existing rows. \r\n- can easily drag a chart and insert it between new rows, thus creating a new row. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_PROCESSOR config to allow customizing macros template processors for various database engine. A good example of usage is to support processor that treats $MACRO as macro, as opposed to {{ JINJIA_TEMPLATE }}. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhilst looking into the chart caching logic I got tripped up on a few issues specifically: \r\n\r\n1. There were two `get_viz` methods which were near identical and `views.utils.get_viz` and `views.core.Superset:get_viz` and only the former was being used. \r\n2. These methods where not forcing a new query if the `slice_id` was defined, i.e., \r\n\r\n```python\r\n if slice_id:\t\r\n    slc = db.session.query(Slice).filter_by(id=slice_id).one()\t\r\n    return slc.get_viz()\r\n```\r\n\r\none would expect the last line to read `return slc.get_viz(force=force)`. Upon further investigation it seems like the only place that was calling the `get_viz` method with the `slice_id` argument was the obsolete `/slice_query/<slice_id>/` route (I checked it wasn't being used in [superset-ui](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/search?q=slice_query&unscoped_q=slice_query) repo as well) and thus jettisoned  the endpoint and the `models.slices.Slice:get_viz` method. \r\n\r\n3. The statsD logging for `loaded_from_source` (which is useful for determining the cache hit rate, i.e., `loaded_from_cache` / (`loaded_from_cache` + `loaded_from_source`) was agnostic of whether the it was loaded because of force load and thus the denominator is over counting. Ideally an `is_force` tag would be beneficial however statsD doesn't support these (Datadog does though) and thus I updated the logic to only increment the `loaded_from_source` counter if it is not forced. The other option is to leave the logic unchanged and add a `loaded_from_cache_non_forced` (or similar) counter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

and then mouseup, the modal closes. This is irritating when trying to edit text inside a modal, as you'll often drag the mouse out of bounds when selecting text. The bug was fixed in react-bootstrap v0.33.\r\n\r\nMigrating to 0.33 means dealing with some breaking changes, in spite of being a \"minor\" version. I've done a thorough search and fixed all that I could find (mostly to do with changes to the `<Panel>` contract.\r\n\r\nI also ended up fixing a few instances where propTypes were incorrectly defined.\r\n\r\nAs much as I would like to upgrade to react-bootstrap v1.0, that proved too daunting a task for now, with many breaking changes. Perhaps this work can bring us closer to that point.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently `query_obj` includes both `groupby` and `columns` which are mutually exclusive in a `SELECT` statement: if a metric is present, you have to use `GROUP BY`, and if you are grouping, you can't have ungrouped columns/expressions. Currently having the option to define both simultaneously is both confusing and causes unnecessary complexity in some viz', and are sometimes used interchangeably, adding unnecessary complexity to the development and maintenance workflow. \r\n\r\nTo simplify the query object and viz controls, it makes sense to group these together and always perform grouping if at least one metric is present. In addition, viz-specific selectable fields such as `series`, `entity`, `all_columns` are deprecated, and are expected to be passed to the query API in a single array `columns`. A deprecation notice is added for all legacy columns. Below is a screenshot of the log generated when opening the DeckGL example dashboard:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/77935763-90614a00-72ba-11ea-9185-b8ffa2e8d94f.png)\r\n\r\nMaking this change will make it easier to decouple the backend from the viz plugins, as the backend won't need to have a translation layer that understands the context in which a control is being used, e.g. that `entity` should be used as a grouping column. It will also make it easier to introduce pre-aggregated metrics, something the current workflow doesn't support.\r\n\r\nThis change will not require a migration of viz metadata, as control ids will stay unchanged. However, to get rid of the deprecation warnings, viz plugins will need to perform grouping of column controls prior to submitting a request. For example, the values contained in `series` and `entities` will need be added to the array `columns` in the request payload.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerify that all example dashboards work +

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIt appears that **get_rls_filters()** func have the following SELECT statement issue:\r\nThe **filter_roles** subquery should select **rls_filter_id** (corresponding to existing **role_id**) instead of selecting the **id** of (role_id, rls_filter_id) pair. This way the proper filters can then be selected from **row_level_security_filters** table.\r\n\r\nThe query in **get_rls_filters()** should look as follows:\r\n\r\nSELECT row_level_security_filters.id AS row_level_security_filters_id, row_level_security_filters.clause AS row_level_security_filters_clause \r\nFROM row_level_security_filters \r\nWHERE row_level_security_filters.table_id = %(table_id_1)s AND row_level_security_filters.id IN (SELECT rls_filter_roles.**rls_filter_id** \r\nFROM rls_filter_roles \r\nWHERE rls_filter_roles.role_id IN (SELECT ab_user_role.role_id \r\nFROM ab_user_role \r\nWHERE ab_user_role.user_id = %(user_id_1)s))\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

the `isFloat` prop set, you can't actually _type_ a decimal point. This is because when that prop is set, a `parseFloat` strips the decimal place off. This teensy PR just looks to see if the value ends in a decimal place. If so, it lets it slide through. If not, it runs the `parseFloat`. The value already went through a check to see if the value is numeric, so you can't type junk like `1.1.1` or something. There may still be edge cases around spaces or something, but at least this allows the user to type a decimal number.\r\n\r\nAs a repro case, you can empty the Treemap's \"Ratio\" input and the try to type a decimal number.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Big Number chart has two problems related to the handling of null values:\r\n\r\n1. **Misleading time range**: When there is no data at the beginning or ending periods of the filtered time range, the backend returns no data records for those periods, therefore the trend line will only start rendering from the datetime where there is data. This often leads to confusion or misinterpretations, especially then in the dashboards that have multiple trend line charts filtered to the same time range. They could all be showing similar smooth lines, yet representing very different time ranges.\r\n2. **NULL value at the last record**: When the last record returns NULL value for the metric, the Big Number text will render as \"No data\", but the trend line still renders. Some users have requested to fallback displaying the Big Number with the last available dates.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds option `timeRangeFixed` to fix the first problem and adds a \"fallback to last available value\" behavior to address the second problem.\r\n\r\nThe `timeRangedFixed` option is disabled by default. When enabled, the empty starting and ending periods will take space on the x-axis, but there will be no connected lines, dots, or tooltips, just as if the metric values are NULL.\r\n\r\nIn case the last record has a NULL value for the metric, we will go back to the last available value and display it in grayed out style (see screen shots below).\r\n\r\nThe Flask API (`viz.py` is updated to return `query.from_dttm` and `query.to_dttm` for identifying time ranges.\r\n\r\nThe PR also updates how dates in tooltips are rendered. It will now render tooltips more rigidly by using the specified Time Grain, instead of guessing the granularity from the timestamp itself, which often fails to deal with quarters, e.g. a quarterly floored timestamp 2010-01-01 00:00:00 would be rendered as \"2010\", and 2010-04-01 00:00:00 rendered as \"Apr 2010\". They will now be rendered as \"2010 Q1\" and \"2010 Q2\" respectively. Note for Time Grain = month, \"Apr 2010\" will also be rendered as \"2010-04\" to be more i18n friendly. We should prefer more universal time formatting until we find a way to set locales for `d3-format`.\r\n\r\nWill have to wait for https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/pull/403 to be merged and published.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nThis is a query against this data source:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-01-01' as date, NULL as value\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-02-01' as date, 5 as value\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-03-01' as date, NULL  as value\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-04-01' as date, 3  as value\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-05-01' as date, 9  as value\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT TIMESTAMP '2019-06-01' as date, NULL as value\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/77221807-4d5ce500-6b0a-11ea-93c4-529d2698d5ad.png)\r\n\r\n1. If the latest record is NULL, it will not fallback to last available datetime.\r\n2. Even though the Time filter specified \"Last year\", it only shows a couple of months (till June 2019) we had data (even though June 2019 is null).\r\n\r\nThis query is incorporated in the dashboard below as \"Sample Series\":\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/77504560-ec8d1f80-6e1d-11ea-966b-deefde9706b0.png)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nIt will now fallback to the last available value and show a warning:\r\n![Snip20200325_15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/77595656-0464b200-6eb7-11ea-87e1-4b8c0d7c68f0.png)\r\n\r\nThe default font size is also increased to make the numbers even more noticeable (this has no effect on existing charts).\r\n\r\nFor the behavior about `timeRangeFixed`, check https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/pull/403 \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Save above SQL query in SQL Lab\r\n2. Explore the data and change visualization type to \"Big Number with Trendline\"\r\n3. Play with the date ranges and the new options and make sure everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/pull/403\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new

explore from a dashboard context, the current\r\ndashboard filter(s) are passed along to explore so that the context is\r\nkept. So say you're filtering on \"country=Romania\", in your dashboard\r\nand pivot to explore, that filter is still there and keep on exploring.\r\n\r\nNow a common issue is that you'll want to make some tweak to your chart\r\nthat are unrelated to the filter, say toggling the legend off for\r\ninstance, and then save it. Now you back to your dashboard and even\r\nthough you started with an \"all countries\" dashboard, with a global\r\nfilter on country, now that one chart is stuck on \"Romania\". Typically\r\nyou notice this when filtering on something else, say \"Italy\" and then\r\nthat one chart now has two mutually exclusive filters, and show \"No data\".\r\n\r\nNow, the fix is to flag the filter as \"extra\" (that's the not-so-good internal\r\nname we use for these inherited filters) and make it clear that that\r\nspecific filter is special and won't be saved when saving the chart.\r\n\r\n### CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe owners input on the Properties modals for charts+dashboards currently makes one request for all the

This doesn't work on installations with hundreds of users, due to API response limits. This PR loads owner options on each keystroke so you can search for users.\r\n\r\nI used `react-select`'s async functionality, which also caches results to reduce api calls.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis updates how `wepback-dev-server` proxy reads asset manifest. Instead of reading from the generated `manifest.json` file, we use webpack hooks.\r\n\r\nThis is needed because sometimes proxy server will read `manifest.json` before it is fully updated, resulting the proxy to return the old code for an updated module on a hard page refresh.\r\n\r\nAlso added some docs for how to edit plugins as a followup to https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9326 . \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nBefore the change:\r\n\r\n- Start the dev server, go to

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes Webpack / Babel / TypeScript configs to make local build with `webpack-dev-server` and `npm link` less error-prone. It fixes tones of potential pitfalls that are currently breaking the build process. See details in code comments.\r\n\r\nBuilding with source code (including TypeScript) should now work for most visualization plugins out of the box with a simple `npm link` command ([all official plugins](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins) have been tested working):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd incubator-superset/superset-frontend\r\nnpm link ~/path/to/superset-ui-plugins/packages/plugin-name\r\nnpm run dev-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dev server will automatically use `./node_modules/@superset-ui/plugin-name/src` to resolve `import \"@superset-ui/plugin-name\"`, if the `src` folder exists (normally only when the npm package `@superset-ui/plugin-name` is linked to the source code repo via `npm link`).\r\n\r\nTo link all plugins, just do:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm link ~/path/to/superset-ui-plugins/packages/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo unlink, just run `npm install` again. Relinking is as simple as hitting `Ctr + R` in Bash/ZSH:\r\n\r\n![Snip20200318_66](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/77043600-1c01df00-697b-11ea-94f7-6426dc33a9f8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote this PR also solves some of the problems mentioned in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8638 (e.g., to eliminate the need to manually edit plugin path in `MainPreset.js` by automatically resolving symlinked plugin packages to `<plugin-name>/src`).\r\n\r\n#### Limitation\r\n\r\nThere is still some issues with the process that is preventing hot-reload to work on Chart plugins (probably a bug or misconfiguration related to react-hot-loader or how `Superchart` renders a `viz_type` dynamically). The code will successfully build, but the visualization will not rerender (_still can't figure out why..._). The remedy is to edit [superset-frontend/src/chart/Chart.jsx](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/8bc30da6211df67ee8bec21e160ce587817ba85b/superset-frontend/src/chart/Chart.jsx#L193) after editing the plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR also upgrades following packages:\r\n\r\n- react\r\n- react-dom\r\n- react-hot-loader\r\n- @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining (new)\r\n- @hot-loader/react-dom (new)\r\n- jest\r\n- @types/react\r\n- @types/react-dom\r\n- ts-jest\r\n- ts-loader\r\n- tslib\r\n- typescript\r\n- webpack-assets-manifest\r\n- webpack-cli\r\n- webpack-dev-server\r\n- webpack-sources\r\n\r\nI figure it's just easier to upgrade everything to the latest version other than chasing down a potential bug that may have been fixed in later versions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nWhen running `npm run dev-server`, there will be a notice on which plugins are now using symlink to its source.\r\n\r\n![Snip20200318_69](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/77028545-48573480-6956-11ea-8d31-ebd7f5a14661.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. `npm link` a plugin, either by the commands presented above or follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/docs/debugging.md). Make sure you have run `yarn && yarn build` in the plugin repo after checking it out.\r\n2. Start the Python backend and the webpack-dev-server: `npm run dev-server`\r\n3. The build should be successful and should have used your updated source code in `packages/plugin-name/src`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:\r\n   - #8638 \r\n   -

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nTrying to use dynamic loading to pull in plugins. This seems to work fine with using the npm packages as you see in this code. However, if you switch the package name to a relative path pointing at the plugins /src folder, webpack *tries* to load it but chokes due to not applying the right loaders. Not quite sure what to do with it at this point.\r\n\r\nAlso note that for this to work, there will be a prerequisite change in `superset-ui` since dynamic imports return promises. In `Preset.ts` you need to change:\r\n```\r\n    this.plugins.forEach(plugin => {\r\n      plugin.register();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n    this.plugins.forEach(plugin => {\r\n      if(plugin instanceof Promise) plugin.then(res => res.register())\r\n      else plugin.register();\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nthen:\r\n* `cd` into `/superset-ui/` and `yarn build`\r\n* `cd` into `/superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-core` and `npm link`\r\n* `cd` into `incubator-superset/superset-frontend` and hit`npm link @superset-ui/core`\r\n* (re)start your `npm dev` server as normal.\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@suddjian @kristw It sure seems like this ALMOST works, but is apparently beyond my webpack knowhow. If you think we can get webpack loaders to somehow process the contents of the `/src` folders of plugins, this might make things a LOT easier than dealing with `npm

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently `SupersetResultSet` is unable to handle results that are coming in as a list of lists. This causes trouble later when converting the result into a numpy array. While the convention for PEP-249 is to return a list of tuples, this is not strictly enforced, and hence many connectors return a list of lists.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the result set is a list of tuples that numpy can handle properly. A test case is also added that fails without the change.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/76957017-b8959400-691d-11ea-85b7-95c6e3690e97.png)\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIt is common for SQL engines to offer the option to define a custom character set and collation scheme for columns. The convention is to define this using the following syntax (example from MySQL): `VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET LATIN1 COLLATE UTF8MB4_GENERAL_CI`. A few examples:\r\n- https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-column.html\r\n- https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-5.1-en/charset-column.html\r\n\r\nCurrently Superset already removes collation info, but retains the character set info. This often causes an overflow when saving metadata due to the column type only being 32 characters wide. This PR makes removal of collation and character set info the new default behaviour.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal test + CI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: closes

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSuperset offers a couple of ways to warm_up cache:\r\n\r\n- cache warm_up endpoint:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/8764ae385206c8bdccba1e7aa42def1929f6fba7/superset/views/core.py#L1645\r\n- Celery task: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/000a038af193f2770dfe23a053bd1ff5e9e72bd4/superset/tasks/cache.py#L257\r\n\r\nSuperset will generate a query like `form_data={slice_id: _slice_id_}` so that we can warm_up query saved with a given slice_id. \r\n\r\nNow a lot dashboard are having default filters (and filters can have scopes), warm_up single slice without dashboard context make our cache hit rate declining. Currently in airbnb we have 10% dashboard with default filters, but 20% of dashboards are landed with default_filters.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add dashboard context into the cache warm_up call. You can pass extra dashboard_id parameter to `wam_up` API, indicating the slice is called with a given dashboard. It should generate a query like \r\n\r\n```\r\nform_data = {\"slice_id\":926, \"extra_filters\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"col\": \"region\",\r\n      \"op\": \"in\",\r\n      \"val\": [\r\n        \"East Asia & Pacific\",\r\n        \"Latin America & Caribbean\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nadded new unit tests\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @serenajiang @etr2460

This is currently at odds with `setup.py`, which requires `click<7.0.0`. This PR bumps click to the latest version, which seems to work well with Superset.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested locally + CI\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOne of the main pain points in developing Superset frontend features is the lack of testing data. Local installations often do not have enough examples conveniently set up to test different edge cases. Because of the multi-repo workflow with chart plugins, it also get complicated to set up an editable frontend building environment on remote servers.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows `webpack-dev-server` to proxy to any remote Superset web service, but at the same time replaces CSS/JS asset references in the response HTML with locally built chunk files that have source map and hot reload support. The remote Superset service must be running on a version later than this PR.\r\n\r\nThis allows developers to start the frontend server locally, but test with production/staging data served by a remote server. This setup makes it easier to debug edge cases all while maintaining the productivity of writing code in a local IDE.\r\n\r\nThe only caveat is that this solution may not work for some complex user authentication configurations that require OAuth callbacks or cross-domain redirects. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nUsing following command to proxy dev-server to a remote Superset service:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run dev-server --superset=http://superset.dev.example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr use a local reverse proxy or SSH port forwarding to forward remote service to`http://localhost:8088`.\r\n\r\nThe page should load normally with locally built assets and JS hot reloading should work.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL
