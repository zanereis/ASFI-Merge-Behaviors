#26995, and to fix the countries_custom/france_regions.geojson added in #25676,\r\nI propose to generate france_regions.geojson from the data provided department-wise by Natural Earth Data\r\nbut that can be merged together into their parent division, i.e. regions.\r\nThe [geopandas dissolve](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/aggregation_with_dissolve.html) function can do just that and the mapping departments=>regions comes from the [ISO 3166-2 FR norm](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:FR)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe previous france_regions.geojson ,while it was generated from a solid source (IGN BD TOPO), is large (12MB) compared to other files and provided in the incorrect projection (EPSG 2154 instead of EPSG 4326 / WGS 84), resulting in a buggy display in Superset while using the Country Map plugin.\r\n\r\nAll files from Natural Earth Data are provided with the EPSG 4326 / WSG 84 ([source](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/)) and it is the projection understood by the Country Map plugin as its current implementation.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nIn the notebook\r\n<img width=\"457\" alt=\"notebook\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen the PoP KPI chart is rendered in a dashboard and the dashboard has a time range filter, this filter is making the chart useless because it's overriding both queries thus no comparison is happening.\r\n\r\nAlso, previously if the bigNumber or the prev Number were zero, the % change would be zero when it should have been 100%.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

Superset UI styling extension framework #27011\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCustomizing Buttons and Navigation in Superset through Theming\r\n \r\nSuperset has allowed limited UI customization via the THEME_OVERRIDES configuration. This exposes only font and colour changes for certain elements like buttons and navigation links.\r\n \r\nThis approach has some drawbacks:\r\n‚Ä¢\tStyles are restricted to typography and colours only. Properties like borders, shadows, opacity and more remain inaccessible.\r\n‚Ä¢\tIdentical HTML attributes for semantic elements make selective styling difficult. The \"Create Dashboard\" primary call-to-action button uses the same classes as secondary \"Bulk Action\" buttons.\r\n‚Ä¢\tClasses and selectors for customization are not clearly documented.\r\n\r\nTo address this, theming capabilities have been enhanced significantly:\r\n‚Ä¢\tA new theme file can override styles for most UI elements based on class names, HTML tags and component hierarchy. Examples now exist for styling specific buttons, dropdowns, tables and more.\r\n‚Ä¢\tFull access to modify colours, fonts, spacing, borders, shadows and more for targeted elements.\r\n‚Ä¢\tImproved documentation for Superset's React hierarchy and class names to simplify theme crafting.\r\n \r\nThis grants administrators more flexibility in customizing branding aesthetics, tweaking interactions, enhancing readability and ensuring accessibility needs without wrestling overrides at a component level.\r\n \r\nThe updated theming system aims to balance standardization that aids rapid development with customization pathways vital for diverse dashboard consumers. \r\n \r\n### Apache Superset‚Äôs extension to customize Superset's Appearance with Theming:\r\nThis extension allows administrators to customize various aspects of the superset UI appearance without needing to override React components.\r\n \r\n### What Can Be Customized?\r\nThe theming file `theme.less` allows changing colors, typography, borders, shadows, and more for elements like:\r\n \r\n- Buttons\r\n- Links\r\n- Input fields\r\n- Select dropdowns\r\n- Menu items\r\n- Tab navigation\r\n- Tables\r\n- Modals\r\n- Loaders\r\n- Toasts\r\n \r\nAnd more based on their HTML tags, CSS classes and attributes.\r\n \r\n### How Theming Works?\r\n‚Ä¢\tDefining Styles: This involves specifying the visual properties of various elements such as text, buttons, backgrounds, etc. Styles can include attributes like colors, fonts, borders, and more.\r\nFor example:\r\n // Color mixins\r\n.setColor(@name, @color: black) {\r\n.bg-@{name} {\r\nbackground-color: @color !important;\r\n  \t}\r\n.text-@{name} {\r\ncolor: @color !important;\r\n}\r\n.border-@{name} {\r\nborder-color: @color !important;\r\n}\r\n.placeholder-@{name} {\r\nborder-color: @color !important;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tCreating Theme Files: Theme files contain the style definitions and are often separate from the core application code. This separation allows for easier maintenance and updates.\r\nFor example:\r\n// Primary button theme\r\n.btn-primary {\r\n.bg-blue-600;\r\n.border-blue-600;\r\n}\r\n \r\n// Input theme\r\ninput.form-control {\r\n.font-sans;\r\n.bg-white;\r\n.border;\r\n.border-gray-600;\r\n.placeholder-gray-600;\r\n.text-sm;\r\n.text-gray-800;\r\n}\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tImporting Themes: This process involves loading the appropriate theme files and applying the defined styles.\r\nImport theme.less file in <superset>/superset-frontend/src/theme.ts file.\r\n// Importing custom theme.\r\nimport './assets/stylesheets/custom/theme.less';\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tRestart Superset server to apply the defined styles\r\n \r\n### Benefits\r\n-\tenhances the user experience by providing a personalized and visually appealing interface\r\n-\tGranular control over many UI elements without editing components\r\n-\tChange colours, typography, padding, borders, shadows and more\r\n-\tApply organization branding and themes\r\n \r\n### Enabling custom theme in the application\r\n‚Ä¢\tImport theme.less file in <superset>/superset-frontend/src/theme.ts file.\r\n// Importing custom theme.\r\nimport './assets/stylesheets/custom/theme.less';\r\n\r\nTo enable custom loading indicator in the application\r\n‚Ä¢\tChange the Loader image path from src/assets/images/loading.gif to src/assets/images/custom/loading.gif in the following files:\r\no\t<superset>/superset-frontend/src/components/Loading/index.tsx\r\no\t<superset>/superset-frontend/src/components/Loading/Loading.test.tsx\r\no\t<superset>/superset/templates/superset/basic.html\r\no\t<superset>/superset-frontend/src/features/datasets/AddDataset/DatasetPanel/DatasetPanel.tsx\r\n\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThere is an inconsistency between the chart `appVersion` value and default image tag, that was introduced in PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26923.\r\n\r\nFile `Chart.yaml` declares `3.1.0` as default supported version to be deployed by the chart:\r\n```yaml\r\n...\r\napiVersion: v2\r\nappVersion: \"3.1.0\"\r\ndescription: Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application\r\nname: superset\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIt's also visible by the following command:\r\n```shell\r\n$ helm search repo superset\r\nNAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION\r\nsuperset/superset       0.12.2          3.1.0           Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready b...\r\n```\r\nHowever, the chart uses `latest` image tag that may change over time:\r\n```shell\r\n$ helm show values superset/superset --jsonpath '{.image.tag}'\r\nlatest\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, it's a good practice for Helm charts to set explicit value to `appVersion` and use it as default version to be deployed. For example, Airflow, ArgoCD and other Helm charts use this approach.\r\n**The PR partially reverts PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26923!**\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a follow up to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26701, to rely on the API filter so that only tags created by users are returned in modals/etc, avoiding the need to filter for tags with `:`. This improves the support for user tags created with `:`. \r\n\r\nI checked all the methods updated by this PR and where they're used and these changes shouldn't affect other functionalities. Also confirmed that system tags are still being added as usual. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n* Adding a tag with `:` to an asset wouldn't persist from the asset list. \r\n* Tagging the asset via the Tags list would work, but then the tag wasn't included when accessing the asset properties.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/dec372bb-c48d-4d28-b837-cd6b97ca8bc8\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n* Tags with `:` can now be assigned from the assets list and are also returned when accessing the properties modal\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/09e0e4e4-9428-458c-9877-024805b224ac\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a tag named `test:tag`. \r\n2. Navigate to **Dashboards**.\r\n3. Click on the pencil icon under the **Actions** column to modify any dashboard.\r\n4. Add the `test:tag` to the asset and save changes.\r\n5. Refresh the page, and validate that the tag is successfully associated with the asset.\r\n6. Click on the pencil icon again to access the properties, and validate the tag persist to the dropdown. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Required feature flags: `TAGGING_SYSTEM`\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-01T14:54:05Z","updated_at":"2024-07-02T20:44:24Z","closed_at":"2024-02-07T16:20:28Z","merged_at":"2024-02-07T16:20:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"e437356013adc8beb2eca39a31beca6ba56f4c23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6266256449,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABdX98QQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v3.1","name":"v3.1","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":"Label

SUMMARY\r\nIn the table chart, when scrollbar is set to be always visible (on macOS Sonoma: System settings -> Appearance -> Show scroll bars -> Always), it takes some space in table's body and pushes its content to the left. That causes the totals and headers to appear misaligned with the body.\r\nThis problem doesn't occur on default scrollbar settings in macOS - in this case when the scrollbar appears, it is displayed over the scroll container and doesn't cause a layout shift.\r\n\r\n`scrollbar-gutter: stable` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter) css declaration reserves the space required for the scrollbar to appear and not cause a layout shift and it works well for both scrollbar system settings (though in the auto mode we waste a few pixels). We add it to the body (scroll container), but also to the header and footer (totals) so that they both account for the layout shift that happens in body.\r\n\r\nCC @vasu-ram\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1051\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/372883ff-67a6-43ec-b85a-efe0b2b3d7c7\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/bd4aad36-113e-4a73-9a7f-e92e7a36073d\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a table chart with a few columns and enough rows to trigger overflow\r\n2. In Customize tab, align all columns to the left\r\n3. Check \"Show totals\"\r\n4. If you're using macOS - set the scrollbar to be always visible (System settings -> Appearance -> Show scroll bars -> Always)\r\n5. Verify that values in table's body are aligned with headers and totals\r\n6. Set the scrollbar to the default behaviour (System settings -> Appearance -> Show scroll bars -> Automatically based on mouse or trackpad)\r\n7. Verify that everything's still aligned\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nPR #26453 introduced important accessibility upgrades, but broke displaying table totals in sticky mode. Since the totals being always visible (sticky) is a key feature of the table chart, I think we should revert the accessibility PR and reopen it once the bug is fixed.\r\n\r\nCC @ncar285 @eschutho \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore the revert:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/20cf0f7a-0601-4ff5-b172-4cf24ea04e51\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/e79efd86-7825-4e33-8239-a81e2bc0a723\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a table chart with enough rows to enable scrolling\r\n2. Check \"Show totals\"\r\n3.

Previously, this was whatever the repository default was. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2079\">#2079</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.23.0 - 08 Jan 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in January 2024 that will disable Python dependency installation by default for all users. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. You can override this behavior by setting <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION=false</code> in your workflow, however we plan to remove this ability in future versions of the CodeQL Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2031\">#2031</a></li>\n<li>The CodeQL Action now requires CodeQL version 2.11.6 or later. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/#2227---16-nov-2023\">the corresponding changelog entry for CodeQL Action version 2.22.7</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2009\">#2009</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.22.12 - 22 Dec 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2047\">#2047</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.22.11 - 13 Dec 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[v3+ only] The CodeQL Action now runs on Node.js v20. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2006\">#2006</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.10 - 12 Dec 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2016\">#2016</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.9 - 07 Dec 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.22.8 - 23 Nov 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2001\">#2001</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.7 - 16 Nov 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.11.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 8 November 2023 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action v2.23.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1993\">#1993</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.11.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.10.5 and 2.11.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.22.7</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.6 - 14 Nov 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers running Python analysis on macOS using version 2.14.6 or earlier of the CodeQL CLI should upgrade to CodeQL CLI version 2.15.0 or later. If you do not wish to upgrade the CodeQL CLI, ensure that you are using Python version 3.11 or earlier, as CodeQL version 2.14.6 and earlier do not support Python 3.12. You can achieve this by adding a <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python\"><code>setup-python</code></a> step to your code scanning workflow before the step that invokes <code>github/codeql-action/init</code>.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1978\">#1978</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.5 - 27 Oct 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a continuation of #26875, and refactors all Python enums to comply with the commonly used naming conventions of PascalCase for the class name, and UPPER_CASE for the names: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html This exercise was quite a bit less painful than on the frontend. üò∏ \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm not aware of anything that would come close to ESLint for Python, so for now we'll just have to try to make sure everyone adheres to these conventions during code review. I believe something similar might be possible with pylint, but I wasn't able to scope it to only apply to enums, so I'll just leave it be. But if someone knows how this can be done, or can point me in the right direction, please do let me know.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Python unit tests locally I would run into issue where no users existed for specifiic roles. For the integration tests we explicitly load these test users, however this isn't the case for unit tests‚Äîeven though said users are required.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be prudent to make adding the test users a precursor to running all Python tests (be that unit or integration) either locally or remotely. \r\n\r\nInitially I added the step immediately after we run `superset db upgrade` but before we run `superset init` as is inline with the procedure outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md?plain=1#L486-L492) however (for some weird reason the unit tests failed). Adding them after the initialization (akin to how they were invoked in the integration tests) ensured the tests passed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

href=\"https://tsup.egoist.dev\">tsup</a>, in order for the package to support the <code>use client</code> directive. Hopefully it shouldn't have an impact on usage, but changing build output, always carries a slight risk of some tooling breaking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes the export file names. If you relied on importing files directly, then you'll need to change the imports.</li>\n<li>Drops bundling the &quot;umd&quot; version.

releases of Helm. It then filters out the release as specified in the input. If 3.* has been specified, it'll get the latest Helm 3 release. Similarly if 2.* has been specified, it'll get the latest Helm 2 release. In case of latest, it'll fetch the latest Helm 3 release (to keep the behaviour consistent with previous action release).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/5119fcb9089d432beecbf79bb2c7915207344b78\"><code>5119fcb</code></a> v3 new release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/104\">#104</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/f382f75448129b3be48f8121b9857be18d815a82\"><code>f382f75</code></a> v3 new release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/101\">#101</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/b5b231a831f96336bbfeccc1329990f0005c5bb1\"><code>b5b231a</code></a> v3 new release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/89\">#89</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/84b304dfb7ce923c8640d946349ca62a26b459da\"><code>84b304d</code></a> v3 new release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/87\">#87</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/e4f3964f67aac34233ac06d6614802b7040f2a7c\"><code>e4f3964</code></a> v3 new release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/84\">#84</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/20d2b4f98d41febe2bbca46408499dbb535b6258\"><code>20d2b4f</code></a> v3 new release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/80\">#80</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/a767c8d3a1d6e422da778d35c2831cb7b9f2d791\"><code>a767c8d</code></a> fix jest version (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/76\">#76</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/97c3a3f13858039df0a5603e23ab315fb8c313ac\"><code>97c3a3f</code></a> upgraded to Node16 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/74\">#74</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/0a86c98d612a24c96624184aa6db2acbc98ac9ee\"><code>0a86c98</code></a> Fix codeowners (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/71\">#71</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/setup-helm/commit/39f78708c21fabb33c6907e8c63e1d575d7e11d6\"><code>39f7870</code></a> add version support message (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/azure/setup-helm/issues/69\">#69</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/azure/setup-helm/compare/v1...v3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=azure/setup-helm&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=1&new-version=3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

PR adds a new page to the docs under \"Installation and Configuration\" titled \"Docker Images and Tags\"\r\n\r\nIt also:\r\n- adds new tags for PRs as in `PR_5287` + unit tests for that\r\n- points the docker-compose-non-dev, which assumes prod to the lean build (`latest`) since the dev build isn't as secure\r\n- adds a `--force-latest` flag to the build_docker.py script\r\n- fixes a merge conflict around ephemeral builds, where I had refactored the command, but it moved to a new location so I have to re-refactor it\r\n\r\nFor the text, I have GPT proof read it and I rendered it

SUMMARY\r\nOnce `migrateQueryEditorFromLocalStorage` executes successfully, the queryEditor continues to retain `inLocalStorage` as `true`. (It is corrected once the browser is reloaded, but persists during the session.) Consequently, it is filtered out from the backend persist syncer. Furthermore, this action can be initiated multiple times, potentially storing the same query editor in the backend more than once, as the Single Page Application (SPA) navigation can trigger the componentDidMount.\r\nThis commit corrects the missing inLocalStorage update required for the hotfix.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\ntest specs\r\n- set BACKEND_PERSISTENCE_MODE false to true and then navigate back-and-forth to SQL Lab\r\n- check the tab names\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SQLLab history page, the `query` table is used to store SQL queries. However, the `sql` column may contain CRLF \r\n characters due to user operations on Windows systems. This can lead to errors in SQL Lab history display, as it interferes with the operation of sqlglot(#26767). \r\nThe solution involves using the `strip` method when parsing the input string with `sqlgolt.parse(...)` to remove leading and trailing whitespace, including CRLF characters. This ensures that the SQL queries are properly formatted and displayed without errors in the SQLLab history.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/16112914/45468a7d-2013-4cbd-a48a-641510b54711)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26200 in order to try to rid the system of any non-global Flask-SQLAlchemy sessions (outside of Alembic migrations) via a more aggressive approach. This is somewhat of a prerequisite in order for us to define a consistent \"unit of work\" model.\r\n\r\nNote I suspect passing of the SQLAlchemy session exists in part for testing purposes‚Äîthough in reality one should never add code complexity to aid with testing when mocking is an option. Specifically there exists a mocked session with pre-loaded data which is leveraged by a slew of tests, however the `session` fixture (which relies on the [`get_session`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/73d118c0e2e967621a878ad73578d9d580f88678/tests/unit_tests/conftest.py#L41-L68) fixture), clearly mocks the Flask-SQLAlchemy session, \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/73d118c0e2e967621a878ad73578d9d580f88678/tests/unit_tests/conftest.py#L65\r\n\r\nthus there's no need to reference the fixture session directly as `db.session` points to the same in memory session.\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is this PR should provide a decent amount of code cleanup by removing unnecessary redundancy. I've also updated numerous tests to use `db.session` everywhere (as opposed to `session` or `session_with_data`) given it's monkey patched (as mentioned previously). This helps to ensure consistency throughout the code base which aids with readability. Additionally it reiterates that there is really only one session‚Äîthe global Flask-SQLAlchemy session‚Äîwhich should be used.\r\n\r\nThe _only_ place where passing `db.session` still persists in for functions which are related to Alembic migrations (including tests) as the migrations currently use a session other than the Flask-SQLAlchemy one. You can read more about that in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26172.\r\n\r\nI've also declared that the `db`, `sesh`, and `session` variable be a disallowed name (even though there maybe the odd false positive). This should help prevent developers from trying to pass around either the global Flask-SQLAlchemy session or referencing another session as well as ensuring that we don't convolute the `db` name. There still exists instances where this is used, however this is deemed an anti-pattern which we should strive to remove.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n* ~~Temporarily removes the deny-list for license types. For some reason it's blocking a goofily-licensed submodule, which is perfectly license compatible (MIT). I'll flip this back on once I'm done with this effort.~~ Resolved.\r\n* Upgrades BOTH the Superset Storybook and superset-ui-demo to Storybook 7\r\n* Migrates all the Stories to use Controls instead of Knobs\r\n* Includes all the Stories from superset-ui-demo in the main Superset storybook (you can still run `superset-ui-demo` on its own as well, though)\r\n* Migrates `mdx` stories (overviews) to `tsx` - these might need touchups\r\n* Fixes a bunch of little random bugs along the way\r\n* Removes a bunch of package vulnerabilities (1 critical, 17 high, 11 moderate)\r\n* Bumps ESLint and Prettier by necessity, and for the sake of making this PR mergable, disables the new offences - we'll get those in follow-up PRs, I promise.\r\n* Touches many other moving parts - it's all a house of cards... but things seem to be running stably. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nA typo in the method name for `epoch_ms_to_dttm` (it was called `epoch_ms_to_dttm_`) in the Pinot DB Engine Spec caused `epoch_ms_to_dttm` to not be correctly overridden. This meant that the base method was called when processing Epoch MS timestamps and results of datetime conversions were incorrect.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Start a Pinot server and create a table with a datetime column that is storing data in Milliseconds from Epoch\r\n2. Add that table as a data source to Superset\r\n3. Choose any chart and make the time column the X-Axis and pick any function as the metric\r\n4. Without this fix, the timestamps for data should incorrectly be shown as 1970.\r\n5. With this fix, the timestamp will be correct.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing
