Addressing the first problem was straightforward, but the second problem required quite a bit of work because of the dependence on `KafkaController` for all of the events. It seemed to make sense to separate the events from the processing of events so that we could remove this dependence and improve testability. With the refactoring, I was able to add test cases covering most of the logic in `ControllerChannelManager` including the generation of requests and the expected response handling logic. Note that I have not actually changed any of the event handling logic in `KafkaController`.\r\n\r\nWhile refactoring this logic, I found that the event queue time metric was not being correctly computed. The problem is that many of the controller events were singleton objects which inherited the `enqueueTimeMs` field from the `ControllerEvent` trait. This would never get updated, so queue time would be skewed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

`StreamsMetricsImpl` wraps the Kafka Streams' metrics registry and provides logic to create \r\n   and register sensors and their corresponding metrics. An example for such logic can be found in \r\n   `threadLevelSensor()`. Furthermore, `StreamsMetricsmpl` keeps track of the sensors on the \r\n   different levels of an application, i.e., thread, task, etc., and provides logic to remove sensors per \r\n   level, e.g., `removeAllThreadLevelSensors()`. There is one `StreamsMetricsImpl` object per \r\n   application instance.\r\n- `ThreadMetrics` contains only static methods that specify all built-in thread-level sensors and \r\n   metrics and provide logic to register and retrieve those thread-level sensors, e.g., `commitSensor()`. \r\n- From anywhere inside the code base with access to `StreamsMetricsImpl`, thread-level sensors can \r\n   be accessed by using ThreadMetrics.\r\n- `ThreadsMetrics` does not inherit from `StreamsMetricsImpl` anymore.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-25T00:28:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T10:53:30Z","closed_at":"2019-06-03T21:31:20Z","merged_at":"2019-06-03T21:31:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"17712b96c86d6c2cce695531d7e5f2e3d5718b21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ce9250c078e701030e104f75c156a0dbf4634196","head":{"label":"cadonna:AK6819-refactor_build-in_metrics","ref":"AK6819-refactor_build-in_metrics","sha":"ce9250c078e701030e104f75c156a0dbf4634196","user":{"login":"cadonna","id":1042170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna","html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133087300,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzMwODczMDA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"cadonna/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cadonna","id":1042170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna","html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch fixes a bug in JOIN_GROUP handling. Currently, because ImplicitLinkedHashSet implements Set, invoking `joinGroupRequest.data().protocols().asScala.map` returns a Set and can cause the protocols to lose their ordering. By changing ImplicitLinkedHashSet to implement Collection but not Set, the ordering is preserved when invoking `map`. Tested with unit tests and ConsumerRollingUpgradeTest, which intermittently fails under the old behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

going through the review of InMemorySessionStore I realized there is also some minor cleanup to be done for the other in-memory stores. This includes trivial changes such as removing unnecessary references to 'this' and moving collection initialization to the declaration. It also fixes some unsafe behavior (registering an iterator from inside its own constructor). In-memory window store iterator classes were made static and some instances of KeyValueIterator missing types were fixed across a handful of tests\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

controller maintains a bunch of state across `ControllerContext`, `PartitionStateMachine`, `ReplicaStateMachine`, and `TopicDeletionManager`. None of this state is actually isolated from the rest. For example, topics undergoing deletion are intertwined with the partition and replica states. As a consequence of this, each of these components tends to be dependent on all the rest, which makes testing and reasoning about the system difficult. This is a first step toward untangling all the state. I have simply moved it all into `ControllerContext` and removed many of the circular dependencies. So far, this is mostly a direct translation, but in the future we can add additional validation in `ControllerContext` to make sure that state is maintained consistently.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have created several mock objects to enable easier testing: `MockReplicaStateMachine` and `MockPartitionStateMachine`. These have simplified logic for updating the current state. This is used to create some new test cases for `TopicDeletionManager`. I found that I had to change the valid previous state of `ReplicaDeletionIneligible` to include `OfflineReplica` to get the new tests to pass, but please make sure there is not a bug in the test case.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

when opening a new instance of RocksDB, we first set the default options before reading in any user supplied ones through RocksDBConfigSetter. One such option is the TableFormatConfig, for which we create a new BlockBasedTableConfig object, set its specific options, and then pass to the options#setTableFormatConfig.\r\n\r\nA new TableFormatConfig has its filter parameter initialized to null, which we set to a new BloomFilter() by default and which most users probably want to keep even if they override the other defaults. The problem is if they do override other defaults involving tableConfig, they must do so by making a new BlockBasedTableConfig and then calling options#setTableFormatConfig with it. \r\n\r\nIf they only change e.g. the block cache size through this parameter, they override the default tableConfig with their custom one which has its filter set to null. So we should warn users whose RocksDBConfigSetter involves setting a new BlockBasedTableConfig that they should probably also set the filter on this object as well.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

Kafka receives a metadata request to get metadata for some non-existent topic and if `auto.create.topics.enable` is true, it automatically creates that non-existent topic with the default number of partitions and replication factor. The current logging provides minimum information when this automatic topic creation happens.\r\n\r\nIn some situations, knowing which application/client triggers the auto-topic creation would be very useful. For example, for a Kafka cluster with `auto.create.topics.enable` being true, some Kafka users might have their business log relies on the fact that this configuration property is true. However, `auto.create.topics.enable` is required to be set to false for some reason, knowing which applications/clients trigger the auto-topic creation would help cluster operators identify who are potentially going to be affected by this configuration change a so that some actions could be taken ahead of time.","created_at":"2019-04-13T00:48:27Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T18:31:23Z","closed_at":"2019-07-23T18:31:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7ec71caf109313517405a8fd971e40f5efcc8dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d07de99af3b808eedc87f5140729951884888dac","head":{"label":"Lincong:lincong-add-logging-for-auto-topic-creation","ref":"lincong-add-logging-for-auto-topic-creation","sha":"d07de99af3b808eedc87f5140729951884888dac","user":{"login":"Lincong","id":9780681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3ODA2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9780681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong","html_url":"https://github.com/Lincong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177313021,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzczMTMwMjE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"Lincong/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lincong","id":9780681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3ODA2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9780681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong","html_url":"https://github.com/Lincong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lincong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lincong/kafka","description":"Mirror

Description\r\n\r\n**Jira ticket**: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8212\r\n\r\n- Fixed the table from cutting off the text by changing the table class to `datatable` (re-using a style that was already in the CSS and has an `overflow` property set).  \r\n\r\n- This isn't the ideal fix. Given the current CSS, the `<pre>` items _should_ have a horizontal scroll, but they don't. If the entries in the first column of this table get too long, it will cut off the final column text. I tried several strategies, and nothing seemed to work. Can revisit if I have more time, this should work for now.\r\n\r\n## Related\r\nPR on `kafka-site`: https://github.com/apache/kafka-site/pull/200\r\n\r\n## Reviewers, cc:\r\n\r\n@mjsax , @guozhangwang

patch fixes a bug in the append logic which can cause duplicate offsets to be appended to the log when the append to the transaction index fails. Rather than incrementing the log end offset after the index append, we do it immediately after the records are written to the log. If the index append later fails, we do two things:\r\n\r\n1) We ensure that the last stable offset cannot advance. This guarantees that the aborted data will not be returned to the user until the transaction index contains the corresponding entry.\r\n2) We skip updating the end offset of the producer state. When recovering the log, we will have to reprocess the log and write the index entries.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-12T09:19:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-18T15:41:33Z","closed_at":"2019-04-18T15:41:33Z","merged_at":"2019-04-18T15:41:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"6964c356aa0acdb96d5ccb689a088ba224cf41f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c579bd7210f290b8070c28c6ac20f90e4af9bb41","head":{"label":"hachikuji:KAFKA-7866","ref":"KAFKA-7866","sha":"c579bd7210f290b8070c28c6ac20f90e4af9bb41","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

KAFKA-6647 KafkaStreams.cleanUp creates .lock file in directory its trying to clean (Windows OS) has been open for a while, and long conversation in previous Pull Requests. Anyway this problems is causing the TopologyTestDriver driver based unit test failing in Windows if not adding extra exception handling in there.\r\n\r\nThis PR version is trying to keep the general functionality as similar as earlier. Only add one extra retry of delete, if first failed due to DirectoryNotExmptyException. When added the retry logic only at the end of finally, caused checkstyle CyclomaticComplexity and NPathComplexity to go above threshold.\r\nAfter it extracted cleanRemovedTaskDir and deleteTaskDir methods to avoid complexity.\r\nAlso time condition evaluation changed to be first before locking, so no need to lock if inner block is doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo external functionality changed, so no additional test cases added.\r\n\r\nFollowing five test in StateDirectoryTest failed earlier in Windows.\r\nStateDirectoryTest.shouldCleanUpTaskStateDirectoriesThatAreNotCurrentlyLocked\r\nStateDirectoryTest.shouldCleanupStateDirectoriesWhenLastModifiedIsLessThanNowMinusCleanupDelay\r\nStateDirectoryTest.shouldNotLockStateDirLockedByAnotherThread\r\nStateDirectoryTest.shouldNotUnLockStateDirLockedByAnotherThread\r\nStateDirectoryTest.shouldCleanupAllTaskDirectoriesIncludingGlobalOne\r\n\r\nTest shouldNotLockStateDirLockedByAnotherThread is still failing due to\r\nthere is no way to unlock task of already dead thread without adding extra code to StateDirectory class.\r\nThe test left as is, but explanatory comment added. The rest four of those five tests are now successful also in Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso shouldUseSerdesDefinedInMaterializedToConsumeGlobalTable test in StreamsBuilderTest failed in Windows before this change. After the change all the tests in StreamsBuilderTest are succesful.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

a partial message format upgrade, it is possible for the message format to flap between new and old versions. If we detect that data appended to the log is on an old format, we can clear the leader epoch cache so that we revert to truncation by high watermark. Once the upgrade completes and all replicas are on the same format, we will append to the epoch cache as usual.

redundantly executes a couple test cases which were included in the abstract class `BaseConsumerTest`. We should try to keep a cleaner separation of testing logic and utility logic so that this does not happen (the build time is long enough without doing unnecessary work). This PR moves the cluster initialization and consumer utilities out of BaseConsumerTest and into a new class AbstractConsumerTest. We then let ConsumerBounceTest extend AbstractConsumerTest.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and
