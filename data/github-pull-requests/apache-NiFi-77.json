unit test for DATE type used GMT timezone, that causes an assertion error in timezones such as EST (-5).\r\nWe need to use local timezone instead of GMT, as Derby and PutSQL uses local timezone.\r\n\r\nThe unit test failed before as follows:\r\n- Unit test code, passed: '2002-02-02 GMT'\r\n- PutSQL code convertedi it to local: '2002-02-01 EST', and stored as '2002-02-01' in Derby

Recommendations:\r\n\r\nUsing a secured Zookeeper instance with predefined paths/znodes use the ZK Migrator to first export a json file containing nodes information.  Then that json file can be edited to alter or add acls to existing paths.  The file can then be reapplied to the source ZK server using the following example command:\r\n\r\n`./zk-migrator.sh -s -z <zookeeper-server>:2181/nifi -f <zk-node-acl-json-file> -k <client-jaas-file> --ignore-source --use-existing-acl`\r\n\r\nConfirm that acls are applied as expected using the zkCli.sh (or some other ZK Client tool)\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

allows user to enable SASL based ACL's for nodes created via Curator for cluster management (e.g. leader election nodes, Cluster Coordinator/Primary Nodes).\r\n\r\nFor testing would recommend the following actions:\r\n\r\n1) Follow the updated administrator guide  for enabling kerberos on Zookeeper (external or embedded) and NiFi\r\n\r\n2)Testing with nifi nodes where principals vary across servers.  For example nifi/instance1@REALM.COM vs nifi/instance2@REALM.COM.  In this case the kerberos.removeHostFromPrincipal would need to be true (in both zookeeper.properties and nifi.properties) to ensure that the user will be normalized as nifi@REALM.COM for acls.\r\n\r\n3) Ensuring leader election scenarios work as expected with acls in place on the /nifi path (acl should be 'sasl', <user> cdrwa and 'world', anyone r).  Recommended scenario is removal of Cluster Coordinator from a cluster to ensure new coordinator is elected. \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
