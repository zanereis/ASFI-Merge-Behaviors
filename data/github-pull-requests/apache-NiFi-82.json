PR contains two changes to flow.xml schema validation:\r\n\r\n1.) Schema validation errors are now handled and logged to the nifi-app.log file as warnings, with text indicating that these are schema validation errors for the flow configuration.  This should eliminate ominously vague nastygrams in the bootstrap log file.  The new warnings look like this:\r\n\r\n> 2017-03-11 12:36:13,329 WARN [main] o.a.n.c.StandardFlowSynchronizer Schema validation error parsing Flow Configuration at line 52, col 40: cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'template'. One of '{processor, inputPort, outputPort, label, funnel, processGroup, remoteProcessGroup, connection, controllerService}' is expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.) The FlowConfiguration.xsd schema has been updated to include templates.  I did not detail the schema of the `snippet` element that forms most of a template, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n * I'm lazy\r\n * While the snippet contents are logically similar to the RootProcessGroupType or ProcessGroupType, snippets are serialized through a different process which produces different element names and element ordering.  I do not believe it is possible to reuse the schema types for processors, process groups, connectors, etc.  A new parallel set of snippet-specific schema types would be needed, and I'm not convinced that would add value to the validation.\r\n * Combining the two factors above, I decided that addressing the validation errors for templates was enough.\r\n----\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

to avoid blocking on VM deployment.\r\n\r\nThis PR needs review in a specific environment. The reported issue is that NiFi running in a container or Virtual Machine environment that does not have access to sufficient entropy will block indeterminately on startup, right after the \"Loaded *n* properties\" message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-03-08 16:38:07,479 INFO [main] org.apache.nifi.NiFi Launching NiFi...\r\n2017-03-08 16:38:07,656 INFO [main] o.a.nifi.properties.NiFiPropertiesLoader Determined default nifi.properties path to be '/Users/alopresto/Workspace/nifi/nifi-assembly/target/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT/./conf/nifi.properties'\r\n2017-03-08 16:38:07,659 INFO [main] o.a.nifi.properties.NiFiPropertiesLoader Loaded 124 properties from /Users/alopresto/Workspace/nifi/nifi-assembly/target/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT/./conf/nifi.properties\r\n2017-03-08 16:38:07,665 INFO [main] org.apache.nifi.NiFi Loaded 124 properties\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have added a Java runtime argument to `conf/bootstrap.conf` which directs Java to point the Entropy Gathering Device (`java.security.egd`) to `/dev/urandom`. This is *not* a security concern because NiFi is *not* generating long-lived secrets at startup (many additional explanatory resources in NIFI-3313). \r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot reproduce the original issue locally. I have tried running the application on my native OS (Mac OS X 10.11.6), in a Docker container (`aldrin/apache-nifi`) on the Boot2Docker ISO, and in a Docker container (`aldrin/apache-nifi`) on a new Ubuntu Xerial 16.04.2 LTS installation inside VirtualBox. In none of these environments could I successfully block NiFi from starting. \r\n\r\nI request that whoever reviews this is someone who has encountered the blocking issue and can consistently reproduce it in order to ensure this change solves the problem. I have run the patched version on native OS (i.e. direct access to PRNG) and there were no ill effects. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the ability to specify topics as a regular expression as natively supported in the Kafka client.  The current ConsumeKafka* modules only support the topic name as a single string or list of strings.  The regex (Pattern object) format is much more flexible.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented with a new PropertyDescriptor to differentiate between string name(s) and patterns, defaulting to the existing string(s).  It might be possible to automatically identify strings or patterns, but since some strings are also valid regex patterns with slightly different meanings it seems safer to set a property -- as @joewitt commented on this ticket in Aug. 2016.\r\n\r\nUpdated Kafka client from 0.10.0.1 to 0.10.1.1\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Thus, after a while in that\r\nsituation, Kafka server rebalances the client, and then if downstream\r\nflow backs to normal and ConsumeKafka is scheduled again, the client is no\r\nlonger has a valid connection, and a warning message is logged.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses Kafka pause/resume consumer API to tell Kafka server that\r\nthe client doesn't want to consume any message but still alive. It uses\r\nanother internal thread to do so by periodically checks when was the\r\nlast time that onTrigger is executed. If it has been a while since last\r\nonTrigger (poll), then it pauses the consumer and poll to send a\r\nheartbeat so that the connection will be kept.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

using GenerateTableFetch it places no right hand boundary on pages of data.  This can lead to issues when the statement says to get the next 1000 records greater then a specific key, but records were added to the table between the time the processor executed and when the SQL is being executed. As a result it pulls in records that did not exist when the processor was run.  On the next execution of the processor these records will be pulled in a second time.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

The idea behind NIFI-3356 was to improve the efficiency and throughput of the Provenance Repository, as it is often the bottleneck. While testing the newly designed repository,\r\n  a handful of other, fairly minor, changes were made to improve efficiency as well, as these came to light when testing the new repository:\r\n\r\n- Use a BufferedOutputStream within StandardProcessSession (via a ClaimCache abstraction) in order to avoid continually writing to FileOutputStream when writing many small FlowFiles\r\n- Updated threading model of MinimalLockingWriteAheadLog - now performs serialization outside of lock and writes to a 'synchronized' OutputStream\r\n- Change minimum scheduling period for components from 30 microseconds to 1 nanosecond. ScheduledExecutor is very inconsistent with timing of task scheduling. With the bored.yield.duration\r\n  now present, this value doesn't need to be set to 30 microseconds. This was originally done to avoid processors that had no work from dominating the CPU. However, now that we will yield\r\n  when processors have no work, this results in slowing down processors that are able to perform work.\r\n- Allow nifi.properties to specify multiple directories for FlowFile Repository\r\n- If backpressure is engaged while running a batch of sessions, then stop batch processing earlier. This helps FlowFiles to move through the system much more smoothly instead of the\r\n  herky-jerky queuing that we previously saw at very high rates of FlowFiles.\r\n- Added NiFi PID to log message when starting nifi. This was simply an update to the log message that provides helpful information.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

certificates\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nIssue behind this improvement is: if you have a load balancer in front of your NiFi cluster, you may have the following issue - when accessing the UI (secured cluster, HTTPS) you might face a certificate issue because the certificate issuer won't match the address of the load balancer. One option to solve this issue is to add, in addition to the node host name, the load balancer address as Subject Alternative Names in the certificate. This should help when deploying tools like Knox, HAProxy, etc, in front of NiFi with HTTPS access.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option in the TLS Toolkit when using it in client mode. The option allows user to define a comma separated list of domains to add as SAN (in the example: the node and the load balancer). The domains will be added in the CSR sent to the CA and the CA will issue a signed certificate containing the same SAN.\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
