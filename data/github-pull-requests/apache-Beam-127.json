reverts the use of `translations.pack_combiners` in DataflowRunner added in #13763, but preserves other changes (i.e. minor bug fix in `translations.pack_combiners`, disabling optimizations by default, and testing that `translations.pack_combiners` is disabled).\r\n\r\nThis reason for the revert is that `translations.pack_combiners` results in packed CombinePerKey transforms without subtransforms which is not accepted by Dataflow, and that `Pipeline.from_runner_api` will break cross-language pipelines\r\n\r\nCherry-pick of #13884.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you

few simultaneous changes here:\r\n- Allow pyarrow up to 3.x, numpy up to 1.21.x\r\n- Modifies CI to use numpy <1.20.0 when testing pyarrow <3 to workaround ARROW-11450\r\n- Adds a new `uses_pyarrow` mark, so that we can test both `parquetio_test` and `dataframe.io_test` against multiple pyarrow versions\r\n\r\nNote this does _not_ protect our users from using numpy 1.20.0 and pyarrow <3. Unfortunately it doesn't look like there's a way to achieve that in setup.py.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

reverts the use of `translations.pack_combiners` in DataflowRunner added in #13763, but preserves other changes (i.e. minor bug fix in `translations.pack_combiners`, disabling optimizations by default, and testing that `translations.pack_combiners` is disabled).\r\n\r\nThis reason for the revert is that `translations.pack_combiners` results in packed `CombinePerKey` transforms without subtransforms which is not accepted by Dataflow, and that `Pipeline.from_runner_api` will break cross-language pipelines\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

indentation error in portable_runner.py is causing optimizations to not run when pre_optimize is set to default or all. This was broken by #13573. Additionally, the existing 'all' optimizations branch is not working in PortableRunner due to `greedily_fuse_stages` and `partial=False`.\r\n\r\nThis change re-enables optimizations for 'default' and 'all'. It also disables `translations.pack_combiners` due to BEAM-11715, and adds an 'all_without_fusion' option that is used to run `PortableRunnerOptimizedWithoutFusion`.\r\n\r\nCherry-pick of #13824.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of MQTT sometimes subscribe to multiple topics but still need access to the individual topic of each message. With these changes, instead of byte arrays, the MqttIO reader returns \"MqttMessage\" objects that include a topic string and a timestamp instant in addition to the byte array payload. \r\n\r\nThese changes likely break previous usages of the MqttIO. I am adding this pull request as a draft since I heavily depend on the added functionality but have not yet implemented proper tests. \r\n\r\nFor a more in-depth description of the issue, please see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65780456/working-with-protobuf-encoded-mqtt-streams-in-apache-beam.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`translations.pack_combiners` produces a `CombinePerKey` with no subtransforms, but some runners do not treat `CombinePerKey` as a primitive transform and require the `GroupByKey`, `Combine` and / or `ParDo(CombineValuesDoFn)` subtransforms to be present. This changes `translations.pack_combiners` to add the required subtransforms to the `CombinePerKey`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this reverts some changes to DataflowRunner from #13763. It removes a workaround that used `PTransformOverride` to recreate the subtransforms.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

user side direction of cross language or external transforms.\r\n\r\nOften the runners have their own mechanism for interpretting a URN + Payload, but that payload may contain data to specify how to route the inputs and outputs. ExternalTagged permits users to provide local tags for the input PCollections and output PCollection types to assist with this routing.\r\n\r\nLater changes may want to add variadic Options to External and ExternalTagged to support Artifact provisioning, and Environment setting, though preferablly without using the beam protos directly in the API.

this change, it's possible that an incorrectly specified expression can create a flaky test. Since we only keep the result from the last executed partitioning, it's possible to get a false positive if, say, Singleton partitioning was used last.

PR adds support for [GroupBy.apply](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#flexible-apply). In general this is a pretty simple operation, just a very customizable unliftable aggregation, but there's one major complication: the frames passed to the apply function include the _original_ index, while our groupby(..) implementation overrides any existing index with just the grouping indexes/columns so we can conveniently use Index() partitioning.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple possible approaches to get the original index through, but neither is perfect:\r\n1. Move the original indexes into columns, use set_index to move them back after grouping.\r\n2. Don't remove the original indexes in groupby(..), instead just add any grouped columns, and keep all the original indexes. Then use Index(grouping_indexes + grouping_columns) partitioning.\r\n\r\nI spent some time trying to get (1) to work, but the book-keeping proved to be too painful. Handling grouped Series is tough, since they need to be turned into DataFrames and back, and projections on the DeferredGroupBy are tricky as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses option (2), which was simpler to implement, but it would be the first application of `Index([i,j])` partitioning, which hasn't been well defined. In order to limit the effect the original to_group and ungrouped expressions are still used for operations that don't need the original index.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n@TheNeuralBit @rosetn @aaltay \r\n\r\nMade a few fixes and clarifications to the Java quickstart:\r\n* Changed the intro sentence to be closer to the Python quickstart and updated the phrasing for readability.\r\n* Added two sentences clarifying how to respond to prompts during the Maven-to-Gradle conversion.\r\n* Clarified a change required in **build.gradle**.\r\n* Added a sentence telling users to use the direct runner, if they're just trying out Beam and aren't sure what to use.\r\n* Made it clear that the procedure for running a pipeline is a generic procedure, and the actual commands for running WordCount are in the sections below.\r\n* Made a few other minor readability tweaks.\r\n* Resolves

indentation error in portable_runner.py is causing optimizations to not run when pre_optimize is set to default or all. This was broken by #13573. Additionally, the existing 'all' optimizations branch is not working in PortableRunner due to `greedily_fuse_stages` and `partial=False`.\r\n\r\nThis change re-enables optimizations for 'default' and 'all'. It also disables `translations.pack_combiners` due to BEAM-11715, and adds an 'all_without_fusion' option that is used to run `PortableRunnerOptimizedWithoutFusion`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum compression or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger.\r\n\r\nEven if there is support for Snappy in Beam's dependencies, there was no way of matching .snappy files to the given (de)compressor.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides that.\r\n\r\nR: @iemejia\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
