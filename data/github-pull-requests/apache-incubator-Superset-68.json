SUMMARY\r\nThis PR helps to solve [16742](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16742)\r\n\r\nWe were getting frequent 502 errors during loading of charts in dashboard forcing us to refresh the page.\r\n\r\nThis is how traffic flows in our Superset setup: AWS ALB --> Gunicorn --> Superset App\r\nWe are using official Superset docker image.\r\n\r\nI modified timeout settings i.e. GUNICORN_TIMEOUT and SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_TIMEOUT but it didn't resolve the problem.\r\nI have already increased SERVER_WORKER_AMOUNT to 8 and using default thread value of 20 but it didn't resolve the issue.\r\nMy ECS task cpu/memory are underutilized so scaling is not a cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nFinally, I saw this blog which says solution is to keep Gunicorn --keep-alive more than alb idle timeout: https://www.tessian.com/blog/how-to-fix-http-502-errors/\r\n\r\nDefault value for --keep-alive is 2, please see https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#keepalive \r\n\r\nEven Gunicorn's official documentation here https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#keepalive says:\r\n\"Generally set in the 1-5 seconds range for servers with direct connection to the client (e.g. when you don‚Äôt have separate load balancer). When gunicorn is deployed behind a load balancer, it often makes sense to set this to a higher value.\"\r\n\r\nBut run-server.sh in official docker image doesn't has an option for setting Gunicorn's --keep-alive to a custom value.\r\nSo I have done improvements in run-server.sh to allow this customization keeping the default value as 2 taken from Gunicorn's default. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps people with similar setup as mine.\r\n\r\nNote: This change is non-disruptive, no end user will be impacted unless they turn on settings.\r\nYou can also refer

in the row level security logic, but it seems there's functionality of the form,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif hasattr(g, \"user\"):\r\n    user = g.user\r\nelif username:\r\n    user = self.find_user(username=username)\r\nelse: \r\n    return []\r\n```\r\n\r\nto obtain the user associated with the RLS check. The issue is the optional `username`‚Äîwhich is used to set the user if no current user exists‚Äîwas only specified once via `get_username()` which makes the the above logic behave like, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nuser = self.find_user(username=g.user.username if g.user else None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich can be then refactored as,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nuser = g.user if hasattr(g, \"user\") else None\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich makes the `elif` clause unnecessarily as it's captured in the `if` clause. Furthermore that `g.user` and `self.find_user(...)` can return `None` and so the `else` should also replaced with the short circuit logic in essence returning if and only if there is isn't a user defined.\r\n\r\nSaid logic was added in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19999 but was likely made obsolete by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19914.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the optional `username` argument throughout the RLS code path.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `fbprophet` packages uses [`pandas.date_range`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html) per [here](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/blob/10310ceb2da05837a198db6714d658a1e0a32478/python/prophet/forecaster.py#L1567-L1570) for defining the forecast window where the frequency is defined via an [offset alias](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases).\r\n\r\nPreviously the mapping was wrong, i.e., [these weeks](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/base.py#L112-L115) which use different days of the weeks as anchors (alongside the direction of the anchor, i.e., starting vs. ending) previously all mapped to `W` which is the same as `W-SUN` and thus weekly forecasts did not adhere to the correct periodicity defined in the fitted data.\r\n\r\nThe fix is merely to use the [anchored offsets](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#anchored-offsets). Pandas doesn't do a great job in specifying whether it's the week starting or week ending on Sunday say for `W-SUN`, however it's irrelevant for our needs, i.e., for both \"Week starting Sunday\" and \"Week ending Sunday\" the data provided by Superset to `fbprohet` has been bucketed appropriately and anchored on a Sunday and thus all `fbprohet` needs to know is Sundays (`W-SUN`) defines the weekly periodicity.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested locally and updated unit

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe currently have a feature flag `RLS_IN_SQLLAB` that, when enabled, applies any relevant RLS rules to the SQL executed in SQL Lab. The current approach parses the SQL and extracts all tables being queried. If any of those tables have RLS rules associated with them the parse tree is modified inplace, appending the RLS predicate to the associated `WHERE` clause or creating a new one if needed.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch suggested an approach that is more bulletproof: replacing the table reference (eg, `my_table`) with a subquery that contains the RLS (`SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE rls`). This can be done conditionally on databases that support subqueries. I implemented that solution in this PR.\r\n\r\nNote that this method is probably still not bulletproof. We're still using `sqlparse` to find table references, and this has been error-prone in the past. For example, we had problems where the identifier \"RAW\" was not detected properly because `sqlparse` considers it a reserved keyword, since it doesn't have separate lists of keywords for each dialect.\r\n\r\nThis PR and the original implementation are both conservative in cases like these, trying to figure out if a keyword is actually and identifier, and the unit tests cover such cases. But we should consider this feature experimental, and warn users that there are risks associated with using it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

way for users to copy datasets in superset. Even though they can copy the SQL of a dataset, any changes we make to the field types (e.g., in cases where we turn long, complex types into JSON, or advanced types as described in #17852) cannot be easily copied.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nSee #20245\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThere should be a button in the actions column for virtual datasets which duplicates them with the provided name when clicked.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSuperset allows you to add custom SQL to the Time Column configuration on Charts through the UI.\r\nHowever, that feature is not implemented in the API, and instead throws a wrongly formatted request error.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for custom SQL to the time column configuration.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/172587258-c3ad6292-610c-4990-a479-fd69f90e6742.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/172587324-4a284025-42a5-4808-bf1e-38074dde018f.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a new Chart using the `Vehicle Sales` Dataset.\r\n2. On the **METRIC** configuration, set `COUNT(*)`.\r\n3. On the **TIME COLUMN** configuration, switch to the **CUSTOM SQL** tab and set `date_trunc('week', order_date)::date - 1`. \r\n4. Remove any **TIME GRAIN** if set.\r\n5. Click on **RUN**.\r\n\r\nThe query should run and return data properly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe schema level restrictions are not working properly in SQL Lab, when the default schema is used. Some DB Engines allow users to execute a query without specifying the Schema, in which default Schema will be queried.\r\n\r\nIn the permission check, we're assigning the schema from two sources: the query itself, or if it's not present, the schema selected on the left hand side in SQL Lab.\r\nIt's the second scenario that's not properly checked, because, if the user has schema permission for the one selected, and if the query can be executed in the engine without specifying the schema explicitly, then the permission check will allow said execution, since there's a permission for the schema.\r\n\r\nThis PR alters the order of checks, so that we validate that the default schema actually contains the table we're trying to query, and then check the permission on said datasource.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/172245754-0186181c-5bbb-46cd-8ae5-c104e0d6d965.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/172245791-cda848a5-aa53-41ea-a53a-477e0b5a3269.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a new user role with the following permissions:\r\n\r\n* can read on SavedQuery\r\n* can write on SavedQuery\r\n* can read on Database\r\n* can read on Query\r\n* can sqllab on Superset\r\n* can sqllab history on Superset\r\n* can sqllab viz on Superset\r\n* can sql json on Superset\r\n* can sqllab table viz on Superset\r\n* can validate sql json on Superset\r\n* can activate on TabStateView\r\n* can get on TabStateView\r\n* can put on TabStateView\r\n* can delete query on TabStateView\r\n* can post on TabStateView\r\n* can delete on TabStateView\r\n* menu access on SQL Lab\r\n* menu access on SQL Editor\r\n* schema access on [examples].[information_schema]\r\n\r\n2. Create a new user and assign the above role to it.\r\n3. Log in with that user.\r\n4. Go to SQL Lab\r\n5. Select `examples` as database and `information_schema` as schema\r\n\r\nExecute these two queries:\r\n```SQL\r\nselect * from birth_names\r\n```\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect * from

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements the redesign of viz switcher. Now user can quickly change viz type to 1 of 6 featured charts without opening the viz gallery modal.\r\nActive chart is represented by an icon and chart name. If chart's name is truncated, then tooltip appears on hover.\r\nThe rest of the featured charts are represented only by a clickable icon. Chart's name appears in a tooltip on hover. Clicking the icon switches the viz type.\r\nUser can open the viz gallery modal by clicking \"View all charts\". When user selects a chart that is not \"featured\", it's represented by a magnifying glass icon and chart's name. It's placed first on the quick viz switcher list.\r\nWhen a non-featured chart is currently rendered, it's displayed at the start of the list.\r\nCurrently rendered chart has a tooltip \"Currently rendered: <chart name>\" \r\n\r\nFeatured charts are:\r\n- Echarts Line Chart\r\n- Table\r\n- Big Number\r\n- Pie Chart\r\n- Echarts Bar Chart\r\n- Echarts Area Chart\r\n\r\nSide note - this feature will work even better when Yongjie's [standardized form data PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20010) is merged  üôÇ \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/172367517-7458e8a1-3e11-404b-97a7-a541e4ad38d4.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open explore with 1 of the featured charts\r\n2. Verify that there are 6 icons in viz switcher, the active viz is highlighted and its name is visible\r\n3. Click on any other icon, verify that the control panel now displays controls of currently active chart. Click Update Chart and verify that everything works as expected\r\n4. Click \"View all charts\", change to a non-featured chart\r\n5. Verify that now there are 7 items in viz switcher list and active non-featured chart is 1st on the list. Repeat step 3.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThe legacy line chart(NVD3) with the time shift has a feature that the derived metrics were displayed `dashed line` rather than a `solid line`. For example, a `Line Chart` has a metric be called `sum(sales)`, and select time shift `1 month ago` in `Advanced Analytics`, the line of `sum(sales)` was displayed `solid line` and derived metric `sum(sales)__1 month ago` was displayed `dashed line`.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces this feature on the new chart.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### After\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/171612311-45d7e875-95e9-4113-b558-a8e4ccbc17fb.png)\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/171612391-5f18394a-0153-4b99-b048-788e6db0f5cc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen creating a Box Plot Chart, users can set aggregations on the column(s) that will be applied on the Metrics field. However, if the Average aggregation function is set, the Chart won't load and below error message will be displayed:\r\n\r\n`ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''`\r\n\r\n`This may be triggered by:`\r\n`Issue 1011 - Superset encountered an unexpected error.`\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the boxplot post processing function uses, for most of their operators, the `nanpercentile` function.\r\nThat function won't work on objects, which is the data type for bigints in postgresql.\r\nBy coercing the type to it's numeric form we get rid of that issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/171517890-f70e7f6b-9644-494e-8ad0-ec4223e8e541.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/171517924-ba17b67a-9fd8-40fd-b979-342f5ff217c3.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Access your Workspace.\r\n2. Navigate to Charts. \r\n3. Click on the + CHART button in the top right corner to create a new Chart.\r\n4. Choose the Flights Dataset, and the Box Plot Chart.\r\n5. Click on CREATE NEW CHART button.\r\n6. Click on the Metrics pop up.\r\n7. Switch to the SIMPLE tab.\r\n8. Select the FLIGHT_NUMBER column.\r\n9. Set the AVG aggregation.\r\n10. Click on SAVE.\r\n11. Click on RUN.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nRemoves the logic to automatically send release-related emails. Now, the scripts will only generate the email content and the release manager have to manually send the emails. The objective is to avoid delivering incorrect emails to the dev list which has a big audience. The documentation was also updated with new steps related to the release. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Set the environment variables using the `set_release_env.sh` script\r\n- Execute the `generate_email.py `script for each command (`vote_pmc`, `result_pmc`, `announce`)\r\n- The script should correctly generate the email text for each command\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  -

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn the sunburst chart, there is a color policy that normally uses the category color, but when second metric value is provided and is different from the first metric value, the gradient color is used. The category color was previously introduced in color consistency, but the gradient failed in the scenario described above, so we fix it here.\r\n\r\n- Normally, category colors are used and the color scheme control is displayed\r\n- When the second metric value is provided and differs from the first metric value, the gradient color is used and the gradient color control is displayed\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/171091015-cf33d2dd-533a-4ab7-a9a4-292739497a07.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe original [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20109) intends to decouple `updateQueryFormData` and query request, but the Dashboard also depends on this action after query chart data.

SUMMARY\r\nThere's currently a lag when entering a query in the SQL Lab.\r\nIf you set some text and immediately submit the query, you'll most likely get the previous stored query executed.\r\nThis is specially notorious if you use keyboard shortcuts to fire the query.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the sql query stored locally in the component in favor of the one stored in the redux store, to prevent the two states to be out of sync.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore: \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/170585323-f8f785a3-e2f9-4c32-9e6b-1734eda8750d.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/170585343-f2fbc6bd-9683-4950-a696-9cb61576be82.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Type Select 1 in SQL Lab\r\n2. Immediately change to 1 to 2\r\n3. Use ctrl+enter to run the query\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n**How to reproduce issues**\r\n\r\n1. By default, anything typed in the password field should be masked\r\n2. User should be able to toggle to see the password and toggle back to hiding the password ONLY WHEN entering the password when CONNECTING a database, not when EDITING one\r\n3. When editing an existing db connection the password should be masked WITHOUT the option to show the password to prevent unintentionally showing passwords to someone who didn't initially connect the db\r\n4. See details in comment on show/hide icon and tooltip text\r\n\r\nThe relevant forms that this should impact:\r\nPostgres\r\nMySQL\r\nSnowflake\r\nRedshift\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nWhile testing Explore with an anonymous user, I noticed that the explore form data endpoint errored out due to calling `get_user_id()` on the anonymous user object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/ville/src/superset/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flask_appbuilder/api/__init__.py\", line 85, in wraps\r\n    return f(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File

\"/Users/ville/src/superset/superset/explore/form_data/commands/create.py\", line 54, in run\r\n    \"owner\": actor.get_user_id(),\r\nAttributeError: 'AnonymousUserMixin' object has no attribute 'get_user_id'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new util function `get_owner` that returns the id if the user is not anonymous, otherwise `None`, and replaces all direct calls to `actor.get_user_id()` with `get_owner(actor)`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I noticed that `TemporaryCache` had a lot of references to Chart, Dashboard and Dataset Exceptions, particularly `(((Chart))|(Dataset)|(Dashboard))((NotFound)|(AccessDenied))Error`. To make it more generic, we introduce a new exception `TemporaryCacheResourceNotFoundError` and reraise all occurrences of the resource-specific exceptions with the new generic one. Since the integration tests already check for the outcome (400, 403, 404 etc), the tests don't need to be updated.\r\n\r\nThe return type for the Explore util `check_access` is also removed, as it isn't needed. The method is expected to raise an exception if access is denied, hence no `Optional[bool]` is needed. The unit tests are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n40k+ people visited supserset.apache.org last month. It looks a bit like it's been put together by a backend engineer, so a few touchups go a long way. Improvements:\r\n\r\n* using the same antd theme as on Superset (though that affects a single button at this time, but using antd components should align more with Superset's theme in the future)\r\n* remove the footer that was all funky-looking, moving the links to the navbar\r\n* use a GitHub logo for the GitHub link on navbar-right\r\n* use Inter (same font as Superset)\r\n* make screenshots width more bearable (80% -> 800px)\r\n* hide fugly buttons on search input box\r\n* remove all external links icons (surprisingly hard to get docusaurus to do this)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\nConvert QueryAutoRefresh to TypeScript functional React component\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR converts QueryAutoRefresh from es6 class component to TypeScript functional component as part of bigger effort to migrate frontend code to TypeScript and functional React components defined in: https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/18388\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nThere should be no visual change to the application\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Open SQL Lab / SQL Editor\r\n2. Click the \"RUN\" button\r\n3. Ensure Query runs and updates results with same behavior that existed prior to this PR\r\n4. Test with both default behavior and asynchronous query execution on for a database\r\n\r\n**Changes to http requests for getting Query statuses:**\r\nIf you watch the dev tools network tab you should see less network traffic as the execution now ensures only one outstanding http call to check query status is made at a time to avoid http response race conditions that can lead to incorrect application state and to reduce tandem network calls on slower connections.  If the call fails, the offline state change will be triggered but the interval timer will continue attempting to reconnect and set user online and show results once the connection is restored.  This can be tested by:\r\n1. Opening the dev tools / Network / set the connection from \"No Throttling\" to \"Offline\", 2. Click the \"Run\" button as described in the initial test steps above\r\n3. See the network failure and the UI will display an \"Offline\" pill (this is not new UI behavior)\r\n4. Set the network back to \"No Throttling\" and wait a few seconds and the next interval will make a successful query status API call and you will see data results again.\r\n\r\nQueryAutoRefresh was separated into two files to separate Redux knowledge from the simple functional component:\r\n1. QueryAutoRefresh/index.ts - Simple functional component with no knowledge of Redux\r\n3. QueryAutoRefresh/QueryAutoRefreshContainer.ts - Functional component container with connection to redux state that imports and contains QueryAutoRefresh/index.ts component\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:** \r\nWhen changing QueryAutoRefresh to a functional component the behavior of setInterval no longer worked correctly.  This is a known issue with functional React components using setInterval can provide stale state / props in the interval callback creating undesired, hard to debug / fix behavior.  A new utility hook (SqlLab/utils/useInterval.ts) was introduced in this PR to handle this based on this very helpful article by Dan Abramov (thank you!): https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you
