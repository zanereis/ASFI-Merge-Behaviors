has a tendency to create deadlocks [1], and when that happens replication jobs can't start on any of the nodes in the cluster.\r\n\r\nWe don't really need strict consistent locking for replication jobs. It's mostly to avoid replication jobs thrashing the same checkpoint docs back and forth between different session IDs. So, remove global to avoid any issues around it, and replace it with `pg` -- the new (Erlang 23+) process group implementation. (Technically `global` is still running in the runtime system as it's started by the `kernel` app. We just avoid interacting with it and registering any names to avoid deadlocks).\r\n\r\nIn `pg` we start a replication `scope`, and then in that scope make every RepId a process `group`. When replication processes spawn, their Pids becomes `members` of that group:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncouch_replicator_pg (scope):\r\n        \"a12c+create_target\" (RepId group):\r\n                [Pid1, Pid2] (members)\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs per `pg` implementation, groups are created and remove automatically as members are added/removed from it, so we don't have to do anything there.\r\n\r\nIf there are already any running Pids in the same group, we avoid starting the jobs, and fail like we did before when we used global. In the even more rare case of a race condition, when 2+ jobs do manage to start, we do a membership check before each checkpoint. One of the jobs then stops to yield to another. For simplicity pick the one running on the lowest lexicographically sorted node name to survive.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/6524\r\n[2]

are two main improvements:\r\n\r\n  * Replace the auto-inserted replicator VDU with a BDU. Replicator already had\r\n    a BDU to update the `\"owner\"` field, so plug right into it and validate\r\n    everything we need there. This way, the validation and parsing logic is all\r\n    in one module. The previously inserted VDU design doc will be deleted.\r\n\r\n  * Allow constraining endpoint protocol types and socket options. Previously,\r\n    users could create replications with any low level socket options. Some of\r\n    those are dangerous and are possible \"foot-guns\". Restrict those options to\r\n    a more usable set.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those improvements, increase test coverage a bit by explicitly\r\nchecking a few more parsing corner cases.\r\n\r\nFixes

up, optimize and increase test coverage for smoosh.\r\n\r\n  * Use the new, simpler persistence module. Remove the extra `activated` vs `non-activated` state. Use `handle_continue` gen_server callback to avoid blocking smoosh application initialization. Then, let channel un-persist in their init function which happens outside the general application initialization. Persistence module commit has more details about the implementation of the persistence module itself.\r\n\r\n  * Add an index cleanup channel and enqueue index cleanup jobs by default.\r\n\r\n  * Optimize smoosh_priority queue. The separate commit message has more details.\r\n \r\n  * Remove gen_server bottlenecks for status and last update calls. Instead rely on ets table lookups and gen_casts only.\r\n\r\n  * Add a few more `try ... catch`'s to avoid crashing the channels.\r\n\r\n  * Use maps to keep track of starting and active jobs in the channel.\r\n\r\n  * Re-check priority again before starting jobs. This is needed when jobs are un-persisted after restart and database may have been compacted or deleted already.\r\n\r\n  * Update periodic channel scheduled checks to have a common scheduling mechanism.\r\n\r\n  * Remove testing-only API functions to avoid cluttering the API.\r\n\r\n  * Store messages off-heap for channels and smoosh_server.\r\n\r\n  * Instead of a per-channel `last_updated` gen_server:call(...), use a single access ets table which is periodically cleaned from stale entries. As an optimization, before enqueueing the shard, check last access first. This avoids sending an extra message to smoosh_server.\r\n \r\n  * As a protection mechanism against overload, cap the access table size at 250k entries. Don't allow enqueueing more than that many entries during the configured `[smoosh] staleness = Minutes` period.\r\n\r\n  * Increase test coverage from 60% to 90%\r\n \r\n  * Update documentation to remove the state diagram, include references to the new cleanup channel, remove reference to using `external` or `data_size` for smoosh compaction triggers.","created_at":"2022-11-15T22:58:24Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T22:04:33Z","closed_at":"2022-11-18T22:04:30Z","merged_at":"2022-11-18T22:04:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c24731a5e49bbb4a1d1f407f11f141ca8698e6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/2b1b98c19c22c1c215c6d52cd19673209ee988e8","head":{"label":"apache:optimize-smoosh","ref":"optimize-smoosh","sha":"2b1b98c19c22c1c215c6d52cd19673209ee988e8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

fabric index cleanup\r\n\r\n  * Clean-up stale view purge checkpoints. Previously we didn't, and purge\r\n    progress could have stalled by keeping around inactive lagging purge checkpoints.\r\n\r\n  * couch_mrview_cleanup attempted to clean purge checkpoints but that didn't\r\n    work for clustered databases, only for local ones. Nowadays most dbs\r\n    are clustered so make sure those work as well.\r\n\r\n  * DRY-out code from both fabric inactive index cleanup and\r\n    couch_mrview_cleanup modules. Move some of the common code to\r\n    couch_mrview_util module. couch_mrvew_cleanup is the only place in charge\r\n    the cleanup logic now.\r\n\r\n  * Consolidate and improve tests. Utility functions to get all index files,\r\n    purge checkpoint and signatures are now tested with couch_mrview_util tests,\r\n    and end-to-end fabric cleanup tests are in fabric_tests. Since fabirc_tests\r\n    covers all the test scenarios from fabric_test.exs, remove fabric_test.exs\r\n    so we don't have tests duplicated and get same coverage.\r\n\r\nThis is a partial fix for this issue https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4239\r\n\r\nAlso helps fix part of

the new `fabric:open_revs/3` API implemented in #4201 to optimize the `_bulk_get` HTTP API. Since `open_revs/3` itself is new, allow reverting to individual doc fetches using the previous `open_revs/4` API via a config setting, mostly as a precautionary measure.\r\n\r\nThe implementation consists of three main parts:\r\n  * Parse and validate args\r\n  * Fetch the docs using `open_revs/3` or `open_revs/4`\r\n  * Emit results as json or multipart, based on the `Accept` header value\r\n\r\nParsing and validation checks for various errors and then returns a map of `#{Ref => {DocId, RevOrError, DocOptions}}` and a list of Refs in the original argument order. The middle tuple element of `RevOrError` is notable that it may hold either the revision ID (`[Rev]` or `all`) or `{error, {Rev, ErrorTag, ErrorReason}}`.\r\n\r\nFetching the docs is fairly straightforward. The slightly interesting aspect is when an error is returned from `open_revs/3` we have to pretend that all the batched docs failed with that error. That is done to preserve the \"zip\" property, where all the input arguments have their matching result at the same position in results list. Another notable thing here is we fixed a bug where the error returned from `fabric:open_revs/3,4` was not formatted in a way it could have been emitted as json resulting in a function clause. That is why we call `couch_util:to_binary/1` on it. This was detected by the integration testing outline before and was missed by the previous mocked unit test.\r\n\r\nThe last part is emitting the results as either json or multipart. Here most changes are cleanups and grouping into separate handler functions. The `Accept` header can be either `multipart/related` or `multipart/mixed` and we try to emit the same content type as it was passed in the `Accept` header. One notable thing here is by DRY-ing the filtering of attachments in `non_stubbed_attachments/1` we fixed another bug when the multipart result was returning nonsense in cases when all attachments were stubs. The doc was returned as a multipart chunk with content type `multipart/...` instead of application/json. This was also detected in the integration tests described below.\r\n\r\nThe largest changes are in the testing area. Previous multipart tests were using mocks heavily, were quite fragile, and didn't have good coverage. Those tests were removed and replaced by new end-to-end tests in `chttpd_bulk_get_test.erl`. To make that happen add a simple multipart parser utility function which knows how to parse multipart responses into maps. Those maps preserve chunk headers and we can match those with `?assertMatch(...)` fairly easily. The tests try to get decent coverage for `chttpd_db.erl` bulk_get implementation and its utility functions, but they are also end-to-end tests so they test everything below, including fabric and couch layers as well.\r\n\r\nQuick 1 node testing using the couchdyno replicating of 1 million docs shows at least a 2x speedup to complete the replication using this PR.\r\n\r\nOn main:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr=rep.Rep(); r.replicate_1_to_n_and_compare(1, num=1000000, normal=True)\r\n330 sec\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n```\r\nr=rep.Rep(); r.replicate_1_to_n_and_compare(1, num=1000000, normal=True)\r\n160 sec\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndividual `_bulk_get` response times shows an even higher improvement: an 8x speedup:\r\n\r\nOn main:\r\n```\r\n[notice] ...

the cast `refresh` message didn't explicitly cancel the previous timer. If a `gen_server:call(Server, refresh)` was made and a `refresh` message was already in the message queue, it was possible to end up with two parallel refresh periods (cycles): one with the regular refresh period, the other generated by the regular refresh gen_server call.\r\n\r\nIn addition, drain all the previous refresh messages before scheduling a new timer. This should further help lower the chance of refresh cycles piling up on top of each other.\r\n\r\nThe fix is mostly theoretical as technically I don't think anything triggers a `refresh` gen_server:call/2 calls in practice. It would have to be a manual or an externally scripted call.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-17T18:32:15Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T20:51:21Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T20:51:18Z","merged_at":"2022-10-17T20:51:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3950c52057f52fe4c5d8fa00946c5c1ea5e176e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/1ffefcf5fc7171507fa522829bbdd4f75127128c","head":{"label":"apache:prometheus-fixes","ref":"prometheus-fixes","sha":"1ffefcf5fc7171507fa522829bbdd4f75127128c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

not.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, tests have been changed to use the TDEF_FE macro,\r\ncleaned up, and renamed to make them easier to understand.\r\n\r\nFinally, this simplifies the test for observing metric updates by\r\npicking a metric that increments automatically with the passage of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_prometheus suites=couch_prometheus_e2e_tests\r\n```\r\nShould have a lot less log spam now.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n

is the batched counterpart to `fabric:open_revs/4`.\r\nInstead of fetching revisions for only one document, like `fabric:open_revs/4`,\r\nit can fetch batches of document revisions. The main optimization is achieved\r\nby grouping documents by shard ranges and then spawning shard workers only once\r\nfor each range (essentially doing what fabric:update_docs/2,3 does).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to use this implementation for a more efficient version of _bulk_get.\r\nSo far this is just the fabric API, not plugged into the HTTP API yet.\r\n\r\nThe backend API for this is already available as implemented in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4185.\r\n\r\nWhile the implementation is intended to be as close as possible to\r\n`fabric:open_revs/4` there a key difference -- since we're now dealing with\r\npotentially large batches, we choose not to perform immediate read repair.\r\nInstead, we let the internal replicator handle that. Read repair can spawn an\r\nunbounded number of processes, and now with batches those could be large\r\nfabric:update_docs/2,3 requests. Issuing lots of those, especially when a\r\ncluster has a hard time keeping up, might not be a good idea.\r\n\r\nFor now we leave the `fabric:open_revs/4` implementation intact, as opposed to\r\nre-wiring it to call `fabric:open_revs/3` with a one-element list. This helps\r\nhave a test reference point (see fabric_open_revs_test for an example), allows\r\nfor a configurable fallback for _bulk_get implementation, and lets individual doc\r\nGET fetches work exactly as they have been.\r\n\r\nA few details about the implementation itself:\r\n\r\n  * The coordinator state is kept in the `#st{}` record. Each requested doc ID\r\nand revisions list argument keeps track of its quorum logic and gathers\r\nresponses in its individual `#req{}` record. There is exactly one of those for\r\neach requested `{{Id, Revs}, DocOpts}` argument.\r\n\r\n  * Since the `{{Id, Revs}, DocOpts}` arguments are not guaranteed to be unique,\r\nwe have to keep track of them so we can return the results in the same order.\r\nTo help with that we tag each with a unique reference, and keep track of it in\r\n`{atts_since, ...}` revisions, it helps to stash away the arguments separately\r\nand just operating with reference tags. Those references are usually called\r\n`ArgRef` and `ArgsRefs` in the code.\r\n\r\n  * The `#st.workers` map keeps track of the spawned workers and which args\r\nthey are responsible for. As each worker returns, or is knocked out by an\r\nerror, it gets removed from the `#st.workers` map and at the same time all the\r\nindividual requests (`#req{}` record) are updated. After the update we check if\r\nread quorum has been met and if it's still possible to succeed with the\r\nremaining workers.\r\n\r\n  * There is a 100% test coverage. The tests in the `fabric_open_revs_test`\r\nmodule are more end-to-end and they exercise various options. The tests in\r\n`fabric_open_revs` test how quorum logic and error handling works by emulating\r\nvarious workers returning and how revisions are merged together into the final\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIssue:

option is useful when we want to accumulate at least R result copies for each document. Typically R=2 in a default 3 node cluster. Without shard splitting, this would simply be waiting for at least R copies returned from each range. However, in the case when shard copies don't have exactly the same range boundaries, the correct logic is to try to completely cover the ring at least R times. The algorithm for checking if the ring can be covered is already implemented, we just add it as an option to `fabric:handle_response/4,5`.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially another preparatory PR to implement the optimized `fabric:bulk_get(...)` API as described in issue #4183 and it's just split out as a separate commit as it's a fairly standalone change.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, had noticed that the unit tests in fabric_ring didn't cover the cleanup callback function, so added tests to make sure we exercise that code path.\r\n\r\nEmacs + erlang_ls also noticed the unused header included, so

is the batched version of the existing `open_doc_revs/4` function. It turns out, the internal implementation of `open_doc_revs/4` already operated on batches, just that the batch size had always been 1, so here we just expose the batched variant.\r\n\r\nOne subtle difference from the single variant, is there are options which apply to the whole request, and some apply to individual documents only. In the previous `open_doc_revs/4` both were intermingled in the single `Options` argument. In the batched version, the per-document options are passed in each `{{Id, Rev}, DocOpts}` tuple. Here `DocOpts` will usually have `{atts_since, ...}` option, but it could have others like `ejson_body`, for example.\r\n\r\nThe API is also exposed in `fabric_rpc`. This function will be the used to optimize `_bulk_get` as described in issue 4183. To allow incremental node updates, let's have the backend implementation in a separate commit so it could be included in separate rolling updates releases.\r\n\r\nAdd some tests both for the original `open_doc_revs/4` function and batched variant. Since the internal implementation is exactly the same, the batched variant mainly checks how multiple results are returned and that per document options are applied correctly.\r\n\r\nIssue:

we always encoded the sequence as json. In case of strings, the most common case, this ended up with something like `\"\\\"1-gA..\\\"\"`. Then, the endpoints would strip out and ignore the extra `\"`. So, avoid sending the extra bytes just so they can be striped out in the end anyway. This should make the logs look a bit cleaner too.\r\n\r\nIntegers or any other sequences are still json-encoded. Integers will still look like `?since=123` and, in the unlikely we case we replicate with a BigCouch 0.4 era endpoint, the `[SeqNum, OpaqueString]` should be properly encoded as before and replications should work.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a minor annoyance when the `_scheduler/{jobs,docs}` results returning the default start sequence as `0` (an integer) even though in the majority of case they'd almost always turn into a string. After this we consistently return a string as it would be passed in the `_changes?since=...` parameter.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-16T15:34:45Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T23:01:38Z","closed_at":"2022-09-17T23:01:36Z","merged_at":"2022-09-17T23:01:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"21eebad0fb6ea62786d915b29797983be537908a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/372615df02fc96e90412d0ac361ef0053e0fb578","head":{"label":"apache:improve-replicator-sequence-handling","ref":"improve-replicator-sequence-handling","sha":"372615df02fc96e90412d0ac361ef0053e0fb578","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

By that point `get_start_seq/2` should have transformed `\"now\"` into a proper sequence so it's confusing validating that case as passing.

on Github\" link wasn't working and pointing to a non-existent \"index\" file. This was most likely because we override the index.html template, so the  source renderer doesn't know what to link it to. Instead opt to make the top level \"Edit on Github\" point the docs readme page. Individual doc pages will point to their respective source pages.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we were quite a bit behind on on the sphinx version 1.5 vs 5.1.1 this has caused quite a bit of headaches over the years as we had to pin jinja2, docutils and other libraries versions to avoid breaking things.\r\n\r\nThe main issue after the upgrade was that the http domain became a bit more strict. After vendoring it in, we had to make a few multipart http examples use plaintext. On the positive side, it found broken references in the admin guide, so those were fixed. Since we're using the latest 5.1.1 opt to just use a python3 venv with a short setup.sh script. That should make it easier for contributors to build docs locally.","created_at":"2022-09-12T17:00:11Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T02:50:25Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T02:50:22Z","merged_at":"2022-09-13T02:50:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1b7ce6370621634ebab4e27218654efac059472","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/c0c98297a94573eb01a6fb0beb993576baebf950","head":{"label":"apache:try-to-fix-docs-edit-link","ref":"try-to-fix-docs-edit-link","sha":"c0c98297a94573eb01a6fb0beb993576baebf950","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

to the discussion in [dev ML](https://lists.apache.org/thread/x4lc6vhthj1vkt2xpd0ox5osh959qsc4)\r\n\r\nThe main advantage for doing it are:\r\n  * No need to create a separate PR for features. Less efforts to update docs.\r\n  * Make it easier to generate releases. Release notes track source changes.\r\n  * Speed up `./configure` as there one less dependency to fetch.\r\n  \r\nOne of the objections of this approach, as discussed in the ML, was that docs PRs have a lightweight CI and we'd want to preserve that. This PR attempts to address that with the changes to the `Jenkinsfile.pr` (thanks to @big-r81 for the idea in the ML) where the following logic is used in the `when ...` stage triggers.\r\n   * If any docs files are changed, run docs `make check` (a quick format check for docs)\r\n   * If only docs changed, then docs `make` is run, like in the previous separate docs repo. All the other CI steps are skipped.\r\n   * If other files are changed, not just docs, then the full CI is run. As part of that `make dist` also builds docs. If this happens there is not need to also run the \"Build Docs\" so that can be skipped.","created_at":"2022-09-07T04:19:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T17:59:58Z","closed_at":"2022-09-09T04:26:42Z","merged_at":"2022-09-09T04:26:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae948725c053cef443df61d22e81ec09edec0ede","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/1907b0bd40f7d4b74b069e38167613a18973e0c6","head":{"label":"apache:integrate-docs-2","ref":"integrate-docs-2","sha":"1907b0bd40f7d4b74b069e38167613a18973e0c6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Reuse the same algorithm used when skipping calls to `_bulk_get` if there are too many attachments to statistically start skipping calls to `_revs_diff`.\r\n\r\nAlso use the same record for keeping

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses a bug that is described in issue #2496 where posting an all docs query to a partition endpoint with keys that are not a part of the partition also gets returned.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nConsider the following documents, each in their own partition on a database named `test`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"rows\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"id\": \"part1:doc1\",\r\n            \"key\": \"part1:doc1\",\r\n            \"value\": {\r\n                \"rev\": \"5-aa9d2b82de6db1e61fba8e4057299d21\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"id\": \"part2:doc1\",\r\n            \"key\": \"part2:doc1\",\r\n            \"value\": {\r\n                \"rev\": \"3-a707bb62c86bd430389e4d596aeb6084\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we run the following query against the `part2` partition:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:15984/test/_partition/part2/_all_docs \\\r\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n    -d '{\"keys\":[\"part1:doc1\", \"part2:doc1\"]}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get **_both documents from both partitions_**, but what we expect should look like this\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"rows\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"key\": \"part1:doc1\",\r\n            \"error\": \"not_found\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n        \"id\": \"part2:doc1\",\r\n            \"key\": \"part2:doc1\",\r\n            \"value\": {\r\n                \"rev\": \"3-a707bb62c86bd430389e4d596aeb6084\"\r\n            }\r\n       }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR

main goal is to test the clustered (chttpd/fabric) endpoints instead of the local (backend) versions. This is a more realistic test scenario since that's the API used most often in practice.\r\n\r\nBesides switching to chttpd and fabric, also remove the extra cruft left from when we had `local` and `remote` test flavors. After a previous refactoring only the `remote` version remained, but a lot of scaffolding in the form of a parameterized `foreachx` test generators was left behind. \r\n\r\nAlso, the majority of replication tests were using a similar set of setup and teardown functions, so those were moved to the common test helper module.\r\n\r\nAlmost all test modules benefited from the removal of the `?_test(begin...end)` construct and switched to using the `TDEF_FE` macro which makes the test definition and implementation of tests easier to read and saves an indentation level, which is always nice to have.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to review, the PR is structured as a bunch of smaller individual commits - one per test module, starting with test helpers in `couch_replicator_test_helper`. Each test module then has its own commit with comments summarizing the changes.\r\n\r\nAnother note for the reviewer is that all the changes are only in the `test/eunit` subfolder and no `src` modules were altered.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-19T02:12:20Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T17:29:27Z","closed_at":"2022-08-19T17:19:00Z","merged_at":"2022-08-19T17:18:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6db35b6b5737a7397e10758a87c06c10f729200","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4151/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4151/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4151/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/729e52faec53ff7aab0f1c8f0c6010d1628fef75","head":{"label":"apache:refactor-replication-tests","ref":"refactor-replication-tests","sha":"729e52faec53ff7aab0f1c8f0c6010d1628fef75","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

The current config uses outdated dependencies and does not work out of the box.\r\n\r\nHere are the updates:\r\n\r\n- Use volume mount instead of bind to improve performance and help solve #4145 \r\n- Updated `README` and `README-DEV` to include quick buttons/links to spin up devcontainer\r\n- Automatically run `./configure && make` during container creation\r\n\r\n## Testing performed to validate dev container...\r\n\r\nClick the button below to automatically spin up a devcontainer on your local machine.\r\n\r\n(this demo button uses [zachlankton/couchdb-test](https://github.com/zachlankton/couchdb-test) repo to show how the button will work once this PR is merged into main)\r\n\r\n[![Open in Remote -

the container is finished setting up (will take some time due to automatically running `./configure && make` run the following commands to verify everything works:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./dev/run\r\n# or ./dev/run --admin=admin:admin\r\n# or ./dev/run --with-admin-party-please\r\n\r\n# login to http://localhost:15984/_utils/\r\n# make a db and some docs\r\n# run the \"Verify Install\"\r\n\r\n# CTRL-C

now most of the CouchDB implementations support `_bulk_get`, so let's update the replicator to take advantage of that.\r\n\r\nTo be backwards compatible assume some endpoints will not support `_bulk_get` and may return either a 500 or 400 error. In that case the replicator will fall back to fetching individual document revisions like it did previously. For additional backward compatibility, and to keep things simple, support only the `application/json` `_bulk_get` response format. (Ideally, we'd send multiple Accept headers with various `q` preference parameters for `json` and `multipart/related` content, then do the right thing based on the response, however, none of the recent Apache CouchDB implementations support that scheme properly).\r\n\r\nSince fetching attachments with `application/json` response is not optimal, attachments are fetched individually. This means there are two main reasons for the replicator to fall back to fetching individual revisions: 1) when `_bulk_get` endpoint is not supported and 2) when the document revisions contain attachments.\r\n\r\nTo avoid wasting resource repeatedly attempting to use `_bulk_get `and then falling back to individual doc fetches, maintain some historical stats about the rate of failure, and if it crosses a threshold, skip calling `_bulk_get` altogether. This is implemented with a moving exponential average, along with periodic probing to see if `_bulk_get` usage becomes viable again.\r\n\r\nTo give the users some indication about how successful `_bulk_get` usage is, introduce two replication statistics parameters:\r\n  * `bulk_get_attempts`: `_bulk_get` document revisions attempts made.\r\n  * `bulk_get_docs` : `_bulk_get` document revisions successfully retrieved.\r\n\r\nThese are persisted in the replication checkpoints along with the rest of the job statistics and visible in `_scheduler/jobs` and `_active_tasks` output.\r\n\r\nSince we updated the replication job statistics, perform some minor cleanups in that area:\r\n  - Stop using the process dictionary for the reporting timestamp. Use a regular record state field instead.\r\n  - Use casts instead of a calls when possible. We still rely on `report_seq_done` calls as a synchronization point to make sure we don't overrun the message queues for the replication worker and scheduler job process.\r\n  - Add stats update API functions instead of relying on naked `gen_server` calls and casts. The functions make it clear which process is being updated: the replication worker or the main replication scheduler job process.\r\n\r\nFor testing, rely on the variety of existing replication tests running and passing. The recently merged replication test overhaul from [pull #4151](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4151) switched most of the tests form using the node-local (back-end API) to chttpd (the clustering API), which actually implements `_bulk_get`. In this way, the majority of replication tests should test the `_bulk_get` API usage alongside whatever else they are testing.

is a 2022 rebase of #3038 with many comments on that PR addressed.\r\n\r\nThis is still a WIP\r\n\r\n## Overview \r\nThis PR introduces the long-awaited first iteration of the per-doc-access-control feature (_access) for short.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this feature is to make the db-per-user pattern obsolete and allow mutually untrusting users _access_ to the _same_ database.\r\n\r\nTo recap, the downsides of the db-per-user pattern are:\r\n- additional management is needed to create, secure and remove database(s) corresponding to a user’s lifecycle. the peruser add-on helps with this, but it is not always sufficient.\r\n- in order to support the _very common_ requirement of running a query across all per-user databases, all those databases need to be replicating into a central database (or other target). This adds significant CPU and IOPS resource usage to a CouchDB.\r\n- in large installations, most per-user databases will be very small (<100kb) leading to an unfavourable file-descriptor to data-accessed ratio.\r\n- additional tuning is needed to make compaction behave safely in this scenario.\r\n- there’s probably more… \r\n\r\n\r\nAn _access-enabled database has these properties.\r\n\r\n- each user can only read and write their own documents\r\n- each user gets _changes and _all_docs responses scoped to only their own documents\r\n- admins can still access all documents, and create views across all documents for analysis\r\n\r\nIn future iterations, the _access feature could allow documents to be owned by multiple users, and groups, plus differentiation of readonly and rewrite permissions for each, and per-user-views, but that’s TBD for the scope of this initial PR, however provisions have been made to make this possible.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nThe fundamental addition to the CouchDB API is threefold.\r\n\r\nFirst, a database can be _access-enabled_ at creation time. It is not possible to make an existing database access-capable. You can create a an access-enabled database with `PUT /db?access=true` (final option name to be bikeshet).\r\n\r\nSecond, the introduction of a new top-level document property `_access: [\"username\"]`. The current implementation requires non-admins to write docs that have this property. Docs without it are rejected (unless an admin writes them). The username in the first array element MUST match the user_ctx of any document CRUD request.\r\n\r\nThird, for access-enabled databases, both `_changes` and `_all_docs` now include a switch:\r\n\r\n1. admin users go straight to the existing `by-seq` and `by-id` indexes, just as before.\r\n2. non-admin users are directed to a new internal view that includes two sections, one corresponding to `by-seq` and one to `by-id`, but with the `username` from the `_access` property as a prefix. These indexes then are queried with the `user` property from the request’s `user_ctx` as hardcoded `startkey`/`endkey`.\r\n\r\nThis new internal view is implemented by way of [a new query server](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4139/commits/6f991fdc3aa5b6ff418f2fccd39abd7c74a9a3be) that is somewhat modelled after the mango query server (reusing couch_index/couch_mrview as much as possible).\r\n\r\nThe consequence here is that a non-access-enabled databases should behave no different than before in all aspects API and operational.\r\n\r\nEach user also now gets a new internal role `_user` automatically appended to their list of roles to simplify access control setup. If a databases has this role in its `_security` object, it means: each authenticated user can access the database.\r\n\r\nThe replicator has been expanded to create replication checkpoints with an `_access` property as well. External replication clients like PouchDB will have to be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nI tried to make the PR easy to follow with logical commits to each section of CouchDB + some cleanup at the end. I suggest once satisfactory, this should be squashed into a single commit with an updated version of this PR text as the commit message.\r\n\r\nThe access feature can be globally disabled by server config.\r\n\r\nThis feature should work well with partitioned databases (in fact the combination should be a great benefit), but this has not yet been verified.\r\n\r\n## Implementation State\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with extensive tests covering all desired behaviour and it works and passes all tests.\r\n\r\nThere are a few cosmetic things to be discussed (all are already comments to this PR).\r\n\r\nThere is a performance regression in this PR that still has to be investigated, but it _might_ be addressed by changing the current PR-behaviour in one detail. See [this comment for more details about handling conflicted docs](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4139#discussion_r939533587).\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\nDepending on how hard it is to do this correctly, we may or may not include expanding the `_access` property. It is designed to hold a list of users and groups that have access to a document. We will have to think through the consequences a bit more, but it _might_ be that the only two things that are needed are:\r\n\r\n1. expand the access query server to index the whole `_access` property and add a row for the doc for each entry\r\n2. expand the doc CRUD validation to look at all entries in the whole `_access` property.\r\n\r\nBut if this proves to complicated, I’m okay with merging this PR with out multi-user and group support.\r\n\r\nWe might also want to add `readonly` and `readwrite` tags to `_access` entries for even more fine-grained access control.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not yet include “users can create views on their share of the database”, but I’d like to add this feature eventually.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThere is a [corresponding RFC](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/pull/424/files) that still needs updating and has comments that have not been addressed yet. My goal is to produce and up-to-date RFC by the time this PR is ready to merge.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. I’d like a wieder review of this to see if there are any obvious places that need addressing.\r\n2. I’d like to nail down the remaining design question about [conflicted docs](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4139#pullrequestreview-1064311216).\r\n3. I’d like to find the performance regression.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-06T14:11:12Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T15:10:23Z","closed_at":"2023-07-12T15:10:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c108b87f4c07081d814167297e59ae92dfbcc3a5","assignee":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4139/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4139/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4139/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/841bc3830f5ef49c29284a8ef1a8112ca3cbd534","head":{"label":"apache:feat/access-2022","ref":"feat/access-2022","sha":"841bc3830f5ef49c29284a8ef1a8112ca3cbd534","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nMost of the code editors select syntax highlighting language based on file name extension. However, this approach doesn't work when the extension is not standard. For such cases, there are magic lines. Without the magic lines, files with unknown extensions require extra steps to enable syntax highlighting and auto-completion. This PR adds a magic line for Vim.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nOpen Emacs or Vim and ensure that it uses Erlang syntax highlighting for `rebar.config*` files.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.
