SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nComing out of some discussion from https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/10179 the flag `LIST_VIEWS_NEW_UI` is quite confusing as to what it's refering to. \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the flag to be more semantically correct, `LIST_VIEWS_SIP34_FILTER_UI` and adds a comment on `ENABLE_REACT_CRUD_VIEWS` flag pointing to SIP-34.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdd Explore Database to CTAS/CVAS visualization flow. Enables table creation in one database and visualization in another [e.g. hive -> presto ]. This change will help speed up the time spent on visualization workflows [e.g. after running a 1-2 hour hive query to create a table you can then use presto to visualize it ].\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

will make allow the admin to set up a root connection that can be impersonated.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIf a root Hive connection is used liked in Hue, we want to simply impersonate that single connection to allow Apache Sentry/Ranger to manage user rights regarding databases/tables. If we enforce the auth param, we also are forced to set credentials on that connection, although we want to use a dedicated hive-server and connection in combination with Apache Sentry/Range, similar to Hue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nSet up an unprotected Hive server and add that connection.\r\n```\r\nhive://myhive01.example:10000\r\n```\r\nSelect impersonation.\r\nWithout the auth flags (eG the submitted fix) Superset is able to impersonate the connection properly.\r\nIf the auth setting is set (eG to LDAP or Kerberos) Superset expects username:password in the connection string, although it is not required.\r\n\r\nTo verify the correct behavior, set the connection, check impersonation, and do not modify the `Extra` settings.\r\nAn open connection should still be able to impersonate the connection.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIntroduces Database level configuration for the visibility of the \"Explore\" button seen in the query

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR made several changes to Cypress tests:\r\n\r\n- #### Upgrade Cypress to 4.7.0\r\n  Some E2E tests has been flaky, especially with the \"should apply filter\" test in dashboard (never ran into an issue while debugging locally, but fails from time to time in CI). I'm reluctant to disable/skip it as it does feel important. Let's see if upgrading Cypress fixes it.\r\n\r\n- #### Re-enable visualization tests\r\n  End-to-end tests for editing visualizations have been disabled for some time ([most likely unintentionally](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9490#discussion_r406502040)). Let's reenable it to ensure the safety of charting experience.\r\n\r\n  Also fixed a couple of broken tests.\r\n\r\n- #### Split tests into independent `.test.js` files\r\n  The [original intention of combining all tests](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6019) in a `index.test.js` file was to speed things up because of overhead of starting Chrome for each file. But it has been verified that latest Cypress has no such overhead.\r\n   \r\n   This change will make debugging a specific test easier.\r\n  \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI should pass\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis makes the code cleaner and fixes missing theme variables when `npm link @superset-ui/style`.\r\n\r\nWebpack somehow has independent namespaces for regular JS modules and those in soft-linked `node_modules`, so `import { styled } from '@superset-ui/style'` and `import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming` will access different cached themes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nManual testing, expect styled components used `theme` variables correctly load when `npm link ~/projects/superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-style` and `npm run dev`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen using tox to individually test core_tests.py (ie. tox -e py37 -- tests/core_tests.py) an Attribute Error occurs because superset.views.utils is imported before tests.test_app.app. I changed the import order of these in order to get rid of the error and allow core_tests.py to be run

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently Python unit tests via `nosetests` always output test coverage, but there's no way to disable it. The very long coverage report is quite annoying and makes it more difficult to scan test errors, especially when you just want to run a single test.\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThough both the [`Database`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/8e23d4f369f35724b34b14def8a5a8bafb1d2ecb/superset/models/core.py#L99) and [`DruidCluster`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/8e23d4f369f35724b34b14def8a5a8bafb1d2ecb/superset/connectors/druid/models.py#L122) have a `perm` property (which is merely a concatenation of either the database or cluster name and record ID), the property only maps to a physical column for the `Database` model. \r\n\r\nThe `perm` column exists is so various permission based queries can be executed to determine if a user can access said data entities. The reason it is not a physical column for the `DruidCluster` model is probably an oversight as this logic is rarely used. Note this PR addresses the inconsistency.\r\n\r\nRather than storing the `perm` in the database I thought there was merit in deprecating the `dbs.perm` column and replacing it with a SQLAlchemy [hybrid attribute](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/extensions/hybrid.html#defining-expression-behavior-distinct-from-attribute-behavior). These hybrid attributes act like virtual columns and function in both Python and SQL (a SQL expression has been provided to deal with the casting of the `id` column to a string). If people are ok with these hybrid attributes I wonder if there's merit in deprecating all of the physical `perm` columns.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nSo somehow that link is using the `KV` model, and is broken when `KV_STORE = False`.\r\n\r\nWhy is that link using `KV` (the generic key/value model)? Well I think originally it just passed `?db_id={db_id}&sql={sql_string}`, but the SQL string can be too long as a GET param, so I'm guessing someone (maybe me, though I don't recall, didn't bother using `git blame` to see the history here), decided to push the query info to KV and reference it instead. Not sure why, probably to mimic the \"share query\" feature (?). Anyhow, here I decided to just pass the query id and let the frontend do the work.\r\n\r\nAlso did some minor cosmetic adjustements\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

a database from a JSON file, the process\r\nlooks at the database name from the source (the info is in the file)\r\nand matches the datasources to that name. If no database by that name\r\nexists, it simply fails.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we add a database dropdown that allows the user to specify\r\nwhich databases the datasources should target as the get upserted.\r\n\r\nI want to stress that the code in this area is not in a great shape,\r\nand that the challenge of serializing/deser the nested objects is\r\nchallenging, but that there should be a much better way to do this.\r\nOne of the improvement (out of scope for this PR) that would allow to\r\nsimplify those import/export would be to use UUIDs for\r\nimportable/exportable objects.\r\n\r\nAnother identified issue is the indirections between\r\n`utils/import_expor_{model}.py` on top of `{Model}.import_object`. Not\r\naddressing that here.\r\n\r\nNext topic is the MVC stuff. Decided to stick with it for now as this is\r\nmore of a [obious missing feat:] than a rewrite.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a collection of small dependency related fixes:\r\n- `cachelib==0.1` doesn't work correctly on Windows (see https://github.com/pallets/cachelib/pull/12 ). While Superset doesn't officially support Windows, it is known to be used in production. The maintainers of `cachelib` were kind enough to release `0.1.1` containing the fix, hence this bump.\r\n- `sqlalchemy-utils==0.36.5` had a regression which caused `EncryptedType` to stop working (see https://github.com/kvesteri/sqlalchemy-utils/issues/444 ). Bumping to  `0.36.6` fixes the problem. However, starting from `0.36.6` the `EncryptedType` is deprecated, and will be migrated to the new `StringEncryptedType` in an upcoming version, hence restricting to `<0.37`. Once the new `StringEncryptedType` becomes stable, we need to migrate to it to stay on the latest stable version.\r\n- `requirements.txt` was not regenerated when support for slack was added, leading to some missing dependencies (see #9810 ). While regenerating the file for the above bumps, these were also pulled in.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing + CI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nWe used to be able to show filtered vs all data in the same chart by using annotation. See below is an example, region vs global.\r\n\r\nBut I recently found there was an issue introduced by #8057, where dashboard filter (**extra_filters** param) is applied to chart's annotation layer. This will cause chart and annotation layer both have same query, so we can't compare filtered data vs original annotation layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR is try to fix this issue, not passing dashboard filter parameters to chart's annotation layer.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**before:**\r\n<img width=\"1264\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-20 at 1 02 36 AM\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR combines two major updates for the table chart:\r\n\r\n1. Replace its rendering from `jquery.DataTables` to `react-table`: apache-superset/superset-ui#623\r\n2. Rearrange the control panel, replace GROUP BY and NOT GROUP BY with a \"Query Mode\" switch: apache-superset/superset-ui#609 . It was not super clear what do GROUP BY and NOT GROUP BY mean and that they are mutually exclusive. Adding a tab switch should make things a little bit easier to understand.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there are also some smaller refactoring and UX improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Clean up the legacy backend API for TableViz, add support for a new `query_mode` field.\r\n2. Refactor control panel config management\r\n3. Change default customize options for table chart\r\n   - Time format now defaults to smartDate, which formats the time column based on time grain\r\n   - Page length now defaults to NULL, which automatically add pagination of 200 rows per page when number of cells > 10,000\r\n\r\nMust wait for release of new versions of `@superset-ui/chart-controls` and `@superset-ui/plugin-chart-table`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nInitial report:\r\n> \"Filter widgets don't show a \"\"loading\"\" spinner, so there is no indication of when the (valid) filter values are loaded. This is a problem with dynamic filters where the underlying logic that returns the filter values can change, or where they depend on settings for other values. The only way to see when it's been updated is by examining the drop-down values to see when they've changed (or if you know what to expect, when the correct values are shown).\r\n\r\nIssue uncovered:\r\nThe loader was indeed there, but buried (z-index-wise) below the controls.\r\n\r\nThe fix:\r\nCould this be fixed with one line of CSS? Yep! But that's not the _right_ way. This PR does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Reverses the rendering order of the three key layers in `chart.jsx` so the Loader is atop the Refresh overlay atop the Chart itself. Not sure why it would be the other way, but if anyone has some idea, let me know!\r\n\r\n2. Touches up a bunch of CSS to make the positioning of those re-stacked elements work\r\n\r\n3. Moves the CSS out of LESS and into Emotion üë©‚Äçüé§\r\n\r\n4. Migrates `Loading` and `RefreshChartOverlay` components to tsx.\r\n\r\n5. Removes the `size` prop from Loading, which sure seems to be unused\r\n\r\n6. Removes some unused css for a \"dismiss\" button that no longer seems to exist.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![captured

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n- changes styles and pagination to match SIP-34. Datasets was the target but made a few changes to chartList and dashboardList since changes needed to be made to the underlying listview component. \r\n- Improves loading of the listview. The listview doesn't render until data is fetched and fetching new data uses a skeleton shimmer loading effect. \r\n- adds tooltips (dataset type, last modified, actions, owners)\r\n- adds column option for fixed size.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n<img width=\"3008\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 3 23 21 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen working on a visualization in Explore, if there were changes to the visualization that had not been \"run\" via the \"Run Query\" button, they would be lost when editing the related datasource via the modal on the page.\r\n\r\nWhy? The reducer that updated the `form_data` when a form component changed was broken in such a way that it would update the control settings to make the change visible, but not the `form_data` settings to make the change durable.\r\n\r\nThis PR retains the behavior of not updating the encoded data in the URL until the \"Run Query\" button is pressed.\r\n\r\n**Question for the community**: are there any tests for any of the reducers in Superset? Can someone point me to an example? I'd love to write some tests for this change to avoid a regression.\r\n\r\nAlso, big props to @nytai for walking me through the Explore front-end code and helping me track this one down.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe issue was first observed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7270\r\nHowever, in the subsequent releases, the variable **time_grain_functions** was renamed to **_time_grain_expressions**. The implementation was also left out for hive. So time functions were not renamed which were specific to Hive. This was causing the group by functions in the Charts to malfunction\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe file `superset/views/core.py` is massive, to the point that I get lost in there all the time when I'm working on something. There's no need for us to stuff so much functionality into a single Python module. This PR tackles some low-hanging fruit for breaking up this file, moving out a few pieces that are logically separate from the elephant in the room: the `Superset` class.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that in a near-future PR I'll be able to start breaking up some of the larger functions in the `Superset` catch-all, but I wanted to get the community's reaction to these changes first.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nCI!

SUMMARY\r\nThis is an ad hoc script for regenerating the content of issue #10004. I'm committing it to the repo so that anyone can run it, and so that i don't need to keep ignoring it from my future PRs. This will be deleted once everything is migrated over to TypeScript.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect any application code, so this is still in JS (writing/running one-off scripts in TS is still somewhat tricky to get right, so i figured this was easiest)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFlask returns a 404 when a route doesn't match it's signature. `/superset/queries/1588736634550.6` was returning 404 due to the `<int:last_updated_ms>` syntax since the requested endpoint contains a float. \r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the typing logic introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9939/files#diff-ac978615a4f22c4fad4d01f39e1d4595L2646 in favor of the custom int parsing logic that was in palce before. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nIf a viz plugin doesn't provide a `buildQuery` function, exporting charts (JSON, CSV) fails.\r\n\r\n(FYI: this code will soon be replaced with `ChartClient` from `@superset-ui/chart`, hence not adding tests for this).\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + local testing by verifying that old+new charts render properly on dashboards and Explore mode, and that all export options still work (CSV, JSON, Samples, Query).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nWhen loading a recently loaded chart with a relative time range and a time compare selected, the chart renders with the \"cached\" icons, but it clearly takes far too long to load (like a minute compared to the usual half a second for a cached chart. After investigation, it looks like the cache key isn't consistent for relative time range time compare extra queries. This fixes that issue\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + new unit tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

the new `@brand-primary` color!\r\n- [x] text on `btn-sm` isn't aligned, the new font we use isn't aligned with the pixels it reserves\r\n- [ ] SIP-34 primary and secondary buttons don't look good in button groups where it's unclear where one button and the next starts. I think we'll be moving away from using `btn-group` and have buttons side by side (with a gap) and the extra buttons into dropdowns - but this requires touching layouts (not just CSS). Bootstrap offers `btn-primary` and `btn-default`, but no tierciary. For now I rolled with using what SIP-34 defines as tierciary on `btn-default` to work around the group issue \r\n- [x] SQL Lab tab headers are buttons but shouldn't be, as a result they got uppercased. We need to get them out of buttons","created_at":"2020-06-15T17:57:09Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T21:32:43Z","closed_at":"2020-06-18T22:01:59Z","merged_at":"2020-06-18T22:01:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6390afb8972f315a0e5c87e618e21708e596f36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently registering a `buildQuery` function with the `ChartBuildQueryRegistry` is mandatory for all V1 viz plugins. While a custom `buildQuery` is needed for advanced post processing operations, in the majority of cases this is not needed, as control values can be automatically grouped using the `queryField` control property. Using a default callback will make it easier to get started with viz plugin development, and reduce plugin boilerplate.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + new test with current pinned `superset-ui` dependencies. Also tested to work properly with the new word cloud plugin with and without a `buildQuery` callback.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis ports in changes made to `@superset-ui/plugin-chart-table` in\r\n- https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/556 and\r\n- https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/584\r\n\r\nwhich is a total rewrite of the table chart using [react-table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table). This should give us more performant data tables and help us get rid of `jquery.DataTables` and `jQuery`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/84419772-eeb97b80-abcd-11ea-8eaa-91472b0f1c81.png)\r\n\r\nThere should be no visible changes except things noted above:\r\n\r\n- Updated sort icons: `jquery.DataTables` has its own icons and they are not available in FontAwesome free edition. I'm using the same icons used by other places that are using `react-table`, except I'm importing them from [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) (SVG for the win!).\r\n- Changed defaults for page length and time column format:\r\n  - Use Adaptive Formatting based on granularity for time column\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/84423369-3262b400-abd3-11ea-91d1-af6fa4d4abf4.png)\r\n  - Set page length to null by default, which **automatically adds pagination when number of table cells (columns * rows) > 10,000**.\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/84424594-2b3ca580-abd5-11ea-9a0a-a4ef77e2af75.png)\r\n  - Changed the list of available page length options (people can still create their own, though)\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/84423735-c9c80700-abd3-11ea-912b-014a8e7176db.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n- Unit tests in superset-ui\r\n- E2E tests in sueprset-frontend\r\n\r\nFollowing use cases have been manually tested in Superset\r\n\r\n- Creating a new chart\r\n- Updating existing chart\r\n- Resize in Explore\r\n- Resize in dashboards\r\n- Charts with many many columns\r\n- Charts with Time column\r\n- Toggle different customize options\r\n- Setting and clearing page length option\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: see SUMMARY\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the security manager assertion logic making it more flexible for deployments to configure their security manager. Currently there exists two types of methods:\r\n\r\n1. `can_access_*`, e.g. `can_access_datasource`, which returns a boolean in response to whether the user can access said resource.\r\n2. `assert_*_permission`, e.g. `assert_datasource_permission`, which returns `None` but raises an exception if the user cannot access said resource.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this approach is that some methods like `access_datasource` have all the logic and `assert_datasource_permission` calls `can_access_datasource` and raises an exception if the response is `False`, whereas others like `can_access_table` have no assert equivalent. \r\n\r\nAdditional context as to why a user cannot access said resource is lost when the logic resides in the `can_access_*` and thus the preferred approach is to have the logic in the `assert_*_permission` method and thus the `can_access_*` methods (which are mostly just convenience methods) can take the form, \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef can_access_datasource(self, datasource) -> bool:\r\n    try:\r\n        self.assert_datasource_permission(datasource)\r\n    except SupersetSecurityException:\r\n        return False\r\n\r\n    return True\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote I‚Äôve only translated a few of the `can_access_*` methods. I think in the future it could make sense that more of these methods could leverage this pattern depending on how deployments with custom security managers would want to proceed.\r\n\r\nSecondly the term `assert` seems strange as one would expect it to raise an `AssertionError` if the assertion fails, whereas these methods raise a `SupersetSecurityException`, hence I opted for the `requests` approach (which uses `raise_for_status`) to call these methods `raise_for_access` and thus it seems clearer than an exception may be raised (and thus should be handled if necessary). I used the term `access` rather than `permission` for consistency with the `can_access_*` methods. I also added a wrapper function to various classes so rather than, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nquery_context = QueryContext(**json.loads(request.form[\"query_context\"]))\r\nsecurity_manager.assert_query_context_permission(query_context)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe logic is now, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nquery_context = QueryContext(**json.loads(request.form[\"query_context\"]))\r\nquery_context.raise_for_access()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally rather than having a slew of `raise_for_*_access` which can add to the confusion (and introduce unnecessary complexity) if a deployment needs to override these, i.e., they intrinsically need to know how these interact, I defined a single `raise_for_access` method which contains all the logic regardless of the resource type (table, datasource, visualization, etc.). This can be helpful say if a user cannot access to an outright datasource but due to column level security can access the datasource in the context of a visualization (where the columns are defined).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI and added unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the following: \r\n\r\n1. Ensures consistent naming of the \"access\" methods for the security manager, i.e., previously we had methods named `can_access_all_queries` and `all_datasource_access` (note the singular \"datasource\"). The former is prefer as the return type is implied. Note I believe the later existed for possible consistency with the underlying FAB per names, however this isn't a requirement per the `can_access_all_queries` example. The renaming is as follows:\r\n\r\n    - `can_access_datasource` -> `can_access_table` (more explicit and resolves naming conflict with the `datasource_access` rename)\r\n    - `all_datasource_access` -> `can_access_all_datasources` (plural)\r\n    - `all_database_access` -> `can_access_all_databases` (plural)\r\n    - `database_access` -> `can_access_database` \r\n    - `schema_access` -> `can_access_schema`\r\n    - `datasource_access` -> `can_access_datasource`\r\n\r\n2. The `can_access_table` (previously named `can_access_datasource`) method signature has changed. The optional schema argument no longer exists as it is defined within the `Table` object.\r\n \r\n3. Removes unnecessary checks, i.e., previous logic was in the form, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nif security_manager.database_access(database) or security_manager.all_datasource_access():\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever the `database_access` method (now named `can_access_database`) first checks whether the user can access all datasources (per [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/91517a56a3bcacd4c8f2dca233d8df248bfca10e/superset/security/manager.py#L241)) and thus the second check is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER
