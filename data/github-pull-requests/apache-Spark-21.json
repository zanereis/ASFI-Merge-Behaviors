What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47817 we added new SQL functions `zeroifnull` and `nullifzero`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we add Scala and Python DataFrame API endpoints for them.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Scala:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar df = Seq((0)).toDF(\"a\")\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"nullifzero(0)\").collect()\r\n> null\r\ndf.select(nullifzero(lit(0))).collect()\r\n> null\r\n\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"nullifzero(a)\").collect()\r\n> null\r\ndf.select(nullifzero(lit(5))).collect()\r\n> 5\r\n\r\ndf = Seq[(Integer)]((null)).toDF(\"a\")\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"zeroifnull(null)\").collect()\r\n> 5\r\ndf.select(nullifzero(lit(null))).collect()\r\n> 0\r\n\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"zeroifnull(a)\").collect()\r\n> 0\r\ndf.select(zeroifnull(lit(5)))\r\n> 5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves DataFrame parity with the SQL API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd unit test to for RocksDB state store snapshot checkpointing for changelog. We intentionally add the same content in each batch, so that it is likely that SST files generated are all of the same size. We have some randomness on loading the existing version or move to the next, and whether maintenance task is executed. All three tests would fail for previous versions but not in master. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently we discovered some RocksDB state store file version ID mismatch issues. Although it happens to have been fixed by other change, we don't have test coverage for it. Add unit tests for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun the tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR allows `StagedTableCatalog#create/replaceTable` to return null and Spark will fall back to normal non-atomic write.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExtending an interface is static but sometimes the implementations need more dynamicity. For example, a catalog may only support atomic CTAS for certain table formats, and we shouldn't force them to implement atomic writes for all other formats.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe same principle as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47825#pullrequestreview-2250729020, the parameters (`left` and `right`) in expression `levenshtein` are `collation-dependent`, rather than `collation-unaware`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStrengthen the parameter data type check of expression `levenshtein`  to avoid potential issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add some `test case` to `collations.sql`.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-22T11:40:25Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T05:26:19Z","closed_at":"2024-08-27T05:26:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"026c80eca43a405f44654902a67a89e5e8b9136d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47847/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47847/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47847/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71220dba4ff9e3801ddea3bcbf345fab5920af77","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-49355","ref":"SPARK-49355","sha":"71220dba4ff9e3801ddea3bcbf345fab5920af77","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the PR, I propose to rename the legacy error classes `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_32[09-14]` to `ILLEGAL_DAY_OF_WEEK`, `INVALID_INTERVAL_FORMAT.[SECOND_NANO_FORMAT, DAY_TIME_PARSING, UNSUPPORTED_FROM_TO_EXPRESSION, INTERVAL_PARSING, UNMATCHED_FORMAT_STRING]` and modifying their error messages properly. Also, I propose modifying the test that checks `INVALID_INTERVAL_FORMAT.DAY_TIME_PARSING` in a way that it also checks error class and sql state. Furthermore, I propose to add tests which check whether the exceptions `INVALID_INTERVAL_FORMAT.SECOND_NANO_FORMAT` and `INVALID_INTERVAL_FORMAT. UNSUPPORTED_FROM_TO_EXPRESSION ` are thrown properly. Additionally, I propose to keep the query context of these exceptions in golden files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIt was tested by modifying existing tests in `IntervalUtilsSuite`, `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DDLParserSuite` and `CastSuiteBase` classes. Tests were modified to check modified names and sql states. Additionally, test for checking `INVALID_INTERVAL_FORMAT.SECOND_NANO_FORMAT` and `INVALID_INTERVAL_FORMAT.UNSUPPORTED_FROM_TO_EXPRESSION` exceptions were added in `IntervalUtilsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe same principle as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47825#pullrequestreview-2250729020, the parameter `delimiter` in expression `split_part` are treated as (`collation-dependent`) delimiters, rather than (`collation-unaware`) regular expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStrengthen the parameter data type check of expression `split_part`  to avoid potential issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add some `test case` to `collations.sql`.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to update the related docs after `encoding` and `decoding` support `UTF-32`,  includes:\r\n- the `doc` of the sql config `spark.sql.legacy.javaCharsets`\r\n- connector/connect/client/jvm/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala\r\n- sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala\r\n- python/pyspark/sql/functions/builtin.py\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter the pr https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46469, `UTF-32` for string encoding and decoding is already supported, but some related documents have not been updated synchronously. \r\nLet's update it to avoid misunderstandings for end-users and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids `ArrayTransform` in `resolveArrayType` function if the resolution expression is the same as input param.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOur customer encounters significant performance regression when migrating from Spark 3.2 to Spark 3.4 on a `Insert Into` query which is analyzed as a `AppendData` on an Iceberg table.\r\nWe found that the root cause is in Spark 3.4, `TableOutputResolver` resolves the query with additional `ArrayTransform` on an `ArrayType` field. The `ArrayTransform`'s lambda function is actually an identical function, i.e., the transformation is redundant.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test and manual e2e test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR moves the sql Column to sql/api. A (foreseen) consequence of this is that we need to move the Spark Connect Scala Client to the shared API. This makes the PR quite large.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to create a Scala Client interface that is shared between Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nConnect does no support untyped Scala UDFs until we figure out a solution for the conf system.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMostly existing tests. I had to change a couple of tests on the connect side:\r\n- UDAF related tests used a feature that was not supposed to work in the first place. You could use a typed aggregator on an untyped Dataset (Row). I have added a test for the scenario where you use an untyped aggregator on an untyped dataset.\r\n- In some cases the shared Column API generates slightly different structures (more/less arguments, different names, or different structure). The verbatims used by `PlanGenerationTestSuite` and `ProtoToParsedPlanTestSuite` were updated to reflect this. The protos that had non trivial changes were renamed with the `_orphaned` suffix, this to make sure we keep testing plans produced by older clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-22T02:06:00Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T18:09:44Z","closed_at":"2024-08-23T18:09:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00475c502319461603c7fa5ae8270daf57f884bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b40295a6e2fe2ccaf7268f09270dc17ebdc8e25f","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-49027","ref":"SPARK-49027","sha":"b40295a6e2fe2ccaf7268f09270dc17ebdc8e25f","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make sure using the current running Spark Session.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf users use `SparkSession.active()` or `SQLConf.get`, then it might pick up wrong configurations from a different Spark session. The current codebase is not affected so this is more for safety in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot added because the current codebase is not affected. This is just more for completeness.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

These methods now correctly follow the iterative \"longest possible match\" behaviour (proposed for StringTrim in the original PR).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix a subtle bug in `trim`-like functions.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\ntrim(\"ii\\u0307\", \"İi\"); -- returns: \"\\u0307\" (wrong), instead of \"\" (correct)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, trim* function behaviour is slightly altered for UTF8_LCASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-21T22:27:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T12:43:42Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T13:12:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dffb24a9fd92e91f2cb22eb545233033c369f4f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b31e3766a4f2a2b79d892271a6c61ed05c245fed","head":{"label":"uros-db:alter-trim-followup","ref":"alter-trim-followup","sha":"b31e3766a4f2a2b79d892271a6c61ed05c245fed","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR make the `TO_AVRO` SQL function `jsonFormatSchema` argument optional.\r\n\r\nFor example, now it is possible to just call it with a single input argument:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table t as\r\n  select named_struct('u', named_struct('member0', member0, 'member1', member1)) as s\r\n  from values (1, null), (null,  'a') tab(member0,

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test coverge.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `Spark Deamon`s support `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled` via system property via globally `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Dspark.log.structuredLogging.enabled=false sbin/start-master.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, their own environment variables are supported too.\r\n- Spark Master: `SPARK_MASTER_OPTS`\r\n- Spark Worker: `SPARK_WORKER_OPTS`\r\n- Spark History Server: `SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS `\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled` is ignored in deamons like Spark Master, Spark Worker, Spark History Server while the interactive shells and SparkThriftServer respect it.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFrom the implementation logic of expression `str_to_map`, we found that it only extracts `collation` of the first parameter `text` for the `next`

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAbbreviating a protobuf message is ineffective if the message is very deeply nested, causing a serious performance problem when converting the message into a string. This PR adds a new parameter, maxLevel, to ProtoUtils.abbreviate which limits the maximum nesting level to abbreviate and truncate any data that is below the level. As a result, ProtoUtils.abbreviate may return a partial protobuf message in case the message is deeply nested and a small value of maxLevel is supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\"truncate nested message\" added to AbbreviateSuite.scala.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR creates new SQL functions `zeroifnull` and `nullifzero`.\r\n\r\nThese are equivalent to `nvl(input, 0)` and `if(input = 0, null, input)`, respectively. The analyzer performs these replacements inline in this PR to take advantage of existing query optimizations for `nvl` and `if` expressions.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> select zeroifnull(null);\r\n 0\r\n> select zeroifnull(2);\r\n 2\r\n\r\n> select nullifzero(0);\r\n null\r\n> select nullifzero(2);\r\n 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe are adding these functions for compatibility with other systems which also have these SQL functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-20T17:57:43Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T05:20:03Z","closed_at":"2024-08-22T05:20:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"115f728f4068f82e6024aae1a7ece4640def5834","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47817/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47817/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47817/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e4b576d9cc1e78a323f91c5881b7dc606f45a54","head":{"label":"dtenedor:zeroifnull","ref":"zeroifnull","sha":"0e4b576d9cc1e78a323f91c5881b7dc606f45a54","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nMove class `MockObserver` from the Spark Connect Server's test folder to the Server's main folder, so that this class can be shaded as well, from `io.grpc` to `org.sparkproject.connect.grpc`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ba208b9ca99990fa329c36b28d0aa2a5f4d0a77e/project/SparkBuild.scala#L775\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `MockObserver` class is a mock of the `StreamObserver` class from the gRPC library, used for testing the process function of [SparkConnectPlanner](url).\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, the [[`MockObserver`]] class is located in the test folder, which is not shaded by sbt-assembly, unlike the main folder.\r\n\r\nThis results in a compilation error when open-source libraries call the `transform(spark: SparkSession, command: proto.Command)` function in `SparkConnectPlannerTestUtils`, which in turn calls `SparkConnectPlanner(executeHolder).process(command, new MockObserver())`.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the `MockObserver` class should be moved to the main folder to be shaded as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds several new tag-related APIs in Connect back to Spark Core. Following the isolation practice in the original Connect API, the newly introduced APIs also support isolation:\r\n\r\n- `interrupt{Tag,All,Operation}` can only cancel jobs created by this Spark session.\r\n-  `{add,remove}Tag` and `{get,clear}Tags` only apply to jobs created by this Spark session.\r\n\r\nInstead of returning query IDs like in Spark Connect, here in Spark SQL, these methods will return SQL execution root IDs - as \"query IDs\" are only for Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo close the API gap between Connect and Core.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, Core users can use some new APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-20T12:26:23Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T11:34:17Z","closed_at":"2024-09-18T03:06:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"717c91ab3c4c19232e656c0ca2ecf74d8c6c0b75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47815/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47815/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47815/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e66ba0aeca446a3b0ff903e8f05f2505e08eb44d","head":{"label":"xupefei:reverse-api-tag","ref":"reverse-api-tag","sha":"e66ba0aeca446a3b0ff903e8f05f2505e08eb44d","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR allows high-priority analysis errors to be thrown first when a low-priority error on LCA (lateral column alias) occurs in the same query. \r\nIt preempts and stores the LCA error during check analysis. If another error happens, it will be thrown first; If not, the LCA error will be thrown at the end of the analysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis helps improve the user experience on errors, to provide higher priority information and the root cause to users. \r\nThe test in the PR is one case that UNRESOLVED_COLUMN should be thrown, instead of the LCA internal error, which was thrown without the change because the segment sits in the CTE definition that is traversed first in CheckAnalysis.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, `interval second` values where the number of microseconds needed to be represented by 19 digits could not be cast to decimal. This PR removes this gap.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select 1000000000000.000000::interval second\").show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------+\r\n|CAST(1000000000000.000000 AS INTERVAL SECOND)|\r\n+---------------------------------------------+\r\n|INTERVAL '1000000000000' SECOND              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select 1000000000000.000000::interval second::decimal(38, 10)\").show(false)\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [NUMERIC_VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE.WITH_SUGGESTION]  0 cannot be represented as Decimal(18, 6). If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error, and return NULL instead. SQLSTATE: 22003\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change adds additional coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users couldn't cast large second intervals to decimals earlier. Now, they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test in `IntervalExpressionsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds Encoders.javaSerialization to connect.\r\n\r\nIt does this by creating an encoder that does not really encode data, but that transforms into something that can be encoded. This is also useful for situations in which we want to define custom serialization logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a stepping stone for adding Kryo based serialization.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change increases parity between the connect and classic scala interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests for both Arrow and Expression encoders.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add chunking logic to chunk arrow data into multiple batches if input rows are larger than `ARROW_EXECUTION_MAX_RECORDS_PER_BATCH` and pass to the Python worker to ensure scalability.\r\n- We added a new class `BaseStreamingArrowWriter` and let `ApplyInPandasWithStateWriter` reuse some of its methods.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf input rows have a giant size of records, our system should be able to handle it in a large scale. Without this change, we will try to send all the rows to the Python worker and may result with an OOM error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `xpath` expression incorrectly marks its return type as array of non-null strings. However, it can actually return an array containing nulls.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR logs the IOException details in FileHistoryProvider, used by SHS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this change, when an IOException is caught generic messages are logged without the exception details. This makes it hard to troubleshoot because the root cause is lost.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake the change such that `TaskSetExcludeList` and `HeathTracker` can be enabled independently.\r\n\r\nWhen application level `HealthTracker` is created, but taskset level exclusion is not enabled, `TaskSetExcludeList` would be created in dry run mode, where it still records and reports task failure data to `HealthTracker` but does not participate in scheduler decision making.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when `spark.excludeOnFailure.enabled` is set to true, both task set level exclusion (`TaskSetExcludeList`) and application level (`HealthTracker`) would both be enabled.\r\nIn some cases, we only want to enable exclusion on a single dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, introduced two new user facing configs `spark.excludeOnFailure.application.enabled` and `spark.excludeOnFailure.taskAndStage.enabled` that allows setting exclusion for taskset/application individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a continuation of a prior performance improvement: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47428 that eagerly evaluates memory-heavy `UnresolvedUnlineTables` parse tree nodes as soon as they are constructed in the AstBuilder. \r\n\r\nThis PR applies this optimization to any statement that might contain one or more `VALUES()` clauses (such as subqueries etc), instead of just applying that optimization to `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` statements, which is what the prior PR did.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith these changes we not only reduce the memory footprint of every statement that can contain the `VALUES()` clause, but we also improve upon the previous optimization as we avoid unnecessary traversals of the parse tree, which not only improves the runtime performance, but also minimizes the amount of time in which the `UnresolvedInlineTable` is kept in memory. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nProvided scala tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUsing `spark.read.option(\"Foo\", True)` resulted in an uppercase `'True'` string in Python Spark Connect client, while in all other cases (scala with both Spark Connect and no Spark Connect, pyspark with no Spark Connect) it would be normalized to `'true'`. This is because `to_str` helper should be used instead of `str`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is now inconsistent with other cases. Passing `\"True\"` as boolean options seems to be breaking Delta CDF reader (to be fixed separately, that it should be able to handle the literal case-insensitively)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis makes Column API implementation agnostic. We do this by:\r\n- Removing `Column.expr`. This has been replaced in the source by either the use of `Column` itself, the use of an Expression that wraps a ColumnNode, or by (implicit) conversions.\r\n- Removing `Column.apply(e: Expression)`. This has been replaced in the source by the `ExpressionUtils.column` (implicit) method, or by the use of `Column`.\r\n- Removing `TypedColumn.withTypedColumn(..)`. This has been replaced by direct calls to `TypedAggUtils.withInputType(...)`.\r\n- Removing `Column.named` and `Column.generateAlias`. This has been moved to `ExpressionUtils.`.\r\n- Making a bunch of pandas and arrow operators use a Column instead of an Expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is one of the last steps in our effort to unify the Scala Column API for Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-16T03:42:44Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T09:58:08Z","closed_at":"2024-08-20T02:19:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85df8574a4ce79bb64f325961608807d9d2a740e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCredit to @maheshk114 for the initial investigation and the fix.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix a bug where the shuffle service's ID is kept among the block location list at the removing of a RDD block from a node. Before this change `StorageLevel.NONE` is used to notify about the block remove which causes the block manager master ignoring the update of the locations for shuffle service's IDs (for details please see the method `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint#updateBlockInfo()` and keep in mind `StorageLevel.NONE.useDisk` is `false`). But after this change only the replication count is set to 0 to notify the block remove so `StorageLevel#isValid` is still false but `storageLevel.useDisk` is kept as `true` this way the the shuffle service's ID will be removed from the block location list.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf the block location is not updated properly, then tasks fails with fetch failed exception. The tasks will try to read the RDD blocks from a node using external shuffle service. The read will fail, if the node is already decommissioned.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARN BlockManager [Executor task launch worker for task 25.0 in stage 6.0 (TID 1567)]: Failed to fetch remote block rdd_5_25

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nV2 Catalog can also support built-in data sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nV2 catalog could still support spark built-in data sources if the V2 catalog returns v1 table and do not track partitions in catalog. This is because we do not need to require V2 catalog to implement every thing to support built-in data sources (as that is a big chunk of work).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUT\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to revive https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47192, which was [reverted](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47747) due to regression in `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark`.\r\n\r\n**Root cause**\r\nWe eventually decided to aggregate peak memory usage from all consumers on each `acquireExecutionMemory` invocation. (see [this discussion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47192#discussion_r1681934753)), which is O(n) complexity where `n` is the number of consumers.\r\n\r\n`ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark` is implemented in a way that all iterations are run in a single task context, therefore the number of consumers is exploding.\r\n\r\nNotice that `TaskMemoryManager.consumers` is never cleaned up the whole lifecycle, and `TaskMemoryManager.acquireExecutionMemory` is a very frequent operation, doing a linear complexity(in terms of number of consumers) operation here might not be a good choice. This benchmark might be a corner case, but it's still possible to have a large number of consumers in a large query plan.\r\n\r\nI fallback to the previous implementation: maintain current execution memory with an extra lock. cc @Ngone51 \r\n\r\n#### Benchmark result\r\n[ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark-results](https://github.com/liuzqt/spark/actions/runs/10415213026)\r\n[ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark-jdk21-results](https://github.com/liuzqt/spark/actions/runs/10414246805)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

`QueryCompilationErrors.windowSpecificationNotDefinedError`:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4718d59c6c4\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/0b48d3f61b7\r\n\r\nHowever, consider the following query:\r\n\r\n`SELECT (SUM(col1) OVER(unspecified_window) / 1) FROM VALUES (1)`\r\n\r\nHere `UnreolvedWindowExpression` is wrapped into the division expression. And `CheckAnalysis` throws a different unrelated `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Invalid call to dataType on unresolved object SQLSTATE: XX000` exception earlier from this [case](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0b48d3f61b726209e96b0b967530534b5ad9101d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/CheckAnalysis.scala#L308).\r\n\r\nThe solution to improve this would be to match `UnreolvedWindowExpression` early.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve error message for incorrect window usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the error message is better now\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor custom catalogs that have access control, read and write permissions can be different. However, currently Spark always call `TableCatalog#loadTable` to look up the table, no matter it's for read or write.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a variant of `loadTable` that indicates the required write privileges. All the write commands will call this new method to look up tables instead. This new method has a default implementation that just calls `loadTable`, so there is no breaking change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nallow more fine-grained access control for custom catalogs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

Words are separated only by ASCII space.\r\nSpecial care is taken when lowercasing Σ, to take into account if it is at the end of the word(with respect to case-ignorable characters) and should be lowercased into ς, or in other case into σ(this already works correctly with the current implementation because lowercasing a whole string handled this, but in this PR this was handled manually because lowercase function wasn't used).\r\n\r\nThe key difference between outputs that this PR introduces is:\r\n| input | current_initCap(input) | new_initCap(input) |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| İo   | İo (I\\u0307o)  | İo   |\r\n| ß ﬁ ﬃ ﬀ ﬆ    | ß ﬁ ﬃ ﬀ ﬆ   | Ss Fi Ffi Ff St   |\r\n\r\nThese are just some examples, much more mappings are actually affected.\r\nMore details about the key changes are in the next section.\r\nThis behaviour is put under the ICU_CASE_MAPPINGS_ENABLED flag in SQLConf, which is true by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe previous implementation first lowercases the complete string, and then titlecases the first character of every word[1].\r\nWhen titlecasing the first character of every word, it maps a single codepoint to a single codepoint[2].\r\n\r\nThis leads to the following behaviour with respect to [1]:\r\n| input | initCap(input) |\r\n|----------|----------|\r\n| İo    | İo (I\\u0307o)   |\r\n\r\nIn summary, when the lowercase of a first character(for example \"İ\") in a word maps onto more than 1 character(for example \"I\\u0307\"), we only consider the first character(\"I\" in \"I\\u0307\") of that lowercased letter(\"İ\") for titlecasing instead of that complete character because we titlecase only the first character in a word after we completely lowercase it.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour that [2] produces is:\r\n| input | initCap(input) |\r\n|----------|----------|\r\n| ß ﬁ ﬃ ﬀ ﬆ    | ß ﬁ ﬃ ﬀ ﬆ   |\r\n\r\nWhile the expected output would probably be:\r\n| input | initCap(input) |\r\n|----------|----------|\r\n| ß ﬁ ﬃ ﬀ ﬆ    | Ss Fi Ffi Ff St   |\r\n\r\nwhich clearly maps titlecase of each of those characters into more than one character, which is not handled because of [2].\r\n\r\nAgain, these are just examples and not an exhaustive list of all the mappings that have been changed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, InitCap expression will now return different results for:\r\n\r\n- One-to-many case mapping (e.g. Turkish dotted I, ß, ﬁ)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTests in CollationSupportSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR only changes the `test:runMain` description related to run command in the code comments to `Test/runMain`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we use the execution command in the code comments, we will see the following compilation warning:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test:runMain org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TopKBenchmark\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[warn] sbt 0.13 shell syntax is deprecated; use slash syntax instead: sql / Test / runMain\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe relevant comments should be updated to eliminate the compilation warnings when run the command.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually run the test using the updated command and check that the corresponding compilation warning is no longer present.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `scalastyle` and `checkstyle` rules to avoid `URL` constructors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe java.net.URL class does not itself encode or decode any URL components according to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. \r\n\r\nSo, from Java 20, all `URL` constructors are deprecated. We had better use better `URI` class.\r\n- https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8295949\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added rules.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, there is only two exceptional instances in `JettyUtils.scala` and `UISuite.scala`.\r\n- `JettyUtils` is tricky instance\r\n- UISuite test case is supposed to add bad URL which URI prevents with `java.net.URISyntaxException`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactoring `EvalInlineTables` in a way so we can use its body to resolve inline tables using `ResolveInlineTables` rule without traversing the whole tree. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the description of `EvalInlineTables` you can see that it is an optimizer rule which should run at the very end of the analysis phase. Nevertheless it is invoked while resolving inline tables in the analysis phase. We discovered that it can be done without traversing the whole tree so we refactored `EvalInlineTables` in a way that we can use it's body in `ResolveInlineTables`  which improves readability of the code and its performance a bit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove unnecessary checks in the code to make it cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are sure that `condition` is `SingleStatementExec` and if `assert(curr.get.isInstanceOf[SingleStatementExec])` passes we are still not sure if everything is working correctly. If it fails, we are sure something is wrong, but then it represents the bug in our `iterator` code and should be caught by different unit tests .  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, support for REPEAT statement in SQL scripting is introduced.\r\n\r\nChanges summary:\r\n\r\nGrammar/parser changes\r\n- `repeatStatement` grammar rule\r\n- `visitRepeatStatement` rule visitor\r\n- `RepeatStatement` logical operetor\r\n\r\n`RepeatStatementExec` execution node\r\nInternal sates - `Condition` and `Body`\r\nIterator implementation - switch between body and condition until condition evaluates to true\r\nSqlScriptingInterpreter - added logic to transform RepeatStatement logical operator to RepeatStatementExec execution node\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a part of SQL Scripting introduced to Spark, REPEAT statement is a basic control flow construct in the SQL language.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests are introduced to all of the three scripting test suites: `SqlScriptingParserSuite`, `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite` and `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-14T11:17:29Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T08:48:34Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T07:50:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"077427cc40940a3e6b73f602f739b686080674fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27ee35622356c37389a4babccfa785dfb7b8bf4b","head":{"label":"dusantism-db:sql-scripting-repeat-statement","ref":"sql-scripting-repeat-statement","sha":"27ee35622356c37389a4babccfa785dfb7b8bf4b","user":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":834060712,"node_id":"R_kgDOMbbBqA","name":"spark","full_name":"dusantism-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db/spark","description":"Apache
