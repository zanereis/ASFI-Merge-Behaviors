The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for \"simple\" scalar Scala UDFs for the Spark Connect Scala/JVM Client. “Simple” here refers to UDFs that utilize no client-specific class files (e.g REPL-generated) and JARs. Essentially, a “simple” UDF may only reference in-built libraries and classes defined within the scope of the UDF.\r\n\r\nA user would then be able to do the following (example):\r\n```\r\ndef myFunc(x: Int): Int = x + 5\r\n\r\nval myUdf = udf(myFunc _)\r\ndf = df.select(myUdf(Column(\"id\")))\r\n```\r\n#### Implementation Details:\r\n\r\nA shared JVM object `UdfPacket` is introduced in the common package to encapsulate the Scala UDF and its encoders (via Agnostic Encoders) such that it could be serialized/deserialized on the client and server respectively. \r\n\r\nFurther, a new protobuf message `ScalarScalaUDF` is introduced to transmit Scala/JVM specific information to the server (such as the above serialized JVM object).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUDFs are crucial for the completeness of the Spark Connect Scala/JVM client. We introduce this component incrementally.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users are now able to run \"simple\" scalar Scala UDFs through the Scala/JVM client.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test + Integration test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims add `ServicesResourceTransformer` rule to connect server module shade configuration to make sure `grpc.ManagedChannelProvider` and `grpc.ServerProvider` can be used in server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKeep `grpc.ManagedChannelProvider` and `grpc.ServerProvider` and other spi  usable after grpc being shaded, sbt doesn't need to be fixed because `sbt-assembly` does this by default.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, DS V2 pushdown framework compiles the `SortOrder` with fixed code. These fixed code outputs the fixed syntax format, such as `ORDER BY col ASC NULLS FIRST`.\r\nThis is not flexible and friendly for some databases that do not support this syntax.\r\nFor example, `ORDER BY col ASC NULLS FIRST` is not supported by MS SQL Server who not recognize the syntax `NULLS FIRST`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR want compile the `SortOrder` with `V2ExpressionSQLBuilder`'s `visitSortOrder`, so that JDBC dialects could compile `SortOrder` by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-01T09:00:05Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T12:30:13Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T12:18:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51a06f25881919756d5ccdb6da9566eda2358498","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39846/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39846/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39846/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd0774bd91caf73ffec95b14ebca02f89482896d","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-42278","ref":"SPARK-42278","sha":"bd0774bd91caf73ffec95b14ebca02f89482896d","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `RocksDB` for `spark.history.store.hybridStore.diskBackend` by default instead of `LevelDB`.\r\n\r\nThe last update of `LevelDB` is about over 10 years.\r\n- `all except aarch64`: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.fusesource.leveldbjni/leveldbjni-all/1.8 (Oct 17, 2013)\r\n- `aarch64-only`: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openlabtesting.leveldbjni/leveldbjni-all/1.8 (Aug 28, 2019)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRocksDB is maintained well and works on all environments where Apache Spark supports while LevelDB is not maintained at all in these days and doesn't work in some environment like the following.\r\n```\r\n$

`spark.history.store.hybridStore.enabled` is `false` by default. There is no behavior change.\r\nIn case of `spark.history.store.hybridStore.enabled=true`, History Server will rebuild the new hybrid store simply.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI tried to understand what was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36737 and made the code more readable and added some test. Many thanks to @nyingping!\r\n\r\nThe change in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35362 brought a bug when the `timestamp` is less than 0, i.e. before `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`. Then for some windows, spark returns a wrong `windowStart` time. The root cause of this bug is how the module operator(%) works with negative number. \r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> 1 % 3\r\nres0: Int = 1\r\n\r\nscala> -1 % 3\r\nres1: Int = -1 // Mathematically it should be 2 here\r\n```\r\nThis lead to a wrong calculation result of `windowStart`. For a concrete example: \r\n\r\n```\r\n* Example calculation:\r\n   * For simplicity assume windowDuration = slideDuration.\r\n   * | x x x x x x x x x x x x | x x x x x x x x x x x x | x x x x x x x x x x x x |\r\n   * |                         |----l1 ----|---- l2 -----|\r\n   *                        lastStart   timestamp   lastStartWrong\r\n   * Normally when timestamp > startTime (or equally remainder > 0), we get\r\n   * l1 = remainder = (timestamp - startTime) % slideDuration, lastStart = timeStamp - remainder\r\n   * However, when timestamp < startTime (or equally remainder < 0), the value of remainder is\r\n   * -l2 (note the negative sign), and lastStart is then at the position of lastStartWrong.\r\n   * So we need to subtract a slideDuration.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug fix.\r\n\r\nExample from the original PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36737: \r\n\r\nHere df3 and df4 has time before 1970, so timestamp < 0.\r\n```\r\nval df3 = Seq(\r\n      (\"1969-12-31 00:00:02\", 1),\r\n      (\"1969-12-31 00:00:12\", 2)).toDF(\"time\", \"value\")\r\nval df4 = Seq(\r\n      (LocalDateTime.parse(\"1969-12-31T00:00:02\"), 1),\r\n      (LocalDateTime.parse(\"1969-12-31T00:00:12\"), 2)).toDF(\"time\", \"value\")    Seq(df3, df4).foreach { df =>\r\n      checkAnswer(\r\n        df.select(window($\"time\", \"10 seconds\", \"10 seconds\", \"5 seconds\"), $\"value\")\r\n          .orderBy($\"window.start\".asc)\r\n          .select($\"window.start\".cast(StringType), $\"window.end\".cast(StringType), $\"value\"),\r\n        Seq(\r\n          Row(\"1969-12-30 23:59:55\", \"1969-12-31 00:00:05\", 1),\r\n          Row(\"1969-12-31 00:00:05\", \"1969-12-31 00:00:15\", 2))\r\n      )\r\n} \r\n```\r\nWithout the change this would error with:\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 2 ==                      == Spark Answer - 2 ==\r\n!struct<>                                      struct<CAST(window.start AS STRING):string,CAST(window.end AS STRING):string,value:int>\r\n![1969-12-30 23:59:55,1969-12-31 00:00:05,1]   [1969-12-31 00:00:05,1969-12-31 00:00:15,1]\r\n![1969-12-31 00:00:05,1969-12-31 00:00:15,2]   [1969-12-31 00:00:15,1969-12-31 00:00:25,2] \r\n```\r\nNotice how this is shifted with one `slideDuration`.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds cases in LimitPushDown to push limits through Python UDFs. In order to allow for this, we need to call LimitPushDown in SparkOptimizer after the \"Extract Python UDFs\" batch. We also add PushProjectionThroughLimit afterwards in order to plan CollectLimit. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now, LimitPushdown does not push limits through Python UDFs, which means that expensive Python UDFs can be run on potentially large amounts of input. This PR adds this capability, while ensuring that a GlobalLimit - LocalLimit pattern stays at the top in order to trigger the CollectLimit code path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip doctests if the dependencies for Spark Connect are not installed.\r\nThe skipping logic has to be added before the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use an available ephemeral port for Spark Connect server in testing by using `0` to server, and the actual local port in client side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo allow parallel testing that we have in `./python/run-tests`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./python/run-tests --module

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the case of `V2SessionCatalog.alterTable`, `SessionCatalog.alterTable` is called for any type of modification. In case `HiveExternalCatalog` is configured, the `alterTable` method does not support schema modification. For schema modifications it is necessary to use `alterTableDataSchema`. For this particular case, operations like adding columns or changing columns are not working.\r\n\r\nIf we analyze the commands that perform column modifications in `SessionCatalog` (`AlterTableChangeColumnCommand`, `AlterTableAddColumnsCommand`) they use the `alterTableDataSchema` method for schema modification and not `alterTable`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR it is proposed that the modifications of the schema in `V2sessionCatalog` are done through the `alterTableDataSchema` method of the `SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix this bug\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA `HiveExternalV2SessionCatalogSuite` is introduced to launch the same tests as `V2SessionCatalogTableSuite` but with the hive catalog configured. Despite the improvements introduced not everything is supported for `HiveExternalCatalog` so some tests are excluded.","created_at":"2023-01-31T20:15:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T00:19:56Z","closed_at":"2023-05-14T00:19:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a07f2f0b8a30566f0be35939e4265a5fe3c8e95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7288eceeaf100e6640172a5318e4f8806c5f5853","head":{"label":"planga82:bugfix/V2sessioncatlogAlterTable","ref":"bugfix/V2sessioncatlogAlterTable","sha":"7288eceeaf100e6640172a5318e4f8806c5f5853","user":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182507758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1MDc3NTg=","name":"sparkFork","full_name":"planga82/sparkFork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/planga82/sparkFork","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLog Allocation Stalls when we are unable to allocate any pods (but wish to) during a K8s snapshot event.\r\nTrigger Allocation event without blocking on snapshot provided that there is enough room in maxPendingPods.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark on K8s dynamic allocation can be difficult to debug, prone to stalling in heavily loaded clusters, and waiting for snapshot events has an unnecessary delay for pod allocation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNew log messages, faster pod scale up.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified existing test to verify that we are both triggering allocation with pending pods and tracking when we are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add test for detecting duplicated name of error classes to keep the error class unique.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe name of error class should be unique, so we should check if it's duplicated or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually test in case `COLUMN_IN_LIST` is duplicated as below:\r\n```shell\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL [0.006s]: test_error_classes_duplicated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refine html link for documentation in error messages by introducing `SPARK_DOC_ROOT` into `core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/package.scala` that contains global directory for documentation root link: `https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve error class readability and make sure using right root document directory across all source codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated the whole existing tests related to this changes.\r\n\r\nBasically, run `./build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37734 which handles the case when the batch is single scalar value.\r\n\r\nEssentially it proposes to work around the pandas behaviour by explicitly casting back to the original data type of NumPy Arrow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> np.squeeze(np.array([1.])).dtype\r\ndtype('float64')\r\n>>> pd.Series(np.squeeze(np.array([1.]))).dtype\r\ndtype('O')\r\n>>> pd.Series(np.squeeze(np.array([1., 1.]))).dtype\r\ndtype('float64')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsing `predict_batch_udf` fails when the size of batch happen to have single value. For example, even when the batch size is set to 10, if the size of data is 21, it fails because the last batch consists of the single value.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refine error classes and messages by using the Python type object name for error class name and its messages.\r\n\r\nnit - Also add missing dots at the end of error messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe type name was inconsistent in the previous error messages, e.g. string and str, int and integer, and the sometimes the error class name is too long to read.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR reverts the `SparkPath`changes to `FileIndex` and `FileRelation` because they provided little benefit to Open Source Spark, but are widely used extension points for other open source projects. For the 3.4.0 release we want to preserve this type of binary compatibility.\r\n\r\nThat said, we reserve the right to make this change for Spark 4.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRevert `inputFiles: Array[SparkPath]` back to `inputFiles: Array[String]`, with an explicit comment that the strings are expected to be url-encoded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis is to revert an internal interface change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2023-01-30T16:06:00Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T02:10:19Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T00:10:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19731262ebeb5af4053b22a0ceaf4d556c9a43cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1102f05f40b63ff1d84a41fd4aca9582a78c2f40","head":{"label":"databricks-david-lewis:SPARK_PATH_FOLLOWUP","ref":"SPARK_PATH_FOLLOWUP","sha":"1102f05f40b63ff1d84a41fd4aca9582a78c2f40","user":{"login":"databricks-david-lewis","id":39497924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis","html_url":"https://github.com/databricks-david-lewis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137137466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcxMzc0NjY=","name":"spark-opensource","full_name":"databricks-david-lewis/spark-opensource","private":false,"owner":{"login":"databricks-david-lewis","id":39497924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDk3OTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39497924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis","html_url":"https://github.com/databricks-david-lewis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/databricks-david-lewis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/databricks-david-lewis/spark-opensource","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr as follows:\r\n- Move `ClientE2ETestSuite` into a new separate module, the new module named `connect-jvm-e2e-tests`, and add a new profile named `connect-client-tests` to activate this module. The new profile is added because the current test way of this module is cumbersome and it is not easy to build and test by default. \r\n\r\nwe need the follow steps for the new module test with maven\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests install -pl repl -am -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests install -pl connector/connect/common -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests install -pl connector/connect/server -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests install -pl connector/connect/client/jvm -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn clean test -pl connector/connect/client/jvm-e2e-tests -Pscala-2.12 -Pconnect-client-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests clean install -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/mvn clean test -pl connector/connect/client/jvm-e2e-tests -Pscala-2.12 -Pconnect-client-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems simpler to use sbt for test, but in the current dependency management way, using sbt to fetch the no-shaded connect-client jar cannot achieve the purpose of testing both the shaded client jar and the shaded server jar in the E2E tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean package -Pscala-2.12\r\nbuild/sbt \"connect-client-jvm-e2e-tests/test\" -Pscala-2.12 -Pconnect-client-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Add a new GA task named `connect-jvm-e2e-tests`, this task use maven to test shaded `connect-client-jvm`. Under the current dependency management way, if we can find out how to fetch the assembly jar by sbt, we should change it to a more efficient sbt test mode.\r\n\r\n- Remove `repl` test dependency from `connector/connect/client/jvm/pom.xml` due to `ClientE2ETestSuite` move into separate module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe should do E2E test with shaded client jar and shaded server jar. Before this pr, `ClientE2ETestSuite` is in `connect-client-jvm` module and the test will using shaded server jar and no-shaded client jar. After this pr, the test purpose can be achieved by using maven, but the test way using sbt needs to be further explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- New GA Task passed\r\n- Manual check:\r\n\r\nScala 2.13 using maven \r\n\r\n```\r\ngh pr checkout

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is raised from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39543/files#r1082159637, to integrate the `MUST_AGGREGATE_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY` and `MUST_AGGREGATE_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY_OUTPUT`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLogically, `MUST_AGGREGATE_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY` and `MUST_AGGREGATE_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY_OUTPUT` are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nWe should deduplicate the error classes when possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe change binary to unsupported dataType in csv format, both for v1 and v2 dataSource.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore reasonable and make the performance the same in both writing and reading csv files or tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, few people use binary type in csv format and we add a tip in sql-migration-guide from 3.3 to 3.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new test case in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.REPEATED_PIVOT` to `REPEATED_CLAUSE`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`REPEATED_PIVOT` is actually not an `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`, and there must be other cases we should cover in more generic way\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nN/A","created_at":"2023-01-30T03:56:28Z","updated_at":"2024-06-11T05:51:10Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T08:01:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0c9460e150bb7c0bdb147a06c01dafa2bfe2ab9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0dce02272bb8504061fe9ea93a3a898e15cbfffc","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-41735","ref":"SPARK-41735","sha":"0dce02272bb8504061fe9ea93a3a898e15cbfffc","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-30T03:25:31Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:48:03Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T13:50:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd3ccfcc53ae029cc805215130cc6e3474e8c399","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d65798275f06b68b4b28c64a4c6bcd6a6a620142","head":{"label":"itholic:PIVOT_AFTER_GROUP_BY","ref":"PIVOT_AFTER_GROUP_BY","sha":"d65798275f06b68b4b28c64a4c6bcd6a6a620142","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `GitHub Action lint` job by skipping `PySpark` and `SparkR` documentation generations if PySpark and R module is unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`Documentation Generation` took over 53 minutes because it generates all Java/Scala/SQL/PySpark/R documentation always. However, `R` module is not changed frequently so that the documentation is always identical. `PySpark` module is more frequently changed, but still we can skip in many cases. This PR shows the reduction from `53` minutes to `18` minutes.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 4 36 07

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support `fill_value` for `ps.Series.(add|radd)`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Currently I made `fill_value` to only support when `other` is scalar value (int, str, float), because when `other` is container type it requires combine `self` and `other` to compare the value for each position to check If data in both corresponding Series (or list, tuple) locations is missing, which is potentially very expensive in pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo basic support for `fill_value` for `ps.Series.(add|radd)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> psser  # pandas-on-Spark Series\r\n0    1.0\r\n1    2.0\r\n2

io.grpc.protobuf.ProtoUtils.marshaller(Lorg/sparkproject/connect/protobuf/Message;)Lio/grpc/MethodDescriptor$Marshaller;`\r\n\r\nThe reason for the failure is that when we package `connect-client-jvm` module, we relocation the code path related to protobuf, but the relevant api in grpc has not been changed, so when we test  `connect-client-jvm` shaded jar, will throw the above NoSuchMethodError exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this pr add the shade and relocation rule of grpc to `connect-client-jvm` module, both maven and sbt. After this change, the above test can run successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `connect-client-jvm` shaded jar usable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to allow `columns` parameter when creating `ps.DataFrame` with `ps.Series` with limited condition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn pandas, they attach the new column consists with missing values when `columns` contains more than 2 columns including valid column:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pser  # pandas Series\r\n0.427027    1\r\n0.904592    2\r\n0.599768    3\r\nName: x, dtype: int64\r\n\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame(pser, columns=[\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"])\r\n          x    y    z\r\n0.427027  1  NaN  NaN\r\n0.904592  2  NaN  NaN\r\n0.599768  3  NaN  NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this method is potentially pretty expensive in pandas API on Spark, so I guess that's why we currently don't support it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've seen examples of using the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.DataFrame(pser, columns=[\"x\"])\r\n          x\r\n0.427027  1\r\n0.904592  2\r\n0.599768  3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown in the example above, this just works the same as `pd.DataFrame(pser)` (without `columns`).\r\n\r\nBut it fails with `ps.Series` as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.DataFrame(psser, columns=[\"x\"])  # `psser` is pandas-on-Spark Series\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/pandas/frame.py\", line 539, in __init__\r\n    assert columns is None\r\nAssertionError \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, user might just want to clearly state column names in their code, so I believe we can allow this rather than raising an `AssertionError`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.DataFrame(psser, columns=[\"x\"])  # `psser` is pandas-on-Spark Series\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/pandas/frame.py\", line 539, in __init__\r\n    assert columns is None\r\nAssertionError \r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.DataFrame(psser, columns=[\"x\"])  # `psser` is pandas-on-Spark Series\r\n          x\r\n0.427027  1\r\n0.904592  2\r\n0.599768  3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

COALESCE function:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  CASE WHEN id = 200 THEN 1\r\n       WHEN id = 200 THEN 2 -- same condition, can remove\r\n       WHEN id = 200 THEN 3 -- same condition, can remove\r\n       ELSE 0 END as c1,\r\n  coalesce(\r\n    id + 1,\r\n    id + 1, -- same expression, can remove\r\n    id) as c2\r\nFROM t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOptimize CASE_WHEN

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe TimestampNTZ schema inference over data sources is not consistent in the current code (most of them are for the purpose of backward compatibility to infer as Timestamp LTZ by default):\r\n* CSV & JSON: depends on `spark.sql.timestampType` to determine the result\r\n* ORC: depends on whether there is metadata written. If not, inferred as Timestamp LTZ\r\n* Parquet: infer timestamp column with annotation isAdjustedToUTC = false as Timestamp NTZ. There is a configuration `spark.sql.parquet.timestampNTZ.enabled` to determine whether to support NTZ. When `spark.sql.parquet.timestampNTZ.enabled` is false, users can't write Timestamp NTZ columns to parquet files.\r\n* Avro: [Local timestamp](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/spec.html#Local+timestamp+%28microsecond+precision%29) type is a new logical type so there is no backward compatibility issue and there is no configuration to control the inference.\r\n\r\nSince we are going to release Timestamp NTZ in Spark 3.4.0, I propose using a new configuration `spark.sql.inferTimestampNTZInDataSources.enabled` for TimestampNTZ schema inference. The flag is false by default for backward compatibility. When true, if a column can be either TimestampNTZ or TimestampLTZ, the infer result will be TimestampNTZ. This PR converts JSON/CSV data sources. If the proposal is fine to others, I will continue on the other data sources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* The TimestampNTZ schema inference over data sources is not consistent in the current code\r\n* The configuration `spark.sql.timestampType` is heavy. It changes the DDL/SQL functions's default timestamp type. If a user only wants to read back the newly written TimestampNTZ data without breaking the existing workloads, having a lightweight flag is a good idea.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, TimestampNTZ is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

Currently these queries fail with `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS_IN_WINDOW`.\r\n\r\nThe following case is not supported:\r\n* LCA in Aggregate queries with Window, with Having clause.\r\n  It throws an `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS_IN_AGGREGATE_WITH_WINDOW_AND_HAVING` exception.\r\n  For example,\r\n  ```sql\r\n  > select dept as d, rank() over (partition by d order by avg(salary)) as rank\r\n    from employee \r\n    group by dept\r\n    having sum(bonus) < 3000\r\n\r\n  org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS_IN_AGGREGATE_WITH_WINDOW_AND_HAVING]\r\n  The feature is not supported: Referencing lateral column alias `d` in the aggregate query both with window\r\n  expressions and with having clause. Please rewrite the aggregate query by removing the having clause or\r\n  removing lateral alias reference in the SELECT list.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nNote that Spark initially don't have full support for Aggregate queries with Window, with Order by clause (sort). For example, the following query **without LCA**:\r\n```sql\r\nselect dept, sum(sum(salary)) over (partition by dept order by sum(salary)) as sum_sum\r\nfrom employee\r\ngroup by dept\r\norder by sum(bonus)\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter with name `bonus` cannot be resolved.\r\n```\r\nTherefore LCA doesn't have the support for the above query type as well.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Details\r\nThe implementation doesn't really change a lot in the rules itself, but to change the rule application order. This PR changes to apply the rule `ResolveLateralColumnAliasReference` before `ExtractWindowExpressions`.\r\nThat is, it guarantees when it starts to add Window (`ExtractWindowExpressions`), there is no `LateralColumnAliasReference` left in the Project and Aggregate. They are already handled and removed by `ResolveLateralColumnAliasReference`.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a query plan:\r\n```\r\n!'Project [name#6 AS n#52, dept#5 AS d#53, rank() windowspecdefinition(lateralAliasReference(d#53, d, d#53), salary#7 ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(..) AS rank#54]\r\n!+- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.employee  \r\n!   +- Relation spark_catalog.default.employee[dept#5,name#6,salary#7,bonus#8,properties#9]                                                                                             \r\n\r\n1. First apply rule ResolveLateralColumnAliasReference, adding a Project below:\r\n!'Project [name#6 AS n#52, d#53, rank() windowspecdefinition(d#53, salary#7 ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(..) AS rank#54]\r\n +- Project [dept#5, name#6, salary#7, bonus#8, properties#9, dept#5 AS d#53]    \r\n    +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.employee  \r\n       +- Relation spark_catalog.default.employee[dept#5,name#6,salary#7,bonus#8,properties#9] \r\n\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change updates `JsonProtocol` to add logic to exclude the \"Task Executor Metrics\" field from SparkListenerTaskEnd events in cases where all metric values are zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is done to save space from event logs when Spark runs under its default out-of-the-box configuration and tasks are shorter than the executor hearbeat interval.\r\n\r\n[SPARK-26329](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26329) added \"Task Executor Metrics\" to JsonProtocol SparkListenerTaskEnd JSON. With the default `spark.executor.metrics.pollingInterval = 0` configuration these metric values are only updated when heartbeats occur. If a task launches and finishes between executor heartbeats then all of the \"Task Executor Metrics\" values will be zero. For jobs with large numbers of short tasks, this contributes to significant event log bloat.\r\n\r\nJsonProtocol already knows how to handle the absence of the \"Task Executor Metrics\" field, so I think it's safe for us to omit this field when all values are zero.\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility that third-party code which directly consumes Spark event logs might be relying on the presence of this field. As an \"escape-hatch\" to avoid breaking such workloads, I have introduced a `spark.eventLog.includeAllZeroTaskExecutorMetrics` (default `false`) which can be set to `true` to restore the old behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo user-facing changes in history server.\r\n\r\nThis could be considered a user-facing change from the perspective of third-party code which does its own processing of Spark logs, hence the config. I think it's reasonable to set a sensible default which shrinks event logs for most users instead of keeping a conservative default to support a hypothetical third-party use case of our event logs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test cases in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to add `ExtendedConnectTest` to disable tests related to `RemoteSparkSession` selectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`RemoteSparkSession` related tests need to be prepared shaded `connect-server.jar`, so this causes developers must to run `sbt package` or `maven clean install -DskipTests` to prepare shaded `connect-server.jar` before testing `connect-client-jvm`, it seems a little cumbersome, so this pr add a new test tag `ExtendedConnectTest` to make developers have the ability to disable relevant test cases through `-Dtest.exclude.tags=org.apache.spark.tags.ExtendedConnectTest`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies JsonProtocol in order to skip logging of accumulator values in the logs for SparkListenerTaskStart, SparkListenerStageSubmitted, and SparkListenerTaskGettingResult events.\r\n\r\nThese events contain mutable TaskInfo and StageInfo objects, which in turn contain Accumulables fields. When a task or stage is submitted, Accumulables is initially empty. When the task or stage finishes, this field is updated with values from the task.\r\n\r\nIf a task or stage finishes _before_ the start event has been logged by the event logging listener then the start event will contain the Accumulable values from the task or stage end event.  \r\n\r\nThis PR updates JsonProtocol to log an empty Accumulables value for stage and task start events.\r\n\r\nI considered and rejected an alternative approach where the listener event itself would contain an immutable snapshot of the TaskInfo or StageInfo, as this will increase memory pressure on the driver during periods of heavy event logging.\r\n\r\nThose accumulables values in the start events are not used: I confirmed this by checking AppStatusListener and SQLAppStatusListener code.\r\n\r\nI have deliberately chosen to **not** drop the field for _job_ start events because it is technically possible (but rare) for a job to reference stages that are completed at the time that the job is submitted (a state can technically belong to multiple jobs) and in that case it seems consistent to have the StageInfo accurately reflect all of the information about the already-completed stage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis information isn't used by the History Server and contributes to wasteful bloat in event log sizes. In one real-world log, I found that ~10% of the uncompressed log size was due to these redundant Accumulable fields in stage and task start events.\r\n\r\nI don't think that we need to worry about backwards-compatibility here because the old behavior was non-deterministic: whether or not a start event log contained accumulator updates was a function of the relative speed of task completion and the processing rate of the event logging listener; it seems unlikely that any third-party event log consumers would be relying on such an inconsistently present value when they could instead rely on the values in the corresponding end events.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and updated tests in JsonProtocolSuite.","created_at":"2023-01-27T07:51:03Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T18:59:32Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T18:28:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ea3bdc6f2515ada3802c7646a0f8bb815049f8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc8520aabc593ba49054e970e49f561b106a33c5","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-42205-dont-log-accumulables-in-jsonprotocol-start-events","ref":"SPARK-42205-dont-log-accumulables-in-jsonprotocol-start-events","sha":"fc8520aabc593ba49054e970e49f561b106a33c5","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an off-by-default option to JsonProtocol to have it exclude certain redundant accumulator information from Spark event logs in order to save space and processing time.\r\n\r\nSeveral event logs types contain both TaskMetrics and Accumulables, but there is redundancy in how the TaskMetrics data is stored:\r\n\r\n- TaskMetrics are stored in a map called \"Task Metrics\" which maps from metric names to metric values.\r\n- An \"Accumulables\" field contains information on accumulator updates from the task, but this field includes updates from the TaskMetrics internal accumulators (both the value from the task, plus a running \"sum-so-far\" from all of the tasks completed up to that point).\r\n\r\nThe redundant task metrics accumulables are not actually used by the Spark History Server: I verified this by reading AppStatusListener and SQLAppStatusListener.\r\n\r\nI believe that this redundancy was introduced back in [SPARK-10620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10620) when Spark 1.x's separate TaskMetrics implementation was replaced by the current accumulator-based version.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add logic to exclude TaskMetrics internal accumulators when writing this field (if a new flag is enabled).\r\n\r\nThe new `spark.eventLog.includeTaskMetricsAccumulators` configuration (default `false`, meaning \"keep the redundant information\") can be set to `true` to exclude these redundant internal accumulator updates. \r\n\r\nFor now, I am merging this off-by-default, but in a followup PR for Spark 4.0.0 we might consider a change-of-default to `true` (in which case the flag would serve as an \"escape-hatch\" for users who want to restore the old behavior. Although I think it's somewhat unlikely that third-party non-Spark consumers of the event logs would be relying on this redundant information, this is changing a longstanding user-facing data format and thus needs a flag. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change reduces the size of Spark event logs, especially for logs from applications that run many tasks. It should also have slight benefits on event log read and write speed (although I haven't tried to quantify this).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo user-facing changes in Spark History Server.\r\n\r\nThis flag's effects could be considered a user-facing change from the perspective of third-party code which does its own direct processing of Spark event logs, hence the config. However, in this PR (by itself) the flag is off-by-default. Out-of-the-box user-facing changes will be discussed / proposed in a separate flag-flip PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests in `JsonProtocolSuite`.\r\n\r\nManual tests of event log size in `spark-shell` with a job that runs `spark.parallelize(1 to 1000, 1000).count()`. For this toy query, this PR's change shrunk the uncompressed event log size by ~15%. The relative size reduction will be even greater once other issues like https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42206 or https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42203 are fixed. The relative reduction will be smaller for tasks with many SQL metrics because those accumulables cannot be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for subquery decorrelation with INTERSECT and EXCEPT operators on the correlation paths. For example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT t1a, (\r\n  SELECT avg(b) FROM (\r\n    SELECT t2b as b FROM t2 WHERE t2a = t1a\r\n    INTERSECT\r\n    SELECT t3b as b FROM t3 WHERE t3a = t1a\r\n))\r\nFROM t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses the same logic as for UNION decorrelation added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39375. The only real change is logic added to handle INTERSECT/EXCEPT DISTINCT, which are rewritten to semi/anti join and require extra logic in rewriteDomainJoins.\r\n\r\n[This doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11b9ClCF2jYGU7vU2suOT7LRswYkg6tZ8_6xJbvxfh2I/edit#) describes how the decorrelation rewrite works for set operations and the code changes for it - see the INTERSECT/EXCEPT section in particular.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we always add DomainJoins for correlation through INTERSECT/EXCEPT, and never do direct substitution of the outer refs. That can also be added as an optimization in a follow-up - it only affects performance, not surface area coverage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve subquery support in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nBefore this change, queries like this would return an error like: `Decorrelate inner query through Intersect is not supported.`\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, this query can run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests and SQL query tests.\r\n\r\nMoved the UNION decorrelation SQL tests to file scalar-subquery-set-op.sql and duplicated them to test each of [UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT] [ALL/DISTINCT]\r\n\r\nFactors tested included:\r\n- Subquery type:\r\n  - Eligible for DecorrelateInnerQuery: Scalar, lateral join\r\n  - Not supported: IN, EXISTS\r\n- UNION inside and outside subquery\r\n- Correlation in where, project, group by, aggregates, or no correlation\r\n- Project, Aggregate, Window under the Union\r\n- COUNT bug\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-26T20:55:12Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T05:23:42Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T05:23:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"915db9309050852b96cbffbd870e05019bcadbd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39759/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39759/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39759/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed71664cf06703223f7918d0da9dfb79473ed9b9","head":{"label":"jchen5:subq-intersect","ref":"subq-intersect","sha":"ed71664cf06703223f7918d0da9dfb79473ed9b9","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is an improvement to the documentation of the excludeNodes configuration for Spark on YARN by clarifying the dependency with dynamic allocation.\r\nThe Spark exclude node functionality for Spark on YARN, introduced in [SPARK-26688], allows users to specify a list of node names that are excluded from resource allocation. This is done using the configuration parameter: `spark.yarn.exclude.nodes`  \r\nThe feature currently works only for executors allocated via dynamic allocation. To use the feature on Spark 3.3.1, for example, one may set the configurations `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true`, `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors=0` and `spark.executor.instances=0`, thus making Spark spawning executors only via dynamic allocation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent documentation does not address the dependency of excludeNodes with dynamic allocation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNA","created_at":"2023-01-26T18:59:13Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T13:55:26Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T13:55:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"355793a8d60625096ed77aeee41b88056ad8bca3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60e54ca1e98da81d7ed80487702f3afd654b6b71","head":{"label":"LucaCanali:updateDocExcludeNode","ref":"updateDocExcludeNode","sha":"60e54ca1e98da81d7ed80487702f3afd654b6b71","user":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145986175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDU5ODYxNzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"LucaCanali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267, #35357, #36889 and #38209.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduces `ScopedExpression`, which allows to resolve an expression against a set of attributes. This is used by `Dataset.groupByKey.agg`, `Dataset.groupByKey.flatMapSortedGroups`, and `Dataset.groupByKey.cogroupSorted` to fix surprising error messages and to make `Dataset.groupByKey.mapValues.agg` work at all.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCalling `ds.groupByKey(func: V => K)` creates columns to store the key value. These columns may conflict with columns that already exist in `ds`. Function `Dataset.groupByKey.agg` accounts for this with a very specific rule, which has some surprising weaknesses:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.range(1)\r\n  // groupByKey adds column 'value'\r\n  .groupByKey(id => id)\r\n  // which cannot be referenced, though it is suggested\r\n  .agg(count(\"value\"))\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Column 'value' does not exist.\r\nDid you mean one of the following? [value, id];\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn existing 'value' column can be referenced:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n// dataset with column 'value'\r\nspark.range(1).select($\"id\".as(\"value\")).as[Long]\r\n  // groupByKey adds another column 'value'\r\n  .groupByKey(id => id)\r\n  // agg accounts for the extra column and excludes it when resolving 'value'\r\n  .agg(count(\"value\"))\r\n  .show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+---+------------+\r\n|key|count(value)|\r\n+---+------------+\r\n|  0|           1|\r\n+---+------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile column suggestion shows both 'value' columns:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.range(1).select($\"id\".as(\"value\")).as[Long]\r\n  .groupByKey(id => id)\r\n  .agg(count(\"unknown\"))\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Column 'unknown' does not exist.\r\nDid you mean one of the following? [value, value]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `mapValues` introduces another 'value' column, which should be referencable, but it breaks the exclusion introduced by `agg`:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.range(1)\r\n  // groupByKey adds column 'value'\r\n  .groupByKey(id => id)\r\n  // adds another 'value' column\r\n  .mapValues(value => value)\r\n  // which cannot be referenced in agg\r\n  .agg(count(\"value\"))\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Reference 'value' is ambiguous, could be: value, value.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFixes suggestions in above error messages from\r\n```\r\n... Did you mean one of the following? [value, value]\r\n... Did you mean one of the following? [value, id];\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n... Did you mean one of the following? [value]\r\n...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport Pandas UDF in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nSince Pandas UDF and scalar inline Python UDF share the same proto message,
