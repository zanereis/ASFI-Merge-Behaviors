It adds a **temporary** `airflow-ng` console script entry point to enable easier/better comparisons between the existing `airflow` console script entry point and the `airflow-ng` one.\r\n\r\nWe will need to convert all the others subcommands, and I don't know of a good way to do so except converting them all at the same time.\r\n\r\n## How You Can Help ##\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to assist this conversion process, check out #22708 to see what still needs to be done. If you'd like to contribute, drop a comment **in #22708** letting us know what you're working on.\r\n\r\nPlease open PRs against this `astronomer:convert-to-click-cli` branch, that enables us to propose all of these conversions in one go while letting Git/GitHub keep track of properly attributing commits from all contributors.\r\n\r\n### Coding Notes ###\r\n\r\nWe don't need to use absolutely every feature of Click out of the gate, since this PR is more about converting over to using Click. Fancifying the CLI and using more advanced features of Click (I'm specifically thinking of progress bars, which AFAIK the current CLI doesn't handle at all) can be done in future PRs.\r\n\r\n#### TL;DR ####\r\n\r\n1. Copy `airflow/cli/commands/<subcommand>_command.py` to `airflow/cli/commands/<subcommand>.py` and edit the new file.\r\n2. ```python\r\n   import rich_click as click\r\n   ```\r\n3. `airflow <subcommand> --help` or `airflow <group> --help` and `airflow <group> <subcommand> --help` and check the flags.\r\n4. Convert the subcommand to Click, and import any common/shared options from [`airflow/cli/__init__.py`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/__init__.py)\r\n5. Import your subcommand in [`airflow/cli/__main__.py`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/__main__.py) - note that you don't have to actually use it anywhere, and you should add the `# noqa: F401` to prevent flake8 from failing\r\n6. `airflow-ng <subcommand> --help` or `airflow <group> --help` and `airflow-ng <group> <subcommand> --help` to check that all of the flags match.\r\n\r\n#### Walkthrough ####\r\n\r\n We're using Rich-Click, which seems to just [wrap the Click API](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click#import-as-click), so:\r\n   ```python\r\n   import rich_click as click\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nConvert the subcommand, checking the [Click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) as you need. Keep in mind that there are common/shared predefined in [`airflow/cli/__init__.py`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/__init__.py) for you, but you can also add Click options directly to your subcommand if the argument/option is only used in one command.\r\n\r\nThe `args` object will simply go away and the function will accept normal Python arguments. Default values should be provided in the Click decorator and _not_ in the Python function definition (I _think_ this is the intent of the Click developers, but I'm not 100% sure so if you can confirm this please let me know). Do note that if your subcommand uses the `--daemon` option, the function argument is named `daemon_` to differentiate it from the `daemon` module.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to import your new subcommand module in [`airflow/cli/__main__.py`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/__main__.py) to get Click to register it, but you don't need to actually use the imported module anywhere. And because of that oddity, you'll need to add a `# noqa: F401` comment to the import line to prevent flake8 from complaining.\r\n\r\nUse docstrings to your advantage! If your function docstring contains one initial line, two newlines, and more text like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef upgrade(...):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Upgrade the metadata database to latest version\r\n\r\n    Upgrade the schema of the metadata database.\r\n    To print but not execute commands, use option ``--show-sql-only``.\r\n    If using options ``--from-revision`` or ``--from-version``, you must also use\r\n    ``--show-sql-only``, because if actually *running* migrations, we should only\r\n    migrate from the *current* revision.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat will get rendered similar to this, where the first line of the docstring is displayed in a brighter color than the rest of the description:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 29 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751665-a8b5ba05-78dd-4ebf-93a3-b5a3ff2db592.png)\r\n\r\nTo get automatic Rich highlighting, you should convert any `print` calls to `console.print` calls.\r\n\r\nTo use your converted subcommand, use the `airflow-ng` (entry point) command. This will eventually replace the previous `airflow` (entry point) command in a future release of Airflow, but I've kept it separate for now to make it easier to compare them and check for reverse compatibility.\r\n\r\n#### Testing ####\r\n\r\nI haven't dug super far into the existing tests yet, but the CLI does have at least has some automated test coverage already in [`tests/cli/test_cli_parser.py`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/tests/cli/test_cli_parser.py) and [`tests/cli/commands/`](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/tree/convert-to-click-cli/tests/cli/commands).\r\n\r\nIf there is some functionality that isn't currently covered by tests and would be easy to write, we should do that. Additionally, if our tests would be improved by using some of the features from Click, that would be good implement.\r\n\r\nIf somebody has a good way to test the CLI at the Bash layer, I would be interested but that _might_ be outside the scope of this PR (might be good for future work though), and tests like that would be super helpful if we ever convert the CLI to use something else in the future as well (not that I see that happening, and until then those tests would be redundant and possibly brittle).\r\n\r\nBesides that, all subcommands should be manually tested by one person, and ideally by two people. The sign up for that is also in issue #22708 although I think the results of manual testing would be best given here in a comment.\r\n\r\n#### Examples ####\r\n\r\n* [Common arguments and options shared across subcommands](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/__init__.py), defined in one location\r\n* [Options that are shared across subcommands **in a group**](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/db.py#L41)\r\n* [A decorator that contains logic common to multiple commands](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/db.py#L110)\r\n* A converted group and subcommands, `db`: [previous](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/db_command.py) and [converted](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/db.py)\r\n* Converted subcommand:\r\n  - `scheduler`: [previous](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/scheduler_command.py) and [converted](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/scheduler.py)\r\n  - `triggerer`: [previous](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/triggerer_command.py) and [converted](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/triggerer.py)\r\n  - `webserver`: [previous](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/webserver_command.py) and [converted](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/webserver.py)\r\n  - `standalone`: [previous](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/standalone_command.py) and [converted](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/convert-to-click-cli/airflow/cli/commands/standalone.py)\r\n\r\n#### Other potentially helpful links ####\r\n\r\n* [Rich Documentation](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\r\n* [Rich-Click Documentation](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click)\r\n\r\n## Motivation ##\r\n\r\nWhile argparse is quite extensive in what it supports, third party frameworks like Click have faster development cycles and therefore have implemented 21st century features that argparse does not, and likely will not, support. Things like a simple Python API, automatic coloring for `--help` output, use of non-symbolic ASCII characters, and a better understanding of common CLI author needs are all available with Click but aren't easily supported in argparse.\r\n\r\nWith the Rich framework, it is trivial for command authors to output text formatted with colors and other font effects.\r\n\r\nThe existing argparse implementation is a [bit of a mess with `ARG_` variables](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c58b5e583bcad83048fdee72bc9ddf6c3a7b4229/airflow/cli/cli_parser.py#L180) for DRY, and diving into the CLI commands isn't very easy. This Click implementation also creates some examples for future conversions:\r\n\r\n* a globally reusable option (the `click_yes` decorator)\r\n* some options that are reused within a single module (`click_revision`, `click_version`, `click_from_revision`, `click_from_version`, `click_show_sql_only`)\r\n* a decorator that checks for issues with common options between the `db upgrade` and `db downgrade` subcommands\r\n\r\nAll other options are implemented as decorators for for individual functions, illustrating how to add options to subcommands in many different ways that might make sense. You can also define options that apply to command groups.\r\n\r\nSince most options are bespoke to their subcommand, it makes sense to me that they should be defined closer to where they are used instead of all in a single file. Adding options to a command via decorators makes this very easy to do.\r\n\r\n#### Reverse Compatibility ####\r\n\r\nI believe we can largely, if not entirely, keep reverse compatibility with the previous argparse-based CLI. However, if we can't completely maintain reverse compatibility, this might be a better change to implement in Airflow 3.0.\r\n\r\n## Comparison ##\r\n\r\nWe get some things \"for free\" by converting over to Click instead of argparse.\r\n\r\n#### Formatting ####\r\n\r\n* Note the descriptions correctly rewrapping in the `airflow db upgrade --help` example as opposed to the existing argparse implementation.\r\n* The different sections of command output are rendered in their own ASCII boxes, including command errors.\r\n\r\n#### Colors! ####\r\n\r\nClick automatically colorizes output without any additional hinting.\r\n\r\n* Note how the use of colors separates pieces of information like:\r\n  - The long-form option\r\n  - The short-form option\r\n  - The type of the option value\r\n* Colors also draw your attention to the most important part of command output in a context-dependent manner\r\n  - Note how the names of the different subcommands are in bright blue, and the error output is easily recognizable in a red ASCII box.\r\n  - Some warnings (not shown) are also displayed in yellow text to differentiate them from normal output and error output, although this really depends on when the warnings are emitted at import time.\r\n\r\n### `airflow db --help` ###\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand before/after</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Before ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 24 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751270-cc15769d-e1bf-4eca-9617-366f6579592f.png)\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 25 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751314-1f13d25e-5eeb-44ee-a9a5-d982fe07c051.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### `airflow db upgrade --help` ###\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand before/after</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Before ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 37 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160752345-1aa5c05a-0b40-4fae-a44d-5858646571ee.png)\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 9 29 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160751665-a8b5ba05-78dd-4ebf-93a3-b5a3ff2db592.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### `airflow db upgrade --hep` (misspelled option) ###\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Click to expand before/after</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Before ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 10 05 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160755340-a5b00001-2a4f-4a03-b2eb-84319f408dd9.png)\r\n\r\n#### After ####\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-29 at 10 05 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/597113/160755370-dea8bf52-1b8e-4b6e-bd1a-056f0078b899.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Future Work ##\r\n\r\n#### Pre-Commit Hooks To Check For Non-Local Imports ####\r\n\r\nTo help keep subcommands fast, on top of delaying non-local imports for as long as possible, we should also add a [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24591#discussion_r906717837) similar to the [pre-commit hook for Breeze](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L638) that checks imports for all Click-based commands.\r\n\r\n#### Command Grouping ####\r\n\r\nWe can further separate the `airflow` subcommands into different groups so they are rendered into ASCII boxes with their group label (see the \"Groups and sorting\" section of the [rich-click documentation](https://pypi.org/project/rich-click/)).\r\n\r\n#### Styling Customization ####\r\n\r\nSome Airflow vendors may customize the `airflow` command. The rich-click library allows for extensive style customization, and we can also [use a `Console()` singleton to keep theme/console settings in a single place](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24591#discussion_r906365299), and [introduce a color-blind friendly mode](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24591#discussion_r906716931).\r\n\r\n#### Click Goodies ####\r\n\r\n* The Click API makes it easier to [test the CLI](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/testing/) programmatically entirely within Python.\r\n* [Autocomplete with Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/) looks like it would be pretty easy to implement.\r\n* [Progress bars](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/utils/#showing-progress-bars) - imagine launching a DAG via the CLI and then viewing a progress bar while it finishes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

Overview\r\n\r\nHistorically when adding custom extra fields we had to store them in the `extra` json field as `extra__conn_type__field_name`.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat cumbersome.  And it meant that when adding them as UI form fields, you had to make a change to the structure of the `extra` schema.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we do away with the requirement of this prefix.  In effect, we separate the field \"key\" -- how it is identified internally in the model and form -- with \"name\", how it is identified in the `extra` json field.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with a backward compatible change, so that we can update hook classes (or class families) one at a time.\r\n\r\n### Notes on behavior\r\n\r\nFor hooks which have not updated `get_connection_form_widgets` to remove the prefixes, there's no change in behavior.\r\n\r\nBut for hooks that _have_, then in the Web UI, when reading the connection (e.g. for an update) Airflow will check first for non-prefixed value then if it doesn't find it, it will check for prefixed value.\r\n\r\nOn save, it will always store in the manner defined by `get_connection_form_widgets`.  In the case where the `extra` field was defined pre-hook-upgrade, I leave the old (prefixed) value alone, so as to be non-destructive.  However I can see an argument for removing the old vaule.\r\n\r\nWhen we update hooks to remove the prefix, we need to add a `_get_field` method to handle the extra lookup properly.  Considering what happens with new hook and old airflow, we either have to bump min airflow version, or add Airflow-backcompat logic to re-prefix when using with an old version of Airflow.  And I suppose this can be decided on a case-by-case basis with each provider.\r\n\r\n### Other note\r\n\r\nWhen implementing `get_ui_field_behaviour` for custom fields, you still will have to reference the prefixed field name.

now in graph view, a user can click on a mapped task and see a summary in a modal. But they cannot see an individual mapped task. This PR fixes that with:\r\n\r\n- Adds a new \"All Mapped Instances\" button to the `/taskinstance/list`, but filtered to just that DAG run\r\n- Adds a dropdown to select a mapped instance by `map_index` and update the modal\r\n- Adds a back button to return the modal back to the task summary\r\n\r\nRelated: #22409\r\n\r\nAlso, updates `callModal` to use object props to avoid having to specifically order arguments or passing `undefined`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"607\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-28 at 4 37 03 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4600967/160493818-63463b14-e41b-41d7-a2a6-9dd628647a12.png\">\r\n\r\n![Mar-28-2022 16-39-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4600967/160493805-6c776a46-3923-4b61-88af-3156289edde6.gif)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/UPDATING.md).\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-28T21:55:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T08:08:12Z","closed_at":"2022-03-30T14:59:15Z","merged_at":"2022-03-30T14:59:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"d041dbe6b14238e271a2536cbfad994cbc86e312","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes that should be skipped from the changelog (CI, tests, etc..)"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

and Celery are both providers and part of the core.\r\nThe dependencies for both are added via \"extras\" which makes them\r\n\"soft\" limits and in case of serious dependency bumps this might\r\nend up with a mess (as we experienced with bumping min K8S\r\nlibrary version from 11.0.0 to 22.* (resulting in yanking 4\r\nversions of `cncf.kubernetes` provider.\r\n\r\nAfter this learning, we approach K8S and Celery dependencies a bit\r\ndifferently than any other dependencies.\r\n\r\n* for Celery and K8S (and Dask but this is rather an afterhought)\r\n  we do not strip-off the dependencies from the extra (so for\r\n  example [cncf.kubernetes] extra will have dependencies on\r\n  both 'apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes' as well as\r\n  directly on kubernetes library\r\n\r\n* We add upper-bound limits for both Celery and Kubernetes to prevent\r\n  from accidental upgrades. Both Celery and Kubernetes Python library\r\n  follow SemVer, and they are crucial components of Airlfow so they\r\n  both squarely fit our \"do not upper-bound\" exceptions.\r\n\r\n* We also add a rule that whenever dependency upper-bound limit is\r\n  raised, we should also make sure that additional testing is done\r\n  and appropriate `apache-airflow` lower-bound limit is added for\r\n  the `apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes` and\r\n  `apache-airflow-providers-celery` providers.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change we also had to fix two issues:\r\n* the image was needlesly rebuilt during constraint generation as\r\n  we already have the image and we even warn that it should\r\n  be built before we run constraint generation\r\n\r\n* after this change, the currently released, unyanked cncf.kubernetes\r\n  provider cannot be installed with airflow, because it has\r\n  conflicting requirements for kubernetes library (provider has\r\n  <11 and airflow has > 22.7). Therefore during constraint\r\n  generation with PyPI providers we install providers from PyPI, we\r\n  explicitly install the yanked 3.1.2 version. This should be\r\n  removed after we release the next K8S provider version.\r\n\r\nThat should protect our users in all scenarios where they might\r\nunknowingly attempt to upgrade Kubernetes or Celery to incompatible\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nThat should protect our users in all scenarios where they might\r\nunknowingly attempt to upgrade Kubernetes or Celery to incompatible\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nRelated to: #22560, #21727\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

only dependency actually used in the `microsoft-azure` provider appears to be `azure-keyvault-secrets`.  This merge updates the provider to depend only on that package and not the full `azure-keyvault` metapackage.  This has the potential added benefits of allowing that package to be constrained more specifically and also removing dependence on a metapackage that is causing problem for packagers (on conda-forge in specific).\r\n\r\ncloses #22551\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

connection \"extra\" fields which were added as custom fields in the\r\nwebserver connection form had to be named with prefix `extra__<conn_type>__`.\r\nThis was because custom fields are registered globally on the connection view model,\r\nso the prefix was necessary to prevent collisions.\r\n\r\nBut the prefix is ugly and cumbersome in the `extra` field.  So now what we do is\r\nadd this prefix when defining the field internally in the model, and strip it when\r\nsaving the connection.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* alternatively we could leave widget definitions with the prefix spelled out and then just strip it on save.  this would be slightly simpler but maybe tiny bit less intuitive for folks defining extra fields?\r\n* it would be nice to avoid having to add this `_EXTRA_PREFIX_DEPRECATED` attribute on hooks as we update them but i'm not sure there's another way, since users may keep an old provider but upgrade airflow.\r\n\r\nAfter this I'll have to update the providers one at a time so they all use a `_get_field` type of function to handle the backcompat for connections defined in the old way, and to add that indicator attribute so webserver will handle the saving correctly.","created_at":"2022-03-26T20:24:35Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T02:50:40Z","closed_at":"2022-03-28T02:50:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1b221a942df8c7d82a70fea378fce45fff400d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"josh-fell","id":48934154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTM0MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/

the build is run via direct push to apache airflow repo\r\nwe do not need to run two separate workflows. The \"push\" workflow\r\nis never a \"pull request from fork\" so it should have\r\nthe capability to build and push images to registry.\r\n\r\nThis allows the committers to make direct push requests to run PRs\r\nthat are actually running the build without having to merge\r\nbuild-image.yml first.\r\n\r\nThis is cool because committers can simply push a branch to apache\r\nand test if it works with some build image changes that otherwise\r\nwould require to push to `main` of an apache-airflow fork.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that merge and schedule builds do not run two\r\nseparate workflows - both building the image and running tests is done\r\nin the same workflow (and the build-image workflow is not started)\r\nThis saves some build time on \"wait for CI images\" and\r\n\"wait for PROD images\" jobs - because in merge builds and\r\nschedule builds they only start after the images are actually\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the build is run via direct push to apache airflow repo\r\nwe do not need to run two separate workflows. The \"push\" workflow\r\nis never a \"pull request from fork\" so it should have\r\nthe capability to build and push images to registry.\r\n\r\nThis allows the committers to make direct push requests to run PRs\r\nthat are actually running the build without having to merge\r\nbuild-image.yml first.\r\n\r\nThis is cool because committers can simply push a branch to apache\r\nand test if it works with some build image changes that otherwise\r\nwould require to push to `main` of an apache-airflow fork.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that merge and schedule builds do not run two\r\nseparate workflows - both building the image and running tests is done\r\nin the same workflow (and the build-image workflow is not started)\r\nThis saves some build time on \"wait for CI images\" and\r\n\"wait for PROD images\" jobs - because in merge builds and\r\nschedule builds they only start after the images are actually\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the build is run via direct push to apache airflow repo\r\nwe do not need to run two separate workflows. The \"push\" workflow\r\nis never a \"pull request from fork\" so it should have\r\nthe capability to build and push images to registry.\r\n\r\nThis allows the committers to make direct push requests to run PRs\r\nthat are actually running the build without having to merge\r\nbuild-image.yml first.\r\n\r\nThis is cool because committers can simply push a branch to apache\r\nand test if it works with some build image changes that otherwise\r\nwould require to push to `main` of an apache-airflow fork.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that merge and schedule builds do not run two\r\nseparate workflows - both building the image and running tests is done\r\nin the same workflow (and the build-image workflow is not started)\r\nThis saves some build time on \"wait for CI images\" and\r\n\"wait for PROD images\" jobs - because in merge builds and\r\nschedule builds they only start after the images are actually\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to #22102, and be forewarned, this might be a bikeshed. If this gets contentious at all, I'll just close it and move on.\r\n\r\nI think it's a little bit easier for users to have consistent flags/arguments for the `airflow db upgrade` and `airflow db downgrade` commands. This PR just tweaks the argument processing to expect `--to-revision` and `--to-version` instead of `--revision` and `--version`, respectively.\r\n\r\nThat change makes the arguments to those commands more consistent with the `--from-revision` and `--from-version` arguments. Doing so also avoids overloading the `--version` flag, which is usually a flag that prints out the version information of the command itself (eg: Airflow's version, which is available via `airflow version`).\r\n\r\nAn argument against this change is that the `--to-...` arguments can be understood to be implied, like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nairflow db upgrade --from-version 10.15.8  # Upgrade from 10.15.8 to the current Airflow version\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this means that you do not necessarily need to always specify the `--to-...` arguments. By having both `--to-` and `--from-` arguments, users might think that they always need to specify both a `--to-` and `--from-` argument.\r\n\r\nI also fixed an unrelated grammar typo, which corrects the grammar used to log the operation.","created_at":"2022-03-25T23:11:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T06:38:47Z","closed_at":"2022-03-31T19:51:29Z","merged_at":"2022-03-31T19:51:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"60d90896486cc3d9f1fc0029ca9833c7d561caa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

#11547\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to use `DATETIME`, `DATE`. and `TIME` fields in bigquery when the postgres columns is defined timezone naive.(`timestamp`, `date`, `time` <=> to `timestamp without timezone`, `date without timezone` and `time without timezone`)\r\n\r\nI had to modify the `convert_type` function as BigQuery cannot import data for `DATETIME`, `DATE`. and `TIME` fields from a timestamp.\r\n\r\nI also added some tests for that function.

running `airflow db init`, Airflow will parse all of the DAGs in the configured dag folder sequentially in a single process. When there are a large number of DAGs present this can _significantly_ slow down the time it takes for the `db init` command to run. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, initializing the DB and populating it with data are separate tasks and shouldn't be combined into a single function. The background DAG processor is also much faster at parsing files and populating the DB due to using multiprocessing. \r\n\r\nI propose splitting the bootstrapping of the DagBag out into a separate function (so as to not introduce any changes to the test setup / teardown process) and removing it from the `db init` and `db reset` commands.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, removing this PR might be required for AIP-43 anyways\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything I'm missing here, or if there's an explanation for parsing DAGs here which I may have missed.

namespaced custom connection fields (which are stored in the `extra` json field) with prefix `extra__<conn type>__` in order to keep them unique in a global dictionary of fields.\r\n\r\nThis made it ugly and clunky to use these fields when you deal with the `extra` field directly, e.g. when using an external secrets backend or storing connections in env vars.\r\n\r\nWith a slight change in logic, we can keep this namespacing (which ensures that different connections can have fields with the same name and different labels) and strip the prefix prior to saving (and add it back on read) so that the `extra` JSON doesn't have the prefix.\r\n\r\nThat's the easy part.  What was a little more challenging (or at least tedious) was to preserve backward compatibility, so users will be warned when their extras still have the deprecated prefix, but it will continue to work.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-25T04:22:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T20:27:57Z","closed_at":"2022-03-26T20:27:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c1076e241369f899cfc0feba447416f74d9af73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

not 100% sure we need to change the signature in this way, but please read on to see what this is about.\r\n\r\nThe base `defer` method takes params trigger, method, kwargs, and timeout, and builds a TaskDeferred exception.\r\n\r\nIn practice, building the trigger instance can be cumbersome.  And sometimes you want to reuse your deferral logic in multiple places in your operator.  In this case it's convenient to implement `defer` with different arguments and let it handle the construction of the trigger instance.  By making the `defer` signature a little more flexible, we enable subclasses to make `defer` more powerful without technically having signature inconsistencies between the base class method and the subclass implementation.\r\n\r\nSo for example, in a KPO async operator we want to defer in two places -- once, initially after we start the pod, and possibly later if we only resumed execution to get the latest logs.  \r\n\r\nSo it would be convenient in the first instance to simply call `self.defer()` and later call `self.defer(last_log_time='2021-01-01 01:02:03')`.\r\n\r\nBut currently the signature forces us to create the trigger instance in the call to `defer` which is very ugly.\r\n\r\nSee here the first call:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        self.defer(\r\n            trigger=WaitContainerTrigger(\r\n                kubernetes_conn_id=None,\r\n                hook_params={\r\n                    \"cluster_context\": self.cluster_context,\r\n                    \"config_file\": self.config_file,\r\n                    \"in_cluster\": self.in_cluster,\r\n                },\r\n                pod_name=self.pod.metadata.name,\r\n                container_name=self.BASE_CONTAINER_NAME,\r\n                pod_namespace=self.pod.metadata.namespace,\r\n                pending_phase_timeout=self.startup_timeout_seconds,\r\n                poll_interval=self.poll_interval,\r\n                logging_interval=self.logging_interval,\r\n                last_log_time=None,\r\n            ),\r\n            method_name=self.trigger_reentry.__name__,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here the second:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        self.defer(\r\n            trigger=WaitContainerTrigger(\r\n                kubernetes_conn_id=None,\r\n                hook_params={\r\n                    \"cluster_context\": self.cluster_context,\r\n                    \"config_file\": self.config_file,\r\n                    \"in_cluster\": self.in_cluster,\r\n                },\r\n                pod_name=self.pod.metadata.name,\r\n                container_name=self.BASE_CONTAINER_NAME,\r\n                pod_namespace=self.pod.metadata.namespace,\r\n                pending_phase_timeout=self.startup_timeout_seconds,\r\n                poll_interval=self.poll_interval,\r\n                logging_interval=self.logging_interval,\r\n                last_log_time='2021-01-01 01:02:03',\r\n            ),\r\n            method_name=self.trigger_reentry.__name__,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy abstracting away (into defer) the trigger creation logic our calls can be much cleaner.\r\n\r\nHere's what my defer would look like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def defer(self, last_log_time=None, **kwargs):  # kwargs here are not used -- it's only for \"compatibility\" with base class\r\n        \"\"\"Defers to WaitContainerTrigger optionally with last log time.\"\"\"\r\n        if kwargs:\r\n            raise ValueError(\r\n                f\"Received keyword arguments {list(kwargs.keys())} but \"\r\n                f\"they are not used in this implementation of `defer`.\"\r\n            )\r\n        super().defer(\r\n            trigger=WaitContainerTrigger(\r\n                kubernetes_conn_id=None,\r\n                hook_params={\r\n                    \"cluster_context\": self.cluster_context,\r\n                    \"config_file\": self.config_file,\r\n                    \"in_cluster\": self.in_cluster,\r\n                },\r\n                pod_name=self.pod.metadata.name,\r\n                container_name=self.BASE_CONTAINER_NAME,\r\n                pod_namespace=self.pod.metadata.namespace,\r\n                pending_phase_timeout=self.startup_timeout_seconds,\r\n                poll_interval=self.poll_interval,\r\n                logging_interval=self.logging_interval,\r\n                last_log_time=last_log_time,\r\n            ),\r\n            method_name=self.trigger_reentry.__name__,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-24T17:39:57Z","updated_at":"2022-04-15T18:16:01Z","closed_at":"2022-04-15T18:16:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f311cf26c4f140398f573fd84bbbb085ffe35fe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/22509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/22509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/22509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1466ae940d8af709af2c3a8f9733ffc663b49b64","head":{"label":"astronomer:base-operator-defer-flexibility","ref":"base-operator-defer-flexibility","sha":"1466ae940d8af709af2c3a8f9733ffc663b49b64","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

change is one of the biggest optimizations to the Dockerfiles\r\nthat from the very beginning was a goal, but it has been enabled\r\nby switching to buildkit and recent relase of support for\r\nthe 1.4 dockerfile syntax. This syntax introduced two features:\r\n\r\n* heredocs\r\n* links for COPY commands\r\n\r\nBoth changes allows to solve multiple problems:\r\n\r\n* COPY for build scripts suffer from permission problems. Depending\r\n  on umask setting of the host, the scripts could have different\r\n  group permissions and invalidate docker cache. Inlining the\r\n  scripts (automatically by pre-commit) gets rid of the problem\r\n  completely\r\n\r\n* COPY --link allows to optimize and parallelize builds for\r\n  Dockerfile.ci embedded source code. This should speed up\r\n  not only building the images locally but also it will allow\r\n  to use more efficiently cache for the CI builds (in case no\r\n  source code change, the builds will use pre-cached layers from\r\n  the cache more efficiently (and in parallel)\r\n\r\n* The PROD Dockerfile is now completely standalone. You do not\r\n  need to have any folders or files to build Airlfow image. At\r\n  the same time the versatility and support for multiple ways\r\n  on how you can build the image (as described in\r\n  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html is\r\n  maintained (this was a goal from the very beginning of the\r\n  PROD Dockerfile but it was not easily achievable - heredocs\r\n  allow to inline scripts that are used for the build and the\r\n  pre-commits will make sure that there is one source of truth\r\n  and nicely editable scripts for both PROD and CI Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nThe last point is really cool, because it allows our users to\r\nbuild custom dockerfiles without checking out the code of\r\nAirflow, it is enough to download the latest released\r\nDockerfile and they can easily build the image.\r\n\r\nOverall - this change will vastly optimize build speed for\r\nboth PROD and CI images in multiple scenarios.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This is demostrated in new UT `test_find_executable_task_instances_order_priority_with_pools` - before this PR `dummy3` and `dummy1` are queued instead of `dummy3` and `dummy2`.\r\n\r\nRemoving the

was a bug in our fork handling that prevented finalizer\r\nfor objects kept in frame of unhandled excepion. Previously,\r\nthe os._exit() was called in finally clause, and if there was\r\nan unhandled exception raised, the exception was still kept in\r\nmemory while finally clause was processed together with the\r\nobjects in the same stack frame as the thrown exception that\r\ncould lead to those objects not being finalized.\r\n\r\nThis is mitigated by moving the os._exit() outside of the finally\r\nclause.\r\n\r\nFixes: #22404\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
