Because we always invoke V1 drop logic if the identifier looks like a V1 identifier. This is a big blocker for external data sources that provide custom session catalogs.\r\nSo this PR move all Drop Table case to DataSource V2 (use drop table to drop view not include). More information please check https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37879/files#r1170501180\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

The `duplicateResolved` in `Join` node are false. That's meaning the `Join` left and right have same `Attribute`, in this eg is `c1#224`. The right `c1#224` `Attribute` generated by having Inputs, because there are wrong having Inputs. \r\n\r\nThis problem only occurs when there contain having clause.\r\n\r\nalso do some code format fix.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make Scala 2.13 the default Scala version in Apache Spark 3.5.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current releases of Scala community are `Scala 3.2.2` and `Scala 2.13.10`.\r\n\r\n- https://scala-lang.org/download/all.html\r\n \r\nAlthough the Apache Spark community has been using Scala 2.12 by default since Apache Spark 3.0 and Scala community will release Scala 2.12.18 for Java 21 support, we had better focus on `Scala 2.13+` more from Apache Spark 3.5 timeline to adopt Scala community's activity.\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-25075 added Scala 2.13 at Apache Spark 3.2.0, the Apache Spark community has been using it as a second Scala version. This PR aims to switch only the default Scala version from 2.12 to 2.13. Apache Spark will support both Scala 2.12 and 2.13 still.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but we still have Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `SparkConnectPlanner.transformRelation` always return the `LogicalPlan` of `Dataset`.\r\nThe `SparkConnectStreamHandler.handlePlan` constructs a new `Dataset` for it.\r\nSometimes, `SparkConnectStreamHandler.handlePlan` could reuse the `Dataset` created by `SparkConnectPlanner.transformRelation`.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a common method `transformRelationAsDataset` could be reused in many places.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove `SparkConnectPlanner` by reuse `Dataset` and avoid construct new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport `UserDefinedType` in `createDataFrame` from pandas DataFrame and `toPandas`.\r\n\r\nFor the following schema and pandas DataFrame:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nschema = (\r\n    StructType()\r\n    .add(\"point\", ExamplePointUDT())\r\n    .add(\"struct\", StructType().add(\"point\", ExamplePointUDT()))\r\n    .add(\"array\", ArrayType(ExamplePointUDT()))\r\n    .add(\"map\", MapType(StringType(), ExamplePointUDT()))\r\n)\r\ndata = [\r\n    Row(\r\n        ExamplePoint(1.0, 2.0),\r\n        Row(ExamplePoint(3.0, 4.0)),\r\n        [ExamplePoint(5.0, 6.0)],\r\n        dict(point=ExamplePoint(7.0, 8.0)),\r\n    )\r\n]\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)\r\n\r\npdf = pd.DataFrame.from_records(data, columns=schema.names)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### `spark.createDataFrame()`\r\n\r\nFor all, return the same results:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema).show(truncate=False)\r\n+----------+------------+------------+---------------------+\r\n|point     |struct      |array       |map

'row')\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n       point        struct        array                   map\r\n0  (1.0,2.0)  ((3.0,4.0),)  [(5.0,6.0)]  {'point': (7.0,8.0)}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `UserDefinedType` in `spark.createDataFrame()` with pandas DataFrame and `df.toPandas()` is not supported with Arrow enabled or in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n#####

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nreorganize `ps.DataFrame` unit tests, to follow the categories

even after https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/58b6535cbf76f2b26fc08b94905a57dcc4d955f6, `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe` and `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe_slow` are still too slow, each one normally takes >5 minutes, and sometimes >10 minutes.\r\n\r\n2, the tests were not well organized, and [tests in Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/main/pandas/tests) are grouped by categories, we should follow it to make PS tests more maintainable\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProject connect, from some perspectives, can be thought as replacing the SQL parser to generate a parsed (but the difference that is unresolved) plan, then the plan is passed to the analyzer. This means that connect should also do validation on the proto as there are many in-validate parser cases that analyzer does not expect to see, which potentially could cause problems if connect only pass through the proto (of course have it translated) to analyzer.\r\nMeanwhile I think this is a good idea to decouple the validation and transformation so that we have two stages:\r\nstage 1: proto validation. For example validate if necessary fields are populated or not.\r\nstage 2: transformation, which convert the proto to a plan with assumption that the plan is valid parsed version of the plan.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks before transformation through a simple proxy pattern.\r\n\r\nBecause there are a lot of job to do, this PR only given an example(e.g. `checkReadRel`).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nreorganize `ps.DataFrame` unit tests, to follow the categories in\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.pandas/frame.html\r\nand https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, even after https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/58b6535cbf76f2b26fc08b94905a57dcc4d955f6, `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe` and `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe_slow` are still too slow, each one normally takes >5 minutes, and sometimes >10 minutes.\r\n\r\n2, the tests were not well organized, and [tests in Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/main/pandas/tests) are grouped by categories, we should follow it to make PS tests more maintainable\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd the ```to_varchar``` alias for ```to_char``` to support additional SQL functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo minimize code changes for people using Spark SQL who are used to other engines that support ```to_varchar```.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user can now invoke ```to_varchar``` instead of ```to_char``` in their SQL applications.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```to_varchar``` was added in ```numeric.sql``` and a new Golden file was generated to check that the query output was

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nStreaming awaitTermination() is a long running API. Currently, it keeps running on server even if client disconnects. This change periodically checks if client has disconnected. If so, we can stop the operation and release resources.\r\n\r\nWe use gRPC Context.isCancelled() to determine if client has disconnected and response cannot be returned to the client. [Here is the reference of of isCancelled()](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_server_context.html#af2d0f087805b4b475d01b12d73508f09): \r\n\r\n> Return whether this RPC failed before the server could provide its status back to the client.\r\n\r\n> This could be because of explicit API cancellation from the client-side or server-side, because of deadline exceeded, network connection reset, HTTP/2 parameter configuration (e.g., max message size, max connection age), etc. It does NOT include failure due to a non-OK status return from the server application's request handler, including [Status::CANCELLED](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html#a9994ffe95a0495915d82481c2ec594ab).\r\n\r\n> IsCancelled is always safe to call when using sync or callback API. When using async API, it is only safe to call IsCancelled after the AsyncNotifyWhenDone tag has been delivered. Thread-safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe change improves handling of awaitTermination(). It avoids resource waste of server side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\nManually tested on local with:\r\n1. start spark connect \r\n2. create a streaming query\r\n3. call query.awaitTermination()\r\n4. exit() the client to disconnect it\r\n5. check that an error (RPC context is cancelled when executing awaitTermination()) is logged on server.

It allows users to create UDTFs in PySpark and use them in PySpark and SQL.\r\n\r\nHere are examples of creating and using Python UDTFs:\r\n```python\r\n# Implement the UDTF class\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n  def __init__(self):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n  def eval(self, *args):\r\n    yield \"hello\", \"world\"  \r\n  \r\n  def terminate(self):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n# Create the UDTF\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udtf\r\n\r\ntest_udtf = udtf(TestUDTF, returnType=\"c1: string, c2: string\")\r\n\r\n# Invoke the UDTF\r\ntest_udtf().show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|   c1|   c2|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|hello|world|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n# Register the UDTF\r\nspark.udtf.register(name=\"test_udtf\", f=test_udtf)\r\n\r\n# Invoke the UDTF in SQL\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM test_udtf()\").show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|   c1|   c2|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|hello|world|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is the initial PR, and there will be subsequent follow-up work to make it more user-friendly and performant.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support another type of user-defined function in PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. After this PR, users can create Python user-defined table functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Move code related to execution from being done directly in the GRPC callback in SparkConnextStreamHandler, to it's own classes.\r\n* `ExecutionHolder` (renamed from `ExecuteHolder`) launches the execution in it's own thread using `ExecuteThreadRunner`\r\n* The execution pushes responses via `ExecuteResponseObserver` (running in the execution thread)\r\n* `ExecuteResponseObserver` notifies `ExecuteGrpcResponseSender` (running in the rpc handler thread) to send the responses.\r\n* The actual execution code is refactored into `SparkConnectPlanExecution`\r\n\r\nThis allows to improve query interruption, by making `interrupt` method interrupt the execution thread. This makes `interrupt` work also when no Spark Jobs are running.\r\n\r\nThe refactoring further opens the possibilities of detaching query execution from a single RPC execution. Right now `ExecutionHolder` is waiting for the execution thread to finish, and `ExecutePlanResponseObserver` is forwarding the responses directly to the RPC observer.\r\n\r\nIn a followup, we can design different modes of execution, e.g.\r\n`ExecutePlanResponseObserver` buffering the responses. A client which lost connection could then reconnect and ask for the stream to be retransmitted.\r\n* `ExecutionHolder` returning the operationId to the client directly, and then client requesting results in separate RPCs, with more control over the response stream, instead of having it just pushed to it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* Improve the working of `interrupt`\r\n* Refactoring that opens up possibilities of detaching query execution from a single RPC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting Spark Connect CI covers the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to pick a proper number of partitions when create a DataFrame from R DataFrame with Arrow.\r\nPreviously, the number of partitions was always `1` if not specified.\r\nNow, it splits the input R DataFrame by `spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch`, and pick a proper number of partitions (the number of batches).\r\n\r\nThis is matched with PySpark code path:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/46949e692e863992f4c50bdd482d5216d4fd9221/python/pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py#L618C11-L626\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid having OOM when the R DataFrame is too large, and enables a proper distributed computing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the default partition number when users call `createDataFrame` with R DataFrame when Arrow optimization is enabled.\r\nThe concept of the partition is subject to be internal, and by default it doesn't change its behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with a large CSV file (3 GB).\r\nAlso added a unittest.","created_at":"2023-05-25T04:54:25Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:37Z","closed_at":"2023-05-25T11:03:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c616bf2b06f0147ffc5add520067e7eaae24bc74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7224b147ab16fbecfa7f9ff5d4f61b26a614bed","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:default-batch-size","ref":"default-batch-size","sha":"a7224b147ab16fbecfa7f9ff5d4f61b26a614bed","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add a static Spark conf to configure an override to the Log4j logging level. It’s a config version of the `SparkContext.setLogLevel()` semantics, when set it’ll trigger a log level override at the beginning of `SparkContext` startup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is particularly helpful in the Spark Connect scenario where there’s no way for the client to call `setLogLevel` because `SparkContext` is not yet supported in its API, and when it connects to a platform where it can't change the Log4j config file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it adds a new public configuration `\"spark.log.level\"`, and by default it's unset which means there's no override.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA new unit test in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a way for data sources to request Spark to represent updates as deletes and inserts. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt may be beneficial for data sources to represent updates as deletes and inserts for delta-based implementations. Specifically, it may help to properly distribute and order records before writing.\r\n\r\nDelete records set only row ID and metadata attributes. Update records set data, row ID, metadata attributes. Insert records set only data attributes.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a data source may rely on a metadata column `_row_id` (synthetic internally generated) to identify the row and may be partitioned by `bucket(product_id)`. Splitting updates into inserts and deletes would allow data sources to cluster all update and insert records in MERGE for the same partition into a single task. Otherwise, the clustering key for updates and inserts will be different (inserts will always have `_row_id` as null as it is a metadata column). The new functionality is critical to reduce the number of generated files. It also makes sense in UPDATE operations if the original and new partition of a record do not match.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new method to `SupportsDelta` but the change is backward compatible.\r\n \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nParseToDate should load the EvalMode in main thread instead of loading it in a lazy val. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is because it is sometimes hard to estimate when the lazy val is executed while the SQLConf where we load the EvalMode is thread local. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the support of archive (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, or `.tar` files) in `SparkSession.addArtifacts` so we can support Python dependency management in Python Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for end users to add the dependencies and archive files in Python Spark Connect client.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the Python dependency management (https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/12/22/how-to-manage-python-dependencies-in-pyspark.html) usecase in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nSee below how to do this with Spark Connect Python client:\r\n\r\n#### Precondition\r\n\r\nAssume that we have a Spark Connect server already running, e.g., by:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --jars `ls connector/connect/server/target/**/spark-connect*SNAPSHOT.jar` --master \"local-cluster[2,2,1024]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand assume that you already have a dev env:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Notice that you should install `conda-pack`.\r\nconda create -y -n pyspark_conda_env -c conda-forge conda-pack python=3.9\r\nconda activate pyspark_conda_env\r\npip install --upgrade -r dev/requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Dependency management\r\n\r\n```python\r\n./bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://localhost:15002\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport conda_pack\r\nimport os\r\n# Pack the current environment ('pyspark_conda_env') to 'pyspark_conda_env.tar.gz'. \r\n# Or you can run 'conda pack' in your shell.\r\nconda_pack.pack()  \r\nspark.addArtifact(f\"{os.environ.get('CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV')}.tar.gz#environment\", archive=True)\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.pyspark.python\", \"environment/bin/python\")\r\n# From now on, Python workers on executors use `pyspark_conda_env` Conda environment.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun your Python UDFs\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\ndef plug_one(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n    return s + 1\r\n\r\nspark.range(10).select(plug_one(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds the support of archive (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, or `.tar` files) in `SparkSession.addArtifacts`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as described above, and added a unittest.\r\n\r\nAlso, manually tested with `local-cluster` mode with the code below:\r\n\r\nAlso verified via:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n\r\nspark.range(1).select(udf(lambda x: sys.executable)(\"id\")).show(truncate=False)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|<lambda>(id)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to fix bug in AvroSuite for 'reading from invalid path throws exception'.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- As discussed and analyzed in [41271](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41271#issuecomment-1560355918)\r\n\r\n- There is a problem with this UT. Its original intention was to test if there is no file with .avro extensions in the directory, and the read should fail. However, this UT triggered the error as FileUtils.touch instead of spark.read.format(\"avro\").load(dir.toString).The root cause for the failure of this case is that the parent directory was not created. When FileUtils.touch is called in version 1.11.0, it just throws java.io.FileNotFoundException, which covers the error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.","created_at":"2023-05-24T02:24:19Z","updated_at":"2023-06-03T13:04:10Z","closed_at":"2023-05-24T04:10:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a256e7d8254d72073481b8214865e857b3bef8af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee032f6c39ecdc105a296e2487761050f7b0f636","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-43767","ref":"SPARK-43767","sha":"ee032f6c39ecdc105a296e2487761050f7b0f636","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the default value of `daemonExitValue` from `null` to `None` in `eofExceptionWhileReadPortNumberError` to avoid a NPE.  This is possible `PythonWorkerFactory` can call this method without a value for `daemonExitValue` (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/06648efddb43166577269400e73cd56210e15728/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/python/PythonWorkerFactory.scala#L229-L230).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf no value is provided for `daemonExitValue`, the expected behavior is to still throw an exception, but without an additional message.  Currently, this results in a NPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to added a cleaning action for the `$sparkHome/sql/hive/target/$scalaDir/classes` and `$sparkHome/sql/hive/target/$scalaDir/test-classes` directories before `SimpleSparkConnectService` starts when running test cases that inherit `RemoteSparkSession` without `-Phive` to avoid to unexpected loading of `sql/hive/target/scala-2.12/classes/META-INF/services/org.apache.spark.sql.sources.DataSourceRegister` by `ServiceLoader`.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we run the test cases that inherit `RemoteSparkSession`, the classpath used to launch `SimpleSparkConnectService` will at least include the following directory, both maven and sbt:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$sparkHome/conf/\r\n$sparkHome/common/kvstore/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/network-common/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/network-shuffle/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/network-yarn/target/scala-2.12/classes\r\n$sparkHome/common/sketch/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/tags/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/unsafe/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/core/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/examples/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/graphx/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/launcher/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/mllib/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/repl/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/resource-managers/mesos/target/scala-2.12/classes\r\n$sparkHome/resource-managers/yarn/target/scala-2.12/classes\r\n$sparkHome/sql/catalyst/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/sql/core/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/sql/hive/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/sql/hive-thriftserver/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/streaming/target/scala-2.12/classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/kvstore/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/common/network-common/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/network-shuffle/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/network-yarn/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/common/sketch/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/common/tags/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/common/unsafe/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/core/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/examples/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/graphx/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/launcher/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/mllib/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/repl/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/resource-managers/mesos/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/resource-managers/yarn/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/sql/catalyst/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/sql/core/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/sql/hive/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/sql/hive-thriftserver/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/streaming/target/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n$sparkHome/connector/connect/client/jvm/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n$sparkHome/connector/connect/common/target/scala-2.12/test-classes/\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if the test case need calls `DataSource#lookupDataSource` and the `hive` module is compiled, `sql/hive/target/scala-2.12/classes/META-INF/services/org.apache.spark.sql.sources.DataSourceRegister` will be loaded by `ServiceLoader`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-43186 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40848 merged, `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveFileFormat` changed to use `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.plan.FileSinkDesc` instead of `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveShim.ShimFileSinkDesc`, it has a strong dependence on `hive-exec`. But when there is no hive related jars under `assembly/target/$scalaDir/jars/`, it will cause initialization fail of `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveFileFormat` and test fail.\r\n\r\nFor example, when we run the following commands to test `connect-client-jvm` without `-Phive`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -DskipTests\r\nbuild/mvn test -pl connector/connect/client/jvm\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen hive related jars will not be copied to `assembly/target/$scalaDir/jars/`, there will be test error as:\r\n\r\n**Client side**\r\n\r\n```\r\n- read and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-37820, `select unbase64(\"abcs==\")`(malformed input) always throws an exception.\r\n\r\nSo, `unbase64()`'s behavior for malformed input changed silently after SPARK-37820:\r\n- before: return a best-effort result, because it uses [LENIENT](https://github.com/apache/commons-codec/blob/rel/commons-codec-1.15/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base64InputStream.java#L46) policy: any trailing bits are composed into 8-bit bytes where possible. The remainder are discarded.\r\n- after: throw an exception\r\n\r\nAnd there is no way to restore the previous behavior. To tolerate the malformed input, the user should migrate `unbase64(<input>)` to `try_to_binary(<input>, 'base64')` to get NULL instead of interrupting by exception. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the behavior change to migration guide.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManuelly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `Anaylzer#commonNaturalJoinProcessing`, set nullable correctly when adding the join keys to the Project's hidden_output tag.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe value of the hidden_output tag will be used for resolution of attributes in parent operators, so incorrect nullabilty can cause problems.\r\n\r\nFor example, assume this data:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1 as values (1), (2), (3) as (c1);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t2 as values (2), (3), (4) as (c1);\r\n```\r\nThe following query produces incorrect results:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> select explode(array(t1.c1, t2.c1)) as x1\r\nfrom t1\r\nfull outer join t2\r\nusing (c1);\r\n1\r\n-1      <== should be null\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n-1      <== should be null\r\n4\r\nTime taken: 0.663 seconds, Fetched 8 row(s)\r\nspark-sql (default)> \r\n```\r\nSimilar issues occur with right outer join and left outer join.\r\n\r\n`t1.c1` and `t2.c1` have the wrong nullability at the time the array is resolved, so the array's `containsNull` value is incorrect.\r\n\r\n`UpdateNullability` will update the nullability of `t1.c1` and `t2.c1` in the `CreateArray` arguments, but will not update `containsNull` in the function's data type.\r\n\r\nQueries that don't use arrays also can get wrong results. Assume this data:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1 as values (0), (1), (2) as (c1);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t2 as values (1), (2), (3) as (c1);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t3 as values (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 5) as (a, b);\r\n```\r\nThe following query produces incorrect results:\r\n```\r\nselect t1.c1 as t1_c1, t2.c1 as t2_c1, b\r\nfrom t1\r\nfull outer join t2\r\nusing (c1),\r\nlateral (\r\n  select b\r\n  from t3\r\n  where a = coalesce(t2.c1, 1)\r\n) lt3;\r\n1\t1\t2\r\nNULL\t3\t4\r\nTime taken: 2.395 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\nspark-sql (default)> \r\n```\r\nThe result should be the following:\r\n```\r\n0\tNULL\t2\r\n1\t1\t2\r\nNULL\t3\t4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nScala client fails with NPE when running the following reduce agg:\r\n```\r\nspark.range(0, 5, 1, 10).as[Long].reduce(_ + _) == 10\r\n```\r\nThe reason is because the `range` will produce null partitions and the Reduce encoder will not be able to set the default value correctly for partitions that contains Scala primitives. In the example, we expect 0 but receive null. This causes the codegen wrongly assumes the input is nullable and generates wrong code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit and Scala Client E2E

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce AvroOption \"enableStableIdentifiersForUnionType\". If it is set to true (default remains to be false), Avro's union is converted to SQL schema by naming field name \"member_\" + type name. This is to try to keep field name stable with type name.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe purpose of this is twofold:\r\n\r\nTo allow adding or removing types to the union without affecting the record names of other member types. If the new or removed type is not ordered last, then existing queries referencing \"member2\" may need to be rewritten to reference \"member1\" or \"member3\".\r\nReferencing the type name in the query is more readable than referencing \"member0\".\r\nFor example, our system produces an avro schema from a Java type structure where subtyping maps to union types whose members are ordered lexicographically. Adding a subtype can therefore easily result in all references to \"member2\" needing to be updated to \"member3\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a unit test that covers all types supported in union, as well as some potential name conflict cases.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-22T17:53:22Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T20:32:09Z","closed_at":"2023-05-31T20:32:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4e1f76b3a083ebfccbc324c72f352bd409f7777","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41263/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41263/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41263/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3c10b0f685b67187b092235fabbc3de4c952372","head":{"label":"siying:avro_stable_union","ref":"avro_stable_union","sha":"d3c10b0f685b67187b092235fabbc3de4c952372","user":{"login":"siying","id":5334567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzQ1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5334567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying","html_url":"https://github.com/siying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":631023173,"node_id":"R_kgDOJZymRQ","name":"spark","full_name":"siying/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"siying","id":5334567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzQ1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5334567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying","html_url":"https://github.com/siying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/siying/spark","description":"Apache

The general idea is to split the default column value resolution into two parts:\r\n1. resolve the column \"DEFAULT\" to the column default expression. This applies to `Project`/`UnresolvedInlineTable` under `InsertIntoStatement`, and assignment expressions in `UpdateTable`/`MergeIntoTable`.\r\n2. fill missing columns with column default values for the input query. This does not apply to UPDATE and non-INSERT action of MERGE as they use the column from the target table as the default value.\r\n\r\nThe first part should be done for all the data sources, as it's part of column resolution. The second part should not be applied to v2 data sources with `ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA`, as they are free to define how to handle missing columns.\r\n\r\nMore concretely, this PR:\r\n1. put the column \"DEFAULT\" resolution logic in the rule `ResolveReferences`, with two new virtual rules. This is to follow https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38888\r\n2. put the missing column handling in `TableOutputResolver`, which is shared by both the v1 and v2 insertion resolution rule. External v2 data sources can add custom catalyst rules to deal with missing columns for themselves.\r\n3. Remove the old rule `ResolveDefaultColumns`. Note that, with the refactor, we no long need to manually look up the table. We will deal with column default values after the target table of INSERT/UPDATE/MERGE is resolved.\r\n4. Remove the rule `ResolveUserSpecifiedColumns` and merge it to `PreprocessTableInsertion`. These two rules are both to resolve v1 insertion, and it's tricky to reason about their interactions. It's clearer to resolve the insertion with one pass.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/58b6535cbf76f2b26fc08b94905a57dcc4d955f6 by merging `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe` and `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe_slow`, so that developers can locally use commands like `python/run-tests --testnames 'pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe DataFrameTests.test_validate_test_names` to test all the `DataFrame` APIs again.\r\n\r\nBut, I remove `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe` from the CI test lists, instead I would like to introduce another method to split the `test_dataframe` in CI:\r\n\r\n1. add a dictionary `python/pyspark/pandas/tests/test_dataframe_splits`;\r\n2. divide `test_dataframe` into splits like `split_a_b` which contains a subset of `test_dataframe` by name patterns, and add those splits into CI;\r\n3. add an extra test `test_validate_test_names` to make sure no test is missing.\r\n\r\nIn this way, if we need to split a large test file in the future, we can avoid large changes of moving code, instead we will only need to update those split files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\neven after https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/58b6535cbf76f2b26fc08b94905a57dcc4d955f6, `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe` and `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_dataframe_slow` are still too slow, each one normally takes >5 minutes, and sometimes >10 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. reuse SPARK_CONF_DIR config map for executor pods when the cm is already created for driver pod\r\n2. deprecated `spark.kubernetes.executor.disableConfigMap` as it may not be needed any more\r\n3. create config map for executor when running on k8s-client only\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. avoid unnecessary config map creation and reduce overhead to K8S\r\n2. code optimize to avoid unnecessary disk file scan to create spark conf config map\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.  `spark.kubernetes.executor.disableConfigMap` is deprecated and may not be necessary.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded
