Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently when source data has to read in row format and sanitization is enabled, we first read the data in avro format(which supports sanitization) and later convert from avro to row. This new approach simplifies this process by directly converting from json to row while applying sanitization.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen source data has to be read in row format, and sanitization is enabled. This change should make the conversion from json to row faster by directly converting from json to row.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Update HoodieSyncClient's to take in a meta client instance\r\n- Update sync tool helper to pass in meta client\r\n- Update StreamSync to pass in the meta client\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIn the StreamSync class, there is an option to sync to multiple meta sync classes. When doing so, each implementation of a HoodieSyncClient will load their own HoodieTableMetaClient leading to excess scans. \r\n\r\nThis change can also be useful for users calling the sync code from their own code.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two issues in the marker-based rollback strategy after the log file marker is introduced:\r\n- When MDT enabled, the rollback plan may include the non-existent log files based on the marker-based rollback strategy.  That leads to MDT file listing to contain the non-existent log files.  This PR fixes the MDT file listing to exclude non-existent log files.\r\n- If the log files written in the failed commit create new file groups, these log files are not deleted through the rollback.  This PR fixes the rollback plan based on the marker-based rollback strategy. \r\n\r\nNew tests are added to cover the cases that failed before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe bug discovered by this PR affects 0.15.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- When the `MercifulJsonConverter` is meant to write a value as a string, it writes out the value using the `ObjectMapper` if the input value is not a string. This allows us to simply pass through values without manipulating them.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- If a user has a string field that can be json, it would end up translating this field to a map and writing as the `Map`'s `toString` output instead of simply passing through the original value.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nTwo functions in `HoodieTableMetadataUtil`, `convertFilesToPartitionStatsRecords` and `convertMetadataToPartitionStatsRecords`, are being evaluated for unification. \r\nThese functions perform similar tasks of creating statistics for records in a partition. The proposal aims to combine them into a single function, improving code readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10352#discussion_r1584149612\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThis change will primarily affect the internal implementation of `HoodieTableMetadataUtil`. While it's not expected to impact the public API directly.\r\n\r\nThere are simillar other functions like mentioned below : \r\n- `convertFilesToColumnStatsRecords` and `convertMetadataToColumnStatsRecords`\r\n- `convertFilesToBloomFilterRecords` and `convertMetadataToBloomFilterRecords`\r\n\r\nUnification challenge:\r\nTo merge these function pairs, we would need to transform HoodieCommitMetadata into a format compatible with the unified function. This transformation process could potentially introduce inefficiencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAs this is an internal code refactoring, no user-facing documentation updates are required.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n\r\ncc - @codope

Currently, it seems there is no configuration to bypass this error, which prevents tables on file system such as OSS from using capabilities like calling clustering procedures.\r\n\r\nThe fix  is to skip adding this configuration when the file system does not support atomicity. This way, at least the basic functionality won't be blocked by this lock and can operate normally.\r\n\r\nThe error message is as follows:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\"

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR dehadoops hudi-client-common module by replacing `FileSystem` and related classes with `HoodieStorage` and other storage classes.\r\n\r\nMajor replacements:\r\n- FileSystem -> HoodieStorage\r\n        - fs -> storage,\r\n        - fs.mkdir -> storage.createDirectory\r\n        - fs.delete(<file>, false) -> storage.deleteFile\r\n        - fs.delete(<file>, true) -> storage.deleteDirectory\r\n        - fs.getFileStatus -> storage.getPathInfo\r\n        - fs.isDirectory -> storage.getPathInfo.isDirectory\r\n- Path -> StoragePath\r\n- FileStatus -> StoragePathInfo\r\n        - fileStatus.getLen() -> storagePathInfo.getLength()\r\n- FSDataOutputStream (created by fs.create()) -> OutputStream (created by storage.create())\r\n        - FSDataOutputStream.writeBytes() -> OutputStream.write(String.toBytes()) \r\nOthers:\r\n- Removed unused `SerializablePath` and `SerializablePathFilter`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-21T00:12:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T05:02:26Z","closed_at":"2024-09-09T02:58:16Z","merged_at":"2024-09-09T02:58:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"9bb8dcdf116f4d2b916aebe19adebb673131c43f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nValue of `hoodie.schema.on.read.enable` from externalized config `hudi-defaults.conf` was not taken into consideration while processing commands such as `alter table change column .. ` in Spark.   \r\nFixed it by utilzing `DFSPropertiesConfiguration.getGlobalProps` in `HoodieCatalog.loadTable` and `SparkXXResolveHudiAlterTableCommand.apply`.  \r\nRemoved code duplicates in `SparkXXResolveHudiAlterTableCommand` classes by moving common method `isSchemaEvolutionEnabled` to `ProvidesHoodieConfig`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSchema evolution option from hudi-defaults.conf works properly now with Spark SQL alter table change colunm.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nReplace Hadoop Configuration with StorageConfiguration in hudi-client-common module\r\n\r\nAdded new methods in `HadoopFSUtils` for classes in `hudi-client-common` to handle Hadoop related confs indirectly:\r\n- new `getStorageConf()` to create storage configuration with empty hadoop conf\r\n- new `getFs` to provide option to copy storage conf when getting `FileSystem`\r\n- `convertToHadoopConf` to convert storage conf to hadoop conf\r\n- `convertToJobConf` to convert storage conf to job conf\r\n- `setConfForConfigurableInputFormat` set hadoop conf for `FileInputFormat` that implement `Configurable`\r\n\r\nThis is a part of effort of removing Hadoop deps from `hudi-client-common`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-17T23:01:41Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T23:03:16Z","closed_at":"2024-08-20T21:10:43Z","merged_at":"2024-08-20T21:10:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f345342df965f97d5fc4f9d3fdc2cedbb1964f3","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdded a new lock provider which is exactly the same as existing zookeeper based one except the way the partition key part is handled. To be specific:\r\n- It requiresTable name as indicated by \"hoodie.table.name\".\r\n- It requiresTable base path \"hoodie.base.path\".\r\n- The zookeeper base path key ([hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.base_path](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#hoodiewritelockzookeeperbase_path)) is automatically derived as `/tmp/<table name>-<hash of the table base path>/`. To check the exact value, please check relevant log from class \r\norg.apache.hudi.client.transaction.lock.ZookeeperBasedImplicitBasePathLockProvider.\r\n- The zookeeper lock key config ([hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.lock_key](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#hoodiewritelockzookeeperlock_key)) uses a hard coded value \"lock_key\"\r\n- It will ignore value set by`\r\nhoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.base_path` and `hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.lock_key`.\r\n\r\nIt is also found that for zookeeper \"hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.url\" is not consumed by zookeeper lock provider class of hudi and the actual usage of those properties implies `hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.port` to have everything, which is in the form of `<IP1>:<Port1>,<IP2>:<Port2>,...`. For more details please refer https://app.clickup.com/t/18029943/ENG-13154.\r\n\r\nThe solution is we change the official doc to not mention the \"port\" config. Also update the \"url\" config explicitly with the formate mentioned above. This does not have any implications because if any existing user has successfully configured zookeeper, they must have already figured out the right format themselves, otherwise giving \"url\" with value that only contains <IP> will error out.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIntroduces new lock provider based on Zookeeper to make user experience better.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nno risk as of now since no one is using the new lock provider.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nIn https://hudi.apache.org/docs/concurrency_control/, we need to add description for the newly added lock provider.\r\n\r\nRemove `hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.port` as all it serves is confusing the doc reader that hudi populates it to the rest of the system.\r\n\r\nUpdate `hoodie.write.lock.zookeeper.url` description that the expected format is comma separated `<IP>:<URL>` strings like `<IP1>:<Port1>,<IP2>:<Port2>`\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-16T21:41:08Z","updated_at":"2024-09-16T23:18:21Z","closed_at":"2024-09-16T23:18:20Z","merged_at":"2024-09-16T23:18:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa922ed48fbfcaf66bee8dc16232d5097ebc1c5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf there is a skew in user defined columns for sortKey, spark sort reduces the number of tasks and this leads to an increase in contention when writing parquet files.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone, this handles skew for partitioners honouring user defined sort columns. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. The behaviour is behind this config and by default it's false.  \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static final ConfigProperty<Boolean> BULKINSERT_SUFFIX_RECORD_KEY_SORT_COLUMNS = ConfigProperty\r\n      .key(\"hoodie.bulkinsert.sort.suffix.record_key\")\r\n      .defaultValue(false)\r\n      .markAdvanced()\r\n      .withDocumentation(\r\n          \"When using user defined sort columns there can be possibility of skew because spark's RangePartitioner used in sort can reduce the number of outputSparkPartitions\"\r\n              + \"if the sampled dataset has a low cardinality on the provided sort columns.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRun IT's using the command line to do docker compose instead of the plugin. The plugin we were using https://github.com/Systemmanic/docker-compose-maven-plugin is pretty much just calling cli. So I tried to replicate the same command. The only thing that does not translate directly is the timeout. We will see if the exec timeout feature will deliver the same result.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGet CI to work again so we can land prs\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRun IT's using the command line to do docker compose instead of the plugin. The plugin we were using https://github.com/Systemmanic/docker-compose-maven-plugin is pretty much just calling cli. So I tried to replicate the same command. The only thing that does not translate directly is the timeout. We will see if the exec timeout feature will deliver the same result.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGet CI to work again so we can land prs\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdded support for Array of Rows and Maps with Row values in Flink. Only supports nesting 1 level deep. The Row cannot contain another Array or Map. \r\n\r\nI've only applied the changes to Flink `1.18.x`, but will copy to other versions if no changes are requested.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo change to the public API. As far as I could tell, the limitation of only allowing non container types was not in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow if there are adequate unit tests. I added unit tests for my two use cases, but I did not see a lot of unit tests. I'm not sure if there are unit tests that cover the Arrays and Maps of the basic types, which my changes could affect.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\nAs far as I could tell, this was not in the documentation. But it would be nice to note somewhere that as of this change, Arrays and Map values support basic types and Rows, but does not support additional Arrays or Maps within the Row.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith timestamp keygen you can have a partition column with timestamps, but then use the keygen so it will create partitions based on days so that all records that have a timestamp on 7-31-2024 will go to the same parititon even though the values in the partition column differ by hours and minutes etc.\r\n\r\nThis causes a problem with partition pruning. lets say you query \"select * from table where partition < 7-31-2024 at 7am and partition > 7-31-2024 at 6am \". Since the file structure has the partition of just 7-31-2024, that will be interpreted as 7-31-2024 at 12am. So the partition will be pruned from the search space.\r\n\r\nThis pr fixes the issue by rounding the query values based on the output format. The format of this is year month day, so it will round to the nearest day. The query for partition pruning will then be \"select * from table where partition < 7-31-2024 and partition > 7-31-2024 \". This will still not yield any results because it requires the partition to be less than and greater than the same day.\r\n\r\nTo fix that, we also replace any < or > with <= and >=. So now the query is \"select * from table where partition <= 7-31-2024 and partition => 7-31-2024 \". 7-31-2024 will now not be pruned, and the original filter will be applied by spark.\r\n\r\n(we can replace all < and > because we are only looking at partition filters in a simple timestamp keygen scenario.)\r\n\r\nThis does not fix cow or mor ro queries, because we treat those as just plain parquet tables and spark will handle the partition pruning.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nfix bug for some scenarios\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently the partition schema defined for table in SparkHoodieTableFileIndex does not handle the different partition types for the partition columns while reading the table. These partition types are simple and timestamp for custom based keygen. The Jira aims to handle these partition types while reading hudi tables and reproduce the issue as mentioned in mentioned in https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8343.\r\n\r\nChanges in the PR -\r\nHave a separate flag `useStringTypeForCustomTimestampPartition` in HoodieFileIndex which is used for HoodieBaseRelation and snapshot, incremental etc. queries. This flag would make sure that file index would use string type as the schema for timestamp partition columns.\r\nThe logical plan for insert into, merge into, update, DeleteFromTable and Create table commands have been changed now to mark the flag as false so that table schema does not change. If the flag is set to true while executing these commands, it can upgrade the schema for custom keygen timestamp partition columns to string type.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level

Change Logs\r\n\r\nhudi-flink UnitTest uses MockOperatorStateStore as the storage behind the state of KeyedStream. Because MockOperatorStateStore does not consider the key, stateful KeyedStream operators such as BucketAssignFunction are invalid for some tests because MockOperatorStateStore considers all input records to be duplicates, even if the key is different.\r\n\r\nWe added support for KeyedStream operators with MockKeyedStateStore.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low
