Description ##\r\nAs title.\r\n@ciyongch @pengzhao-intel @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nThis is a WIP pull request for implementing exports for some `ONNX` operators, which are needed to successfully export the `SSD` model from `gluocv`. The only 2 operators, which are not yet implemented are `_contrib_box_decode`, which can be sidestepped by using `SSD(minimal_opset=True)` and `_contrib_box_nms`, which could be potentially implemented with the `NonMaxSuppression` `ONNX` operator, but this is a big enough undertaking to be its own separate PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR assumes that #18054 is merged (ruro/onnx_version_bump), since it uses some `ONNX` operators only available in `v1.5.0`. (The first commit is a squashed version of that PR and will be dropped after it gets merged into master)\r\n\r\nIf you actually want to try exporting `SSD`, you should also merge #17827 (QueensGambit/onnx_export_slice_fix or ruro/onnx_export_slice_fix).\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n- `eagerly check onnx conversion availability in verbose mode`\r\n  The `export_model` method now warns about *all* nodes, that don't have a registered conversion **before** trying to export the model, if `verbose=True`. This is a simple quality of life change, which helps potential contributors to estimate, how many layers are missing until a model can be exported.\r\n- implement `_arange` op\r\n  (doesn't support the `repeat` attribute for now)\r\n- implement `ones_like` and `zeros_like` ops\r\n- implement `_lesser_scalar`, `_greater_scalar` and `_equal_scalar` ops\r\n  also fixes the issue, where the `scalar_op_helper` would fail, if the input is a non-1D initializer\r\n- implement `slice_like` op\r\n  (doesn't support the implicit `axes` variation right now)\r\n- implement `where`

Description ##\r\nThis PR was originally proposing to bump the ONNX version from `1.3.0` to `1.5.0`, but the ONNX version got bumped in #18025. However, in 18025 the tests weren't updated, so some of them are failing, so I am repurposing this PR, since it has the fixes necessary to update the tests.\r\n\r\nBelow is the original text of this PR (before 18025 bumped the ONNX version).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP pull request for increasing the supported `ONNX` version from `1.3.0` to `1.5.0`.\r\nThis change is motivated by the fact, that `ONNX v1.5.0` (opset 10) supports new operators, that should allow/simplify the implementation of some `mxnet -> ONNX` conversions, that are currently not implemented.\r\n\r\nList of potentially useful operators, which were not available in `1.3.0`, but are available in `1.5.0`:\r\n- `Compress`\r\n- `ConstantOfShape`\r\n- `EyeLike`\r\n- `NonMaxSuppression`\r\n- `NonZero`\r\n- `OneHot`\r\n- `Resize`\r\n- `RoiAlign`\r\n- `Scatter`\r\n- `Where`\r\n\r\nThere are more operators, but these are the important ones, IMO.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't implement any of the above operators, but just bumps the `ONNX` version in CI and fixes the tests for the newer version.\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n1) The `implement onnx translation helpers` commit just implements some helper functions, that I've used in all my PRs for ONNX translations\r\n2) Tests for trigonometric functions `sin`/`cos`, `acos`/`asin`/`atan` now have `[^h]` appended, so that it doesn't accidentally match with **new** ONNX test for the Hyperbolic trigonometric functions, the conversion for which is currently not implemented. (`test_sinh` etc)\r\n3) Test `test_matmul` changed to `test_matmul_`, so that it doesn't accidentally match with the **new** ONNX test for `matmulinteger`, the conversion for which is currently not implemented.\r\n4) Test `test_cast` changed to `test_cast((?!STRING).)*$`, so that it doesn't accidentally match with the **new** ONNX test for casting to/from strings. `((?!STRING).)*$` matches any text until the end of string, as long as it doesn't contain the word `STRING`.\r\n5) Updated the implementation for exporting `topk` and `slice_axis` operators, since they changed their API in the new opset version.\r\n6) Import tests for `test_slice` and `test_topk` were disabled, since the new versions of the operators moved some of the attributes to inputs (`k` for `TopK`, and `starts`, `ends`, `axes` and `steps` for `Slice`). Since mxnet (afaik) doesn't fully support dynamic shapes yet, importing the newer operators is currently not possible. Importing `TopK` and `Slice` operators, exported with the older onnx version and exporting to the newer opset still works, so this shouldn't be a breaking change.\r\n7) Added export tests for `slice_axis` and `topk`.\r\n8) Disabled the export tests for `ConvTranspose2d`. Actually, this test doesn't pass for me even with ONNX v1.3.0, so I am not sure, if it was broken all along or what's up with it. I think the current implementation doesn't implement the padding correctly, but I am not 100% sure.","created_at":"2020-04-14T16:05:47Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T20:18:31Z","closed_at":"2020-06-05T20:18:17Z","merged_at":"2020-06-05T20:18:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"deae9b88c1724e056a4e7dc21f04b58c28304111","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9135ae7c059e56e416e6c13943bb7c9d80d4144e","head":{"label":"ruro:onnx_version_bump","ref":"onnx_version_bump","sha":"9135ae7c059e56e416e6c13943bb7c9d80d4144e","user":{"login":"ruro","id":3747318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDczMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3747318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro","html_url":"https://github.com/ruro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c59a3255346ebe9bc0729c5a702fc99624ed2374","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-13T14:12:36Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T04:58:12Z","closed_at":"2020-04-14T04:58:12Z","merged_at":"2020-04-14T04:58:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a044744884271f82465dfd2ddd04fe37870da51c","assignee":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d8c16ed1c7da0368a5cbf96bdfb123353216affb","head":{"label":"DwwWxx:FFI_for_linalg_lstsq_linalg_qr","ref":"FFI_for_linalg_lstsq_linalg_qr","sha":"d8c16ed1c7da0368a5cbf96bdfb123353216affb","user":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224129560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjk1NjA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gr

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17707 from master to v1.x branch, and will be included in v1.7 release.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nwork done mostly by @ChaokunChang . This PR enabled switching to byteps using `Trainer(kvstore='byteps')`\r\nTODO: enable test with multiple GPUs when multi-GPU CI machines are in place. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-11T23:23:59Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T20:05:13Z","closed_at":"2020-06-04T21:20:53Z","merged_at":"2020-06-04T21:20:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"e28e9fec9bba07708ed0093c882b8070a96dfdd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/24b71c0145cb7c8aa851d88c0a92c35804be57f7","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:bps-fix-rebase","ref":"bps-fix-rebase","sha":"24b71c0145cb7c8aa851d88c0a92c35804be57f7","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserco

Description ##\r\n**Mirror PR of #18001, towards v1.6.x branch**. In this PR, we add support of quantization flow of the rnn operator. Currently, only the LSTM mode supports INT8 inference.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add _contrib_quantized_rnn op.\r\n- [x] Add asymmetric quantization - _contrib_quantized_asym op, to quantize FP32 data to U8 data using scale and shift.\r\n- [x] Add MXNET_USE_WEIGHT_CACHE to control rnn init behavior.\r\n- [x] Support data layout in NDArrayIter. Specifically, NDArrayIter supports only `NCHW` layout by default, and there is no way to support other layouts, like sequential `TNC` layout. This PR makes some changes to NDArrayIter to leverage the feature (assuming that N represents the batch).\r\n- [x] Move MKLDNNRnnMemMgr to individual layer.\r\n\r\n##Comments##\r\n* Performance results will be added to #18001.\r\n\r\n@ciyongch @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nI noticed that recently my nightly build pipeline for v1.x (drawing on the v1.x branch from the main repository as its source) began to fail. I hadn't changed any code, but I noticed that the error being generated stemmed from an RVM version issue that I fixed in master by pinning the dependency version as part of my [General Version Dropdown PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17948). Since v1.x doesn't include changes to master, I realized that I would need to incorporate this fix in v1.x as well in order to get my nightly builds (or any website builds on this branch) to pass.\r\n\r\nI tested my fix for this branch via my [v1.x nightly build Jenkins pipeline](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-nightly-website-build-1.x/), and it passed with my

Description ##\r\nIn this PR, we add support of quantization flow of the rnn operator. Currently, only the LSTM mode supports INT8 inference.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add _contrib_quantized_rnn op.\r\n- [x] Add asymmetric quantization - _contrib_quantized_asym op, to quantize FP32 data to U8 data using scale and shift.\r\n- [x] Add MXNET_USE_WEIGHT_CACHE to control rnn init behavior.\r\n- [x] Support data layout in NDArrayIter. Specifically, NDArrayIter supports only `NCHW` layout by default, and there is no way to support other layouts, like sequential `TNC` layout. This PR makes some changes to NDArrayIter to leverage the feature (assuming that N represents the batch).\r\n- [x] Move MKLDNNRnnMemMgr to individual layer.\r\n\r\n@ciyongch @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel

\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17555\r\n\r\n@ChaokunChang \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-08T17:25:09Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T20:04:48Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T22:57:29Z","merged_at":"2020-04-08T22:57:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"6cc990c6a04ee4a51e188849fa4492ce21778b52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/cb932cd59bd8078876af66cfe4f8a348441e38cc","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:revert","ref":"revert","sha":"cb932cd59bd8078876af66cfe4f8a348441e38cc","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nAs per https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17968, require C++17 compatible compiler. \r\nFor cuda code, use C++14 mode introduced in Cuda 9. In general there is no issue with linking together objects resulting from different standards as long as they are compiled by the same compiler. \r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following specific changes:\r\n- Switch CI pipeline to use gcc7 on Ubuntu and CentOS \r\n- Switch CD pipeline to CentOS 7 with https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-7/ This enables us to build with gcc7 C++17 compiler while keeping a relatively old glibc requirement for distribution.\r\n- Simplify ARM Edge builds\r\n  - Switch to standard Ubuntu / Debian cross-compilation toolchain for ARMv7, ARMv8\r\n  - Switch to https://toolchains.bootlin.com/ toolchain for ARMv6 (the Debian ARMv6 toolchain is for ARMv4 + ARMv5 + ARMv6, but we wish to only target ARMv6 and make use of ARMv6 features)\r\n  - Remove reliance on `dockcross` for cross compilation.\r\n- Simplify Jetson build\r\n  - Use standard Ubuntu / Debian cross-compilation toolchain for ARMv8\r\n  - Upgrade to Cuda 10 and Jetpack 4.3\r\n  - Simplify build setup\r\n- Simplify QEMU ARM virtualization test setup on CI\r\n  - Remove complex \"Virtual Machine in Docker\" logic and run a QEMU based Docker container instead based on `arm32v7/ubuntu`\r\n- Fix out of bounds vector accesses in\r\n  - SoftmaxGradOpType\r\n  - MKLDNNFCBackward\r\n- Fix use of non-standard `rand_r` function (which is not available on anymore on newer Android toolchains and shouldn't be use in any case).\r\n- Fix reproducibility of RNN with Dropout\r\n- Fix reproducibility of DGL Graph Sampling Operators\r\n- Update tests for Android Edge build to NDK19. The [previously used standalone toolchain is obsolete](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain).\r\n\r\nThose Dockerfiles that required refactoring as part of the effort were refactored based on the following consideration\r\n- Maximize the use of system dependencies provided by the distribution instead of manually installing dependencies from source or from third party vendors. This reduces the complexity of the installation process and essentially pins the dependency versions, increasing CI stability. Further, Dockerfile build speed is improved. To facilitate this, use recent distribution versions. We still ensure backwards compatibility via CentOS7 based build and test stages\r\n- Minimize the number of layers in the Dockerfile. Don't have 5 different script files executed, each calling `apt-get update` and `install`, but just execute once. Speeds up the build and reduces image size. Keep each Dockerfile simple and tailored to a purpose, instead of running 20 scripts to install dependencies for every thinkable scenario, which is unmaintainable.\r\n \r\nSome more small changes:\r\n- Remove outdated references to Cuda 7 and Cuda 8 in various files.\r\n- Remove C++03 support in mshadow\r\n- Disable broken tests (may fix as part of this PR if I find the time)\r\n  -

Description ##\r\nHi, there.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the implementation in `mshadow_op.h`, namely the `sum` reducer will return a wrong result when the input contains `np.inf`.\r\nThe bug in `mshadow/base.h` has been fixed in [PR#16234](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16234) , but it still exists in `mshadow_op.h`.\r\n\r\n`mx.np.sum` and `mx.np.mean` will launch the `sum` reducer in `mshadow_op.h`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I fix the bug in `mshadow_op.h`.\r\n\r\n## Reproduce ##\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet import np, npx\r\nnpx.set_np()\r\n\r\na = mx.nd.array([np.inf,2,3])\r\nprint(a.mean())\r\n\r\na = np.array([np.inf,2,3])\r\nprint(a.mean())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second output is wrong.\r\n```bash\r\n[inf]\r\n<NDArray 1 @cpu(0)>\r\n\r\nnan\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe correct result should be:\r\n```bash\r\n[inf]\r\n<NDArray 1 @cpu(0)>\r\n\r\ninf\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nReduce some overhead when the req[0] is kWriteTo or kWriteInplace.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nWhen doing `autograd.backward` on a `HybridBlock` with constant parameters, arrays for gradient outputs for those parameters are not provided by the frontend (since they are not needed) and instead they are temporarily allocated each time backward is executed. \r\nHowever, `CachedOp` hybridized with `static_shape=True` checks for all input/output arrays to match the saved ones. The fact that the output for those not-real gradients is temporarily generated each time might result in a mismatch and regeneration of engine ops during each iteration, which introduces big gaps in the execution.\r\nSince the `arrays` in the CachedOp are saved in the state, it is actually OK to reuse the already saved `NDArray` even if there is a mismatch, as long as the `kNullOp` req is set, which this PR does.\r\n\r\n@zheng-da @eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I

Description ##\r\nMinimal version of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17808 \r\n\r\nUpdate Windows CI to use VS 2019 and enable x64 bit toolchain. Previously we are using an older 32 bit toolchain causing OOM errors during linking.  Switching to x64 bit toolchain on the older VS version previously used by the CI was attempted in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17912 and did not work. Update to Cuda 10.2 as it is required by VS 2019. Switch to ninja-build on Windows to speed up build as ninja-build is now preinstalled. Remove logic to install cmake 3.16 on every PR as cmake 3.17 is now preinstalled.\r\n\r\nCC: @marcoabreu

Description ##\r\nThis PR aims to support projection feature for LSTM towards the CPU platform.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Upgrade dnnl(mkldnn) to its v1.4 version\r\n- [x] Change some statement of `mkldnn` to `dnnl`\r\n- [x] Implement LSTMP from both native and DNNL pass\r\n- [x] Add unit test for LSTMP\r\n- [x] Add env var to control the initializing behavior of RNN\r\n- [x] Remain input dim as int type in dnnl pass\r\n- [x] Add logging message for MXNET_RNN_USE_WEIGHT_CACHE=1\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This feature requires dnnl-v1.4rc porting to MXNet v1.6.x branch.

Description ##\r\nAdded 1bit gradient compression implementation which has similar speedup with 2bit compression. It works with a threshold, values in gradient above the threshold will be quantized to +1, while values below the threshold will be quantizaed to -1. Different with 2bit compression, this implementation of 1bit supports zero threshold. In addition, 1bit compression seems perform better than the current implentation of 2bit compression when batch size increase.\r\n\r\n### Important files to review ###\r\ngradient_compression-inl.h\r\ngradient_compression.cc\r\n\r\n### Test accuracy of ResNet110 on cifar10 with 1/2/4 workers ###\r\neach worker is equipped with 4 Tesla V100 GPUs\r\ntraining command: \r\n```python\r\npython /mxnet/tools/launch.py --launcher ssh -H hosts -n 4 python train_cifar10.py \\\r\n--num-epochs 200 --mode hybrid --num-gpus 4 -j 8 --batch-size 128 --wd 0.0001 \\\r\n--lr 0.1 --lr-decay 0.1 --lr-decay-epoch 100,150 --model cifar_resnet20_v1 \\\r\n--kv-store dist_sync_device --gc-type 1bit --gc-threshold 0 \r\n```\r\n#### 1worker\r\n![resnet20_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24750212/109163918-cfdb3380-77b4-11eb-9d38-5951e5fa1be0.png)\r\n\r\n#### 2workers\r\n![resnet20_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24750212/109163973-de294f80-77b4-11eb-951a-ffaf1347551e.png)\r\n\r\n#### 4workers\r\n![resnet20_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24750212/109164027-e97c7b00-77b4-11eb-8f7e-dcaf5985e525.png)\r\n\r\n#### 4workers, update_on_kvstore=false\r\n![resnet20_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24750212/109164070-f7320080-77b4-11eb-9d52-5f8efc2b539c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Result of 2-layer LSTM trained on PTB with 1 worker ###\r\n#### train perplexity\r\n![lstm_train](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24750212/109163843-bb973680-77b4-11eb-80e0-fb2cd20f0c1d.png)\r\n\r\n#### test perplexity\r\n![lstm_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24750212/109163877-c5209e80-77b4-11eb-8aa6-8306631d6579.png)\r\n\r\n### Throughput \r\nIn this part, we use example/imageclassification/benchmark.py to evaluate the performance of gradient compression. We have tried our best to optimize the kernel function of gradient compression operations. In the original kernel function, each thread manipulates 32 bits (4 bytes) of compressed gradients, whereas in our kernel function, each thread writes 8 bits (1 byte) at once. The difference between the original and our implementations are follows.\r\n\r\noriginal kernel implementation:\r\n```c++\r\nstruct quantize_2bit {\r\n  MSHADOW_XINLINE static void Map(int out_block_id,\r\n                                  int original_size,\r\n                                  float *out,\r\n                                  float *grad,\r\n                                  float *residual,\r\n                                  const float neg_threshold,\r\n                                  const float pos_threshold) {\r\n    // this block contains the compressed representation of\r\n    // upto 16 values starting from out_block_id*16\r\n    float *compr_block = out + out_block_id;\r\n    // init to 0\r\n    *compr_block = 0;\r\n    // start and end are indices in original grad array\r\n    const int start = out_block_id << 4;\r\n    const int end = (start + 16 <= original_size) ? start + 16 : original_size;\r\n    // cast as char* to manipulate bits of float addresses\r\n    char *block_ptr = reinterpret_cast < char * > (compr_block);\r\n    // masks to set bits when value meets pos_threshold\r\n    // 0xc0 is mask when value is to be represented by the first two bits in a char*\r\n    // 0xc0 means first two bits are set to 11\r\n    const uint8_t posbits[] = {0xc0, 0x30, 0x0c, 0x03};\r\n    // masks to set bits when value meets neg_threshold\r\n    const uint8_t negbits[] = {0x80, 0x20, 0x08, 0x02};\r\n    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {\r\n      // adds offset to reach appropriate byte\r\n      char *curr_byte = block_ptr + ((i - start) >> 2);\r\n      // adds gradient to existing residual to get updated grad\r\n      residual[i] += grad[i];\r\n      if (residual[i] >= pos_threshold) {\r\n        // set data to 11\r\n        *curr_byte |= posbits[(i & 3)];\r\n        // reduce residual by pos_threshold\r\n        residual[i] -= pos_threshold;\r\n      } else if (residual[i] <= neg_threshold) {\r\n        // set data to 10\r\n        *curr_byte |= negbits[(i & 3)];\r\n        residual[i] -= neg_threshold;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nour kernel implementation:\r\n```c++\r\nstruct quantize_2bit {\r\n  MSHADOW_XINLINE static void Map(int out_byte_id,\r\n                                  int original_size,\r\n                                  float *out,\r\n                                  float *grad,\r\n                                  float *residual,\r\n                                  const float neg_threshold,\r\n                                  const float pos_threshold) {\r\n    // this block contains the compressed representation of\r\n    // upto 4 values starting from (char*)out + out_byte_id\r\n    char *compr_byte = reinterpret_cast<char *>(out) + out_byte_id;\r\n    // init to 0\r\n    *compr_byte = 0;\r\n    // start and end are indices in original grad array\r\n    const int start = out_byte_id << 2;\r\n    const int end = (start + 4 <= original_size) ? start + 4 : original_size;\r\n\r\n    // masks to set bits when value meets pos_threshold\r\n    // 0xc0 is mask when value is to be represented by the first two bits in a char*\r\n    // 0xc0 means first two bits are set to 11\r\n    const uint8_t posbits[] = {0xc0, 0x30, 0x0c, 0x03};\r\n    // masks to set bits when value meets neg_threshold\r\n    const uint8_t negbits[] = {0x80, 0x20, 0x08, 0x02};\r\n    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {\r\n      // adds gradient to existing residual to get updated grad\r\n      residual[i] += grad[i];\r\n      if (residual[i] >= pos_threshold) {\r\n        // set data to 11\r\n        *compr_byte |= posbits[(i & 3)];\r\n        // reduce residual by pos_threshold\r\n        residual[i] -= pos_threshold;\r\n      } else if (residual[i] <= neg_threshold) {\r\n        // set data to 10\r\n        *compr_byte |= negbits[(i & 3)];\r\n        residual[i] -= neg_threshold;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nOur optimized implementation performs well when use multiple GPUs on a single machine. Here is a benchmark test of the VGG16 model on a 4 GPUs machine (unit: samples/sec).\r\n| VGG16 | original | our  |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| onebit  | ~626  | ~752  |\r\n| twobit | ~705  | ~761  |\r\n| baseline | ~564 ||\r\n\r\n**However, our implementation works not well when the compression operator is lunched on the CPU, especially when we use multiple nodes and set `kvstore=dist_sync`.** Under such circumstance, our new implementation may lead to a little throughput reduction. IMHO, one possible solution is adopting different kernel functions for CPU and GPU respectively. In other words, we can use the original kernel for CPU compression operation while the new kernel for GPU operation (still working in process...).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are benchmark tests of

Description ##\r\nAdd op linalg.lstsq\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-01T05:16:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T00:00:24Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T00:00:24Z","merged_at":"2020-04-08T00:00:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"892f9823e1d391413d96e80e0e6cc54f8bb82728","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1ea2c5f251407c347b000cbf4a787d6737a4b50a","head":{"label":"DwwWxx:linalg_lstsq","ref":"linalg_lstsq","sha":"1ea2c5f251407c347b000cbf4a787d6737a4b50a","user":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224129560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjk1NjA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravat

\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nThis PR resolves the issues outlined in the Github issue for the [MXNet Website 2.0 General Version Dropdown](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17798). It serves to add a fully functional API version dropdown with consistent styling to the master website, and also modifies the Jenkins build instructions to download static artifacts from an [external repository](https://github.com/connorgoggins/mxnet-website-artifacts). Currently, this repository of static artifacts includes websites for the following past versions of the MXNet API:\r\n- 1.6\r\n- 1.5.0\r\n- 1.4.1\r\n- 1.3.1\r\n- 1.2.1\r\n- 1.1.0\r\n- 1.0.0\r\n- 0.11.0\r\n- 0.12.1\r\n\r\nEach version of the website also has a similarly formatted API version dropdown in the header of each page, making it easy for users to seamlessly navigate between different versions of the MXNet website.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- M

Description ##\r\nThis PR changes the API of the Gluon's `register_op_hook` method to take the Python strings and MXNet NDArray instead of the C string and internal NDArrayHandle. Also it fixes a bug in the documentation (which previously said that the function should take 2 parameters, whereas in fact it takes 3).\r\n\r\nThis change makes the `register_op_hook` much more user-friendly, especially for people not familiar with MXNet internals.\r\n\r\n@szha @eric-haibin-lin @anirudh2290 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nThe function of `AddTakeGrad` is used in the backward pass of embedding operator. Originally it uses tensor-level summation, which is very slow. By replacing tensor-level summation to element-wise summation, this function can be faster (about 6X speedup for a dummy example).\r\n\r\n@xinyu-intel @zixuanweeei @TaoLv please review.\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nSupport using `any` format in pooling backward. For performance reasons, backward computations of pooling requires consistent memory format with the corresponding forward computations. Hence, using `any` format means it will align with forward memory format automatically, this avoids unnecessary reorder.\r\n\r\n@TaoLv @rongzha1 @PatricZhao please review.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-24T06:31:49Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T00:02:27Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T00:02:27Z","merged_at":"2020-04-08T00:02:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f906a02b7783f7bbb38015ad2a6632adc1e714df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ae02968ede29abfb85d759489a8d208f3acb9d22","head":{"label":"Tommliu:ffi_atleast","ref":"ffi_atleast","sha":"ae02968ede29abfb85d759489a8d208f3acb9d22","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nEnhancements to MXNet Extensions (subgraph property, custom ops, custom graph passes). Addresses a few points from #17236. More description on the way!\r\n\r\n### Features ###\r\n- Enhancement to supportedOps to allow for graph coloring (specifying which subgraph an op should be partitioned into)\r\n- Enhancement for partitioners to use Selector class instead of supportedOps\r\n- Added a new example for custom subgraph op using selector class\r\n- Clean up lib_api.h and library loading in c_api.cc\r\n- Added option to quiet library loading printing ops, partitioners, passes found in library\r\n- Add support for custom graph passes, and docs/README\r\n- Add a new example for custom pass libraries with 2 example passes \r\n- Added support for allocating new args/aux within the pass, or replacing existing args/aux\r\n- Add new custom pass lib to Makefile/CMakeLists.txt\r\n- Add building sparse custom op libraries to Makefile/CMakeLists.txt\r\n- Add compiling custom libs with lowest supported C++11, building with C++17 for testing with MXNet\r\n- \r\n\r\n#### SupportedOps Enhancements for graph coloring\r\n\r\nIn the custom partitioner API, custom library writers could implement the `SupportedOps` API to specify which ops to include in a subgraph by setting `True/False` for each node ID in the graph. This PR adds support for writers to identify which specific subgraph to include a node into by specifying a subgraph ID integer for each node, or -1 to indicate that a node can go into any subgraph. \r\n\r\n#### Selector class for subgraph creation\r\n\r\nIn the custom partitioner API, custom library writers could implement the `SupportedOps` API to specify which ops to include in a subgraph. But some custom partitioners may want more control. This PR, adds support for the internal MXNet subgraph property `SubgraphSelector` class to be implemented in a custom library. Custom library writers can choose to implement `SupportedOps` API or `CustomOpSelector` class for their partitioner. \r\n\r\n#### Custom Graph Passes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to register a custom graph pass in a library. Working backwards from the custom library writer, the `Pass` API is implemented with the following interface:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMXReturnValue myPass(const std::string& in_graph, const std::string** out_graph,\r\n                     const std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& options,\r\n                     const std::unordered_map<std::string, MXTensor>& args,\r\n                     const std::unordered_map<std::string, MXTensor>& aux,\r\n                     const PassResource& res)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe model graph is passed as a JSON string, and users provide a new JSON string for the modified graph. Options specified by the MXNet user at the Python level are passed in the `options` map. If the MXNet user provided the args/aux at the Python level they are provided to the pass in the `args/aux` arguments. The PassResource class `res` exposes two functions: `alloc_arg` and `alloc_aux` that allow the custom library writer to allocate NDArrays for new or replacement args/aux within the custom pass. Custom passes are registered in the library with this syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nREGISTER_PASS(myPassName)\r\n.setBody(myPassFunc);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs custom passes are found in the library during loading, a lambda function is registered:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto pass_lambda = [=] (nnvm::Graph&& g) {\r\n    ...\r\n    CHECK(callGraphPass(...));\r\n    ...\r\n    return out_graph;\r\n};\r\n\r\nnnvm::PassFunctionReg& pass = dmlc::Registry<nnvm::PassFunctionReg>::Get()->__REGISTER__(myPassName);\r\npass.set_body(pass_lambda);\r\npass.set_change_graph(true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the MXNet front-end, users call custom passes using the same `optimize_for` API. The backend name argument to the `optimize_for` API is attempted to be looked up in registered subgraph backends first, and if missing is attempted to be looked up in registered graph passes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (mxnet::op::SubgraphBackendRegistry::Get()->backend_map_.count(backend_name) > 0) {\r\n    // use subgraph backend\r\n    ...\r\n} else if (dmlc::Registry<nnvm::PassFunctionReg>::Find(backend_name) != nullptr) {\r\n    // use graph pass\r\n    ...\r\n    g = ApplyPass(std::move(g), backend_name);\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Compilation\r\nThe lib_api.h was designed to be as generic as possible to allow users to compile their custom library with any version of C++ (C++11 or higher) and GLIBC to fit the needs of their application. This does not have to correspond to the version of C++ or GLIBC used to compile MXNet. To test this, we will compile with C++11 to check for compiler errors, but will also compile and test with C++17 to match was MXNet is using. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\nImproves the performance of broadcast axis by reducing ALU operations and caching stride values. This operator is crucial in performance of SSD which gets slowed down by over 50%(total training time) when MXNet is built with Large Tensor Support enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR leverages vectorization or SIMD architecture of the CPU. It is described as follows:\r\n\r\n### Vectorization ### \r\nis the term for converting a scalar program to a vector program. Vectorized programs can run multiple operations from a single instruction(SIMD), whereas scalar can only operate on pairs of operands at once.\r\n\r\nConsider the following very simple loop that adds the elements of two arrays and stores the results to a third array.\r\n```\r\nfor (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\r\n    C[i] = A[i] + B[i];\r\n```\r\nVectorizing it, produces something like this:\r\n```\r\nfor (int i=0; i<16; i+=4)\r\n    C[i:i+3] = A[i:i+3] + B[i:i+3];\r\n```\r\nNote: The key here is that the elements need to be adjacent (so they can be loaded into vector registors. Note:avx 512 ISA does have \"gatherd\" intstruction for gathering sparse data from scattred locations into avx512 register but that operation is still slow compared to adjacent data being loaded into the register) and there should not be any fundamental dependency(or read after write dependency) in subsequent iterations of the loop. For e.g. the following loop cannot be vectorized because C[i+1] depends on the value of C[i] which needs to bew calculated first.\r\n```\r\nfor (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\r\n    C[i] = A[i] + C[i-1];\r\n```\r\nbecause if we unroll the loop and substitute values:\r\n```\r\nfor (int i=0; i<16; i+=4) {\r\n    C[i]   = A[i]   + C[i-1];\r\n     |\r\n     |-------------------------|\r\n                               |\r\n    C[i+1] = A[i+1] + C[i]; <--|\r\n     |\r\n     |---------------------------|\r\n                                 |\r\n    C[i+2] = A[i+2] + C[i+1]; <--|\r\n     |\r\n     |---------------------------|\r\n                                 |\r\n    C[i+3] = A[i+3] + C[i+2]; <--|\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe arrows above show read after write dependency.the above statements cannot be executed in parallel by loading A[1:4] and C[1:4] into vector registers(here 1:4 is just for illustration purposes depending on the word size and register size it can load more data elements).\r\n\r\nHow is it different from loop unrolling? Unrolling transforms the loop into something that looks like this:\r\n```\r\nfor (int i=0; i<16; i+=4) {\r\n    C[i]   = A[i]   + B[i];\r\n    C[i+1] = A[i+1] + B[i+1];\r\n    C[i+2] = A[i+2] + B[i+2];\r\n    C[i+3] = A[i+3] + B[i+3];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Side Effects ###\r\nfor cases where 1 or very few elements need to be broadcasted to very large no. of locations the performance is not optimized. There is a slowdown when compared to master(int32 w/o large tensor support)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All
