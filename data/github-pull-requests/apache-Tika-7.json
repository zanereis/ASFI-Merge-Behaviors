some package-private methods whose signature includes the Java 8 <code>Collector</code> API. This is a test to identify any problems before we expose those methods publicly to users. Please report any problems that you encounter. (73dbf7ef26)</li>\n<li>Changed various classes to catch <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>RuntimeException</code> even when only <code>RuntimeException</code> is theoretically possible. This can help code that throws undeclared exceptions, as some bytecode rewriters (e.g., Robolectric) and languages (e.g., Kotlin) do. (c294c23760, 747924e, b2baf48)</li>\n<li>Added an <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> to <code>failureaccess</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">Guava's one strong runtime dependency</a>. (280b5d2f60)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: In <code>guava-android</code> only, removed <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. These methods never worked in an Android VM, and to reflect that, they were born <code>@Deprecated</code>, <code>@Beta</code>, and <code>@DoNotCall</code>. They're now preventing us from rolling out some new Android compatibility testing. This is <strong>the only binary-incompatible change in this release</strong>, and it should have no effect in practice. Still, we bump the major version number to follow Semantic Versioning. (045cd8428f)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed our implementations to avoid eagerly initializing loggers during class loading. This can help performance, especially under Android.

Overview:\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThis PR fixes the flaky/non-deterministic behavior of the following test because it assumes the ordering.\r\n\r\n[org.apache.tika.cli.TikaCLITest#testJsonMetadataOutput](https://github.com/apache/tika/blob/7b79f881e7b47f9272d626ebdfb9456fc206e08f/tika-app/src/test/java/org/apache/tika/cli/TikaCLITest.java#L248)\r\n\r\nTest Overview:\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThe output returned by getParamOutContent is flaky in nature and is non-deterministic. This results in the testJsonMetadataOutput failing.\r\n\r\nThis flakiness was identified by the [nondex tool](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) created by the researchers of UIUC.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR]   TikaCLITest.testJsonMetadataOutput:258 expected: <true> but was: <false>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the issue by running the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn install -pl tika-app -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn test -pl tika-app  -Dtest=org.apache.tika.cli.TikaCLITest#testJsonMetadataOutput\r\nmvn -pl tika-app edu.illinois:index-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.tika.cli.TikaCLITest#testJsonMetadataOutput\r\n```\r\nFix:\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nTo fix the issue I decided to sort the JSON string. To sort the JSON string I used the Google extension \"com.google.code.gson\" in the tika-app/pom.xml file. This made the output deterministic and led the code to successfully passing.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/njain2208/tika/blob/8fce6e9afcc6872e0d5cdfac08ccd2c7dfd7d0b0/tika-app/src/test/java/org/apache/tika/cli/TikaCLITest.java#L251-L271","created_at":"2023-11-30T07:53:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T16:20:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/1476/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/1476/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/1476/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/8fce6e9afcc6872e0d5cdfac08ccd2c7dfd7d0b0","head":{"label":"njain2208:njain2208-flaky-fix-1","ref":"njain2208-flaky-fix-1","sha":"8fce6e9afcc6872e0d5cdfac08ccd2c7dfd7d0b0","user":{"login":"njain2208","id":54635559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjM1NTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54635559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208","html_url":"https://github.com/njain2208","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":725454218,"node_id":"R_kgDOKz2Nig","name":"tika","full_name":"njain2208/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"njain2208","id":54635559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjM1NTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54635559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208","html_url":"https://github.com/njain2208","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njain2208/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/njain2208/tika","description":"The

These methods update the original DOM, as well as the Elements list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2017\">jhy/jsoup#2017</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the NodeIterator class, to efficiently traverse a node tree using the Iterator interface. And\nadded Stream Element#stream() and Node#nodeStream() methods, to enable fluent composable stream pipelines of node\ntraversals.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2051\">jhy/jsoup#2051</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when changing the OutputSettings syntax to XML, the xhtml EscapeMode is automatically set by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the <code>:is(selector list)</code> pseudo-selector, which finds elements that match any of the selectors in\nthe selector list. Useful for making large ORed selectors more readable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: repackaged the library with native (vs automatic) JPMS module support.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2025\">jhy/jsoup#2025</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: better fidelity of source positions when tracking is enabled. And implicitly created or closed elements\nare tracked and detectable via Range.isImplicit().\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2056\">jhy/jsoup#2056</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when source tracking is enabled, the source position for attribute names and values is now available.\nAttribute#sourceRange() provides the ranges.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2057\">jhy/jsoup#2057</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when running concurrently under Java 21+ Virtual Threads, virtual threads could be pinned to their\ncarrier platform thread when parsing an input stream. To improve performance, particularly when parsing fetched\nURLs, the internal ConstrainableInputStream has been replaced by ControllableInputStream, which avoids the locking\nwhich caused that pinning.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2054\">jhy/jsoup#2054</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.Connect, allow any XML mimetype as a supported mimetype. Was previously limited to\n<code>{application|text}/xml</code>. This enables for e.g. fetching SVGs with a image/svg+xml mimetype, without having to\ndisable mimetype validation.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2059\">jhy/jsoup#2059</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when outputting with XML syntax, HTML elements that were parsed as data nodes (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) should\nbe emitted as CDATA nodes, so that they can be parsed correctly by an XML parser.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1720\">jhy/jsoup#1720</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the Immediate Parent selector <code>&gt;</code> could match elements above the root context element, causing incorrect\nelements to be returned when used on elements other than the root document.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/releases\">io.projectreactor:reactor-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v3.6.0</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Reactor-Core 3.6.0 is part of 2023.0.0 Release Train.</p>\n<p>This is the first GA release of 2023.0.0 🎉</p>\n<p>This note focuses on 3.6.0 proper, curating changes from across all milestones and also includes changes already released as part of 3.4.x line up to 3.4.34 as well as 3.5.x line up to 3.5.12.</p>\n<p>While there are plenty of improvements and bug fixes, it's worth to highlight the bigger themes first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Schedulers.boundedElastic()</code> may return a specific implementation tailored for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/\">Project Loom</a> and running on virtual threads if application runs in Java 21+ runtime and have set the <code>reactor.schedulers.defaultBoundedElasticOnVirtualThreads</code> system property to <code>true</code>. Please consult the <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html#boundedElastic--\">javadocs</a> and <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/reference/#schedulers\">the reference documentation</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/238\">Multi-Release Jar</a>. Since this release project has java version specific sources that are enabled if runs in specific Java runtime. This allows to avoid unnecessary reflection checks as well as embrace some new neat java features without changing the baseline for the whole code base.</li>\n<li>Hardening of the context-propagation. This release introduces better support for external <code>Publisher</code>s detection with their corresponding decoration if detected. This enables more stable context-propagation when it comes to external libraries integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See dedicated pre-release <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2023/10/31/what-new-is-coming-in-reactor-core-3-6-0#virtual-threads-support\">blogpost</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<h3>:warning: Update

Description\r\n\r\n- Type of change :\r\n  - [ ] New feature\r\n  - [ ] Bug fix for existing feature\r\n  - [ ] Code quality improvement\r\n  - [X] Addition or Improvement of tests\r\n  - [ ] Addition or Improvement of documentation\r\n\r\nFix a flaky test, caused by nondeterministic iteration order of HashMap\r\n\r\n### Related Test\r\n[org.apache.tika.parser.microsoft.ooxml.xps.XPSParserTest.testVarious](https://github.com/lxb007981/tika/blob/971f0cbd9b46c1d7fb96b0a3732c3fc870920aba/tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-microsoft-module/src/test/java/org/apache/tika/parser/microsoft/ooxml/xps/XPSParserTest.java#L59)\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\nhttps://github.com/lxb007981/tika/blob/d466492e0a01c8ee28c108bc3022f1a03ff530de/tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-microsoft-module/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/parser/microsoft/ooxml/xps/XPSExtractorDecorator.java#L119\r\n\r\nWhen recursively extracting metadata from an XPS file, a simple `HashMap` is used and iterated. However, note that `HashMap` does not gurantee the order of iteration, the extracted metadata have no guaranteed order in the resulting metadata list. And later in the test `org.apache.tika.parser.microsoft.ooxml.xps.XPSParserTest.testVarious`, the test assumes the order of metadata in the list is the same as the `HashMap` insertion order, thus renders the test flaky.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nReplace `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap` to guarantee the iteration order.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce the test\r\n**Java version**: 11.0.20.1\r\n**Maven version**: 3.6.3\r\n\r\n1. Build the module\r\n`mvn clean install -DskipTests -pl tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-microsoft-module -am`\r\n2. Test without shuffling\r\n`mvn -pl tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-microsoft-module test -Dtest=org.apache.tika.parser.microsoft.ooxml.xps.XPSParserTest#testVarious`\r\nThis test passed.\r\n\r\n3. Test with shuffling using [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex)\r\n`mvn -pl tika-parsers/tika-parsers-standard/tika-parsers-standard-modules/tika-parser-microsoft-module edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.tika.parser.microsoft.ooxml.xps.XPSParserTest#testVarious`\r\n\r\nThis test passed with the proposed fix but failed without

These methods update the original DOM, as well as the Elements list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2017\">jhy/jsoup#2017</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Release 1.16.2 [20-Oct-2023]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: optimized the performance of complex CSS selectors, by adding a cost-based query planner. Evaluators\nare sorted by their relative execution cost, and executed in order of lower to higher cost. This speeds the\nmatching process by ensuring that simpler evaluations (such as a tag name match) are conducted prior to more\ncomplex evaluations (such as an attribute regex, or a deep child scan with a :has).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags (and their children). This includes tag namespaces and case\npreservation on applicable tags and attributes.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2008\">jhy/jsoup#2008</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, HTML documents will be placed in the\n<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace by default, per the HTML5 spec. This can be controlled by setting\n<code>W3CDom#namespaceAware(false)</code>.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1848\">jhy/jsoup#1848</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: speed optimized the Structural Evaluators by memoizing previous evaluations. Particularly the <code>~</code>\n(any preceding sibling) and <code>:nth-of-type</code> selectors are improved.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1956\">jhy/jsoup#1956</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of the Element nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling, firstElementSibling,\nlastElementSibling, firstElementChild, and lastElementChild.
