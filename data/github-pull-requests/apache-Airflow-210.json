message/PR title starts with [AIRFLOW-NNNN]. AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID*\r\nUnit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\nCommits follow \"How to write a good git commit message\"\r\nRelevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\nI will engage committers as explained in Contribution Workflow Example.\r\nFor document-only changes commit message can start with [AIRFLOW-XXXX].\r\nReminder to contributors:\r\n\r\nYou must add an Apache License header to all new files\r\nPlease squash your commits when possible and follow the 7 rules of good Git commits\r\nI am new to the community, I am not sure the files are at the right place or missing anything.\r\n\r\nThe sensor could be used as the first node of a dag where the second node can be a TriggerDagRunOperator. The messages are polled in a batch and the dag runs are dynamically generated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNote, as per denied PR #1415, it is important to mention these integrations are not suitable for low-latency/high-throughput/streaming.

I know some teams / orgs like to see the import errors front and center (makes sense) but for such large organizations with thousands of flows, it could be the noise generated from import errors taking up a lot of real estate here. This pr is to introduce an optional config to make it collapsing by default.\r\n\r\nI pass in this config to the view, and use a bit of a statement to make this possible.

Nielsen our data scientists write complex models using Airflow dags. Most of their projects follow this structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel-xyz\r\n├── __init__.py\r\n├── config.yaml\r\n├── dag\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   ├── dag.py\r\n│   └── lib\r\n│       ├── __init__.py\r\n               ...\r\n│       └── my_module.py\r\n├── job_request.yaml\r\n└── tests\r\n    ├── __init__.py\r\n    └── test_lib\r\n        ├── __init__.py\r\n        ├── test.yaml\r\n                 ...\r\n        └── test_my_module.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach model has a dedicated team working on it, is its own git repo and is edited through an IDE. When editing the project, our users may use relative imports and they usually have a root dir (here \"model-xyz\"). They then use a cli tool to zip their projects and send them to the dag home of our Airflow instance. We would prefer not to change the project structure when zipping it. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR, all dags must be defined at the root level in a zip file.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows us to parse dag objects nested inside sub-folders. It is backwards compatible with the default value and allows for more customization. Some airflow dag projects at Nielsen contain hundreds of python files including tests.

- start`, or `timezone.utcnow() - start_dttm` will work\nfine in 99% of cases, but it has one fatal flaw:\n\nThey both operate on system time, and that can go backwards.\n\nWhile this might be surprising, it can happen -- usually due to clocks\nbeing adjusted.\n\nAnd while it is might seem rare, for long running processes it is more\ncommon than we might expect. Most of these durations are harmless to get\nwrong (just being logs) it is better to be safe than sorry.\n\nAlso the `utcnow()` style I have replaced will be much lighter weight -\ncreating a date time object is a comparatively expensive operation, and\ncomputing a diff between two even more so, _especially_ when compared to\njust subtracting two floats.\n\nTo make the \"common\" case easier of wanting to compute a duration for a\nblock, I have made `Stats.timer()` return an object that has a\n`duration` field.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

init_on_load method used deserialize_value method which\r\nin case of custom XCom backends may perform requests to external\r\nservices (for example downloading file from buckets).\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because wherever we query XCom the resuest would be\r\nsend (for example when listing XCom in webui). This PR proposes implementing\r\norm_deserialize_value which allows overriding this behavior. By default\r\nwe use BaseXCom.deserialize_value.\r\n\r\ncloses: #12315\r\n\r\nI'm testing this with the following backend:\r\n```py\r\nclass GCSXComBackend(BaseXCom):\r\n    PREFIX =

          )\r\n            value = GCSXComBackend.PREFIX + object_name\r\n        return BaseXCom.serialize_value(value)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def deserialize_value(result) -> Any:\r\n        result = BaseXCom.deserialize_value(result)\r\n        if isinstance(result, str) and result.startswith(GCSXComBackend.PREFIX):\r\n            object_name = result.replace(GCSXComBackend.PREFIX, \"\")\r\n            with GCSHook().provide_file(\r\n                bucket_name=GCSXComBackend.BUCKET_NAME,\r\n                object_name=object_name,\r\n            ) as f:\r\n
