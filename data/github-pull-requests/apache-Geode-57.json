PR fixes the problem with AsyncEventListenerDUnitTest being too large (ie containing too many lambda methods). This was showing up as an error in the latest releases of IntelliJ and Eclipse.\r\n\r\nI favored some duplication of code from test to test (actually the private create methods contain some variation from test to test) for a couple reasons: 1) it separates the tests so that you can make changes to one without breaking the others, 2) it improves readability and maintenance by having all of the code in the test instead of spread out over base or helper classes.\r\n\r\nI'll eventually rework the other dunit tests that extend AsyncEventQueueTestBase and then delete AsyncEventQueueTestBase, MyAsyncEventListener, and MyAsyncEventListener2. We might also be able to replace some of the inner classes of my updated DistributedTests with Mockito spies.\r\n\r\ncommit f60c06b1637c37db5388c78b2183b38c6610f3ab (HEAD ->

transactional operation\r\n\r\nTXCommitMessage.combine() was checking to see if a RegionCommit was already\r\nin its collection by using Collection.contains() but RegionCommit doesn't\r\nimplement equals() so this check would return false even if the collection\r\nhad a RegionCommit for the same Region.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to check for the region's path instead.\r\n\r\nYou might notice that I changed some other things in the ClientServerTransactionDUnitTest.  It had a couple of problems that I noticed and addressed.  One was the orderly shutdown of a cache from a ServerConnection thread.  That thread is in an Executor and orderly shutdown terminates the Executor with a long timeout.  I changed the test to do a forced-disconnect.  The other problem was in teardown code that was creating a new cache if one didn't exist and then tearing it down.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

also cleaned up naming and modernized sections that were able to be more modern\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\nThe original ticket calls out two things\r\n1. Removing `authzrequest` private variable which is no longer used in any meaningful way\r\n1. Checking if `getAuthzRequest` is used\r\n`getAuthzRequest` is used in quite a lot of spots, but the second commit removes calls that do not care about the result.  If the maintainers end up not liking that but like the remove of private variable, then it is easier to revert (otherwise one can use the squash in GitHub or I'll squash if politely asked)\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

class `GatewayReceiverMBeanBridge` uses the `MBeanStatsMonitor` to\r\nretrieve the amount of senders currently connected. This statistic\r\ntends to be out of date and heavily depends on the `HostStatSampler`\r\nclass to run periodically and update the data. Whenever a receiver is\r\nstopped its stats are also closed and, as such, the\r\n`clientConnectionCount` is not updated anymore, resulting in a wrong\r\ngateway-sender connected count reported.\r\n\r\n- Fixed some minor warnings.\r\n- Added tests to verify the accuracy of the current gateway-senders\r\n  connected.\r\n- Renamed `WanCommandListDUnitTest` to `ListGatewaysCommandDUnitTest`.\r\n- Modified the `GatewayReceiverMBeanBridge` to retrieve the current\r\n  client connection count from the underlying acceptor instead of\r\n  the `MBeanStatsMonitor` class.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for the following commands to the geode Redis adapter:\r\n1. GEOADD\r\n2. GEOPOS\r\n3. GEODIST\r\n4. GEOHASH\r\n5. GEORADIUS\r\n6. GEORADIUSBYMEMBER\r\n\r\nI am leveraging a lot of the same logic as the SortedSetExecutor used for ZRANGE commands. The geocoding logic is based on the geohash algorithm as used by [Redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis) itself.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [N] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [Y] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)? Merged develop rather than rebased against it, didn't want to run into intermediate conflicts unnecessarily while rebasing.\r\n\r\n- [Y] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [Y] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [Y] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [N/A] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these
