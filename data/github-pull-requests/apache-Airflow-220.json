Our tests run quite a\r\nbit faster now so we should be able to run more complete\r\nmatrixes. We can still exclude individual values of the matrixes\r\nif this is too much.\r\n\r\nMySQL 8 is disabled from breeze for now.

it is. The \"big\" one. Smaller than I thought, but still a very fundamental change!\r\n\r\n~Depends upon #10949, ignore first commit when reviewing please.~\r\n\r\n~This PR is still in draft -- there are one or two TODOs left in the code that will need to be fixed before final merge, and while they are import, there is still enough here to start reviewing.~\r\n\r\n- [x] Test that my forward-port of the changes actually works again. (I wanted to get the code up for review, so there may be some transcription errors breaking things.)\r\n- [x] DAG SLAs need to happen via the parsing process\r\n- [x] Adding back dagrun_timeout support\r\n- [x] dag_run.verify_integrity is slow, and we don't want to call it every time, just when the dag structure changes (which we can know now thanks to DAG Serialization)\r\n- [x] Add a savepoint in verify_integrity (to avoid rollback killing the whole transaction and releasing the locks. \r\n- [x] Produce benchmark figures against this branch, not a 4 month old version of master branch.\r\n- [x] Unit test the hell out of this.\r\n- [x] Add config option to disable all locking (a.k.a. escape hatch) in case of unforseen MySQL performance issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements scheduler HA as proposed in AIP-15. The high level design is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Move all scheduling decisions into SchedulerJob (requiring DAG serialization in the scheduler)\r\n- Use row-level locks to ensure schedulers don't stomp on each other\r\n  (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`)\r\n- Use `SKIP LOCKED` for better performance when multiple schedulers are\r\n  running. (Mysql < 8 and MariaDB don't support this)\r\n- Scheduling decisions are not tied to the parsing speed, but can\r\n  operate just on the database\r\n\r\n**DagFileProcessorProcess**:\r\n\r\nPreviously this component was responsible for more than just parsing the\r\nDAG files as it's name might imply. It also was responsible for creating\r\nDagRuns, and also making scheduling decisions of TIs, sending them from\r\n\"None\" to \"scheduled\" state.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes it so that the DagFileProcessorProcess now will\r\nupdate the SerializedDAG row for this DAG, and make no scheduling\r\ndecisions itself.\r\n\r\nTo make the scheduler's job easier (so that it can make as many\r\ndecisions as possible without having to load the possibly-large\r\nSerializedDAG row) we store/update some columns on the DagModel table:\r\n\r\n- `next_dagrun`: The execution_date of the next dag run that should be created (or\r\n  None)\r\n- `next_dagrun_create_after`: The earliest point at which the next dag\r\n  run can be created\r\n\r\nPre-computing these values (and updating them every time the DAG is\r\nparsed) reduce the overall load on the DB as many decisions can be taken\r\nby selecting just these two columns/the small DagModel row.\r\n\r\nIn case of max_active_runs, or `@once` these columns will be set to\r\nnull, meaning \"don't create any dag runs\"\r\n\r\n**SchedulerJob**\r\n\r\nThe SchedulerJob used to only queue/send tasks to the executor after\r\nthey were parsed, and returned from the DagFileProcessorProcess.\r\n\r\nThis PR breaks the link between parsing and enqueuing of tasks, instead\r\nof looking at DAGs as they are parsed, we now:\r\n\r\n-  store a new datetime column, `last_scheduling_decision` on DagRun\r\n  table, signifying when a scheduler last examined a DagRun\r\n- Each time around the loop the scheduler will get (and lock) the next\r\n  _n_ DagRuns via `DagRun.next_dagruns_to_examine`, prioritising DagRuns\r\n  which haven't been touched by a scheduler in the longest period\r\n- SimpleTaskInstance etc have been almost entirely removed now, as we\r\n  use the serialized versions\r\n\r\nPart of #9630\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

can happen when a task is enqueued by one executor, and then that\r\nscheduler dies/exits.\r\n\r\nThe default fallback behaviour is unchanged -- that queued tasks are\r\ncleared and then and then later rescheduled.\r\n\r\nBut for Celery we can do better -- if we record the Celery-generated\r\ntask_id, we can then re-create the AsyncResult objects for orphaned\r\ntasks at a later date.\r\n\r\nHowever since Celery just reports all AsyncResult as \"PENDING\", even if\r\nthey aren't tasks currently in the broker queue, we need to apply a\r\ntimeout to \"unblock\" these tasks in case they never actually made it to\r\nthe Celery broker.\r\n\r\nThis all means that we can adopt tasks that have been enqueued another\r\nCeleryExecutor if it dies, without having to clear the task and slow\r\ndown. This is especially useful as the task may have already started\r\nrunning, and while clearing it would stop it, it's better if we don't\r\nhave to reset it!\r\n\r\nPart of #9630\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

to make one of the more complex UI interactions more intuitive with the following edits:\r\n\r\n### Task Instance Modal\r\n\r\n- Adds \"X\" button to close modal in the top-right as intended by Bootstrap patterns (\"Close\" button in the bottom-right still persists as well).\r\n- Cleaned up the presentation the modal header by adding \"Task Instance/at\" label/prefixes and moving the very randomly placed Filter (icon) button down with the options below as a \"Filter Upstream\" button. \r\n- Removed the \"primary\" button styling from each of the buttons in the group row (\"Task Instance Details\", \"Rendered\", etc.). This wasn't appropriate usage of a \"primary\" styling as that designation is used to establish a visual hierarchy—in this case all of the actions are considered comparable.\r\n- Re-ordered each \"action\" form. (buttons on right instead of left) Forms should flow top to bottom OR left to right. This aligns with the user flow of electing the related options and then submitting the form.\r\n- Improved the accessibility of the \"action\" forms by refactoring the underlying markup/scripting to each be wrapped in their own `<form></form>` tags so that they can be individually submitted via keyboard (depending on focus).\r\n- Updated the screenshot of this modal [in the docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/ui.html#task-instance-context-menu).\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/93137393-630f2980-f6ab-11ea-9d22-ac568db826f8.png)  |  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/93137153-06137380-f6ab-11ea-871d-1470365982fe.png) |\r\n\r\n### DAG Modal\r\nApplies patterns consistent with updates to the Task Instance Modal:\r\n- Added \"DAG:\" prefix to the modal header\r\n- Added \"X\" close button in top-right of modal\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/93137258-2a6f5000-f6ab-11ea-9be4-46b6ca4907bc.png)|  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/93137192-14618f80-f6ab-11ea-9c6e-304c4b089b2e.png) |\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-14T21:36:09Z","updated_at":"2020-11-21T00:05:31Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T21:30:37Z","merged_at":"2020-09-16T21:30:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffa33e44affdfc9e8a53119a9a6461626d431546","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

#10292\r\n\r\nWhen using the KubernetesExecutor, if the generated pod name is longer than 63 bytes, the host name inside the pod will be truncated to 63 bytes to comply with the DNS label RFC.

Currently, when using the KubernetesExecutor, it assumes a pod with a `name==ti.hostname` exists and tries fetching the logs for it.

we switch over to using row-level locks more in the scheduler, it's\r\nis better if we don't have transactions hang around being open \"for\r\never\", otherwise an errant process may end up holding on to a lock for a\r\nlot longer than we intend.\r\n\r\nFor example, on mysql the default lock wait timeout is 50s. We could\r\nhave set `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` to a shorter value -- but that only\r\naffects the waiting side, not the locking side. So instead we set an\r\nidle timeout -- if the transaction is not doing anything we ask the DB\r\nserver to kill it, ending the transaction and freeing any held row\r\nlocks.\r\n\r\nPart of #9630.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The problem is described\r\n(but only workarounded) in\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2960.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to disable --warn-unused-ignore flag.\r\nThere is little harm in having

is my proposition of solving issue [#10381](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10381) \r\n\r\nClass `DataprocSubmitJobOperator` in package `airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataproc` has now `on_kill` method. Since canceling job requires access to `DataprocHook` and `job_id` I added `hook` and `job_id` as properties in `DataprocSubmitJobOperator` class.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\nClass `TestDataprocSubmitJobOperator` in package `tests.providers.google.cloud.operators.test_dataproc` has now `test_on_kill` method.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
