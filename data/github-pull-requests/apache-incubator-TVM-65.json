we analysis block read/write regions, there are constraints on iter vars not defined within block body. These vars should not be relaxed, but do affect the actual accessed regions. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor i in range(16):\r\n  with T.block():\r\n      if i < 8: \r\n        # access X[i]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent analysis will ignore the constraint `i < 8` (`i` is free when analyzing on the block's scope), and get the read region `T.reads([X[i:i+1])`. This would be an overly relaxed region. If the block nodes are designed to isolate the inner behaviors, the conditional access info will get lost in the read/write annotations.\r\n\r\nThe pr make a trial to keep awareness also on the free iter vars out of relaxed domain in `BlockReadWriteDetector`. The result region is intersected with itself relaxed on the domain of free vars. For the case above, it would be `[i, i+1) ^ [0, 8)`, thus if i >= 8, the read region of X becomes

propose that the JSON deserializer defaults fields to null.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is increased backwards compatibility. I need to add virtual device to the VisitAttrs of most Relay nodes for #9826. Unfortunately, this means that JSON that does not have the virtual device in it is invalid, and we have to manually add \"virtual_device_\": \"0\" to many of the nodes in JSON to get it to import correctly. \r\n\r\nAfter this change, if a JSON node does not contain the virtual_device_ field, it will still import the JSON correctly. By default it will set the value of the field to \"0\", which represents null.

Used for let-bindings, loop iteration variables, \r\n* Set LLVM block names based on those present in TIR.  (e.g. `for_body_x.outer` instead of `for_body`)\r\n* Utility function `CreatePrintf` for inserting a `printf()` call into the generated LLVM IR.\r\n* Utility function `CreateLookupReturnAddress`, to check the return address of the current function call.

have encountered \"list index out of range\" when parsing the keras LSTM. Then I dived in to this problem.\r\n\r\nI found that when using keras LSTVM and set \"use_bies=False\", this would lead to the \"list index out of range\" exception, because at this time, the **weightList** only contains two tensors, and tvm  will fall on fetching **weightList[2]**. \r\n\r\nSo I made a little improvment  by adding *if* statement and added some new test cases.","created_at":"2022-01-06T07:35:43Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T05:55:18Z","closed_at":"2022-01-31T05:55:18Z","merged_at":"2022-01-31T05:55:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8d00530bb62e6919152a57c5abc59f5f69c8b1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icem

some unregistered ops to the default AMP lists.\r\n\r\nBy default the pass places unregistered ops to the follow list so this does not change behavior. It does suppress some errors though.\r\n\r\n`nn.depth_to_space` -- this is just a fancy reshape op so should be in follow list\r\n\r\n`argmax`, `argmin` -- this one is pretty much the same computation as in `min` and `max` which are in the follow lists\r\n\r\n`fast_*` -- these fast operations use approximations involving polynomials in a clipped domain of the normal functions. They seem safe, though `fast_tanh` has coefficients outside of representable range of fp16 (which I think is fine)\r\n\r\n`clip` -- usually used to implement relu6, might have problems if clip range

PR is part of the stage M3c of the meta schedule project (#8473).\r\n\r\nThe architecture is re-designed by Junru and Xiyou. In this PR we introduced  another variant of search strategy, evolutionary search. The evolutionary search strategy utilizes a cost model to effectively find candidates which are preferred to have high score, i.e., potentially very fast running time.\r\n\r\nUnittests are also updated in this PR.

All,\r\n\r\nI encountered an issue that the comparison between the output tensor and itself.\r\n1. `Rank-0` Tensor. Do not support comparison even if compare to the tensor itself. There is a use case that tensorize a no keep-dims reduction compute to an HW intrinsic, and it is will be failed in the [buffer bind step](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/9cc1df60701d6d46577d028c211bb568225fc4f1/python/tvm/te/tensor_intrin.py#L131).  \r\n2. Other Tensor. Every time when invoking `tensor.op.output(i)`, the address of the tensor is charged, it is a little bit confusing. The result is that we cannot simply use `same_as` to check a tensor. \r\n\r\nSo I added the `outputs` member in `class Operation`, and recorded the output tensors on the first invocation of `Operation::output`. This is a minor change and would be the simplest way to fix it. :)\r\n\r\nWhat is more, I did not modify the functions `output_dtype` and `output_shape`

for the presence of the \"primal\" axis `C` when it finds a \"non-primal\" axis `c`. In the test case in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9813, the reduction is over the channel dimension, so the `C` axis would be gone unless `keepdims = True`. But `ReduceInferCorrectLayout` had a bug where it always preserved the inner `1c` when the reduction is over the channel dimension. This resulted in an invalid layout `NHW1c`. \r\n\r\n@ganler @comaniac

adds support for fusing a residual block of the form `UnaryOp(BinaryOp(ActivationOp(TensorOp(X) + bias), residual))` into one cutlass kernel, which I thought was not possible until recently. As discussed in https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/discussions/347#discussioncomment-1830989, it turns out that [one of cutlass conv2d kernels](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/master/include/cutlass/conv/kernel/implicit_gemm_convolution_with_fused_epilogue.h#L61) already supports computing `elementwise(alpha x conv + beta x C + per_channel_bias)`. With [a little tweak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/pull/391) (or one might say it is an abuse of the intended API usage), it is possible to support fully general residual blocks found in deep learning models.\r\n\r\nAs expected, this brings good speedup on resnet based models (resnet50 and DETR-R50 below). On other models, speedup is modest or it even becomes worse (`deeplabv3`, strange result, haven't looked into what's going on).\r\n\r\n@comaniac @Laurawly  @hwu36 \r\n\r\nModel name | Input size |

All,\r\n\r\nSometimes, we should manipulate the Passes order or add new Passes not only for `Relay Pass` but for `TIR Pass`.  the This PR add the configuration `tir.add_lower_pass` to `--pass-config`.

PR changes a behavior in schedule primitive decompose-reduction. Prior to this PR, loops outside the newly created init block always have the for-kind \"serial\". And this PR changes this behavior, letting the new loops inherit the for-kinds from the old loops.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons for this change:\r\n* If the new loops don't inherit the for-kinds, their for-kinds is impossible to be changed once after the decompose-reduction. This is because after decompose-reduction, the init block and the update block write to a same buffer. Thus the compact-dataflow property is no longer satisfied (more specifically, the \"dominant\" property is no longer satisfied). And in this case, we cannot apply vectorization or parallelization to those loops.\r\n* From the perspective of performance, it makes sense to let the new loops have the same for-kinds as the original

Issue\r\n  `debug_executor` workflow described in https://tvm.apache.org/docs/arch/debugger.html#how-to-use-debugger has strange behavior. When I used code from the step 4, the result of inference differs from time to time. After a short investigation, I found that the `params` are not set correctly. Code that I used:\r\n  ```python\r\n  onnx_model = onnx.load(\"./resnet50-v2-7.onnx\")\r\n  mod, params = relay.frontend.from_onnx(onnx_model, {'data': (1, 3, 224, 224)})\r\n  with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):\r\n        lib = relay.build(mod, target=\"llvm\", params=params)\r\n  lib_name = \"lib.so\"\r\n  lib.export_library(lib_name)\r\n\r\n  loaded_lib = tvm.runtime.load_module(lib_name)\r\n  m = graph_executor.create(loaded_lib[\"get_graph_json\"](), loaded_lib, dev, dump_root=\"/tmp/tvmdbg\")\r\n  m.set_input('data', tvm.nd.array(data.astype(dtype)))\r\n  m.set_input(**params)\r\n  m.run()\r\n  tvm_out = m.get_output(0, tvm.nd.empty(out_shape, dtype)).numpy()\r\n\r\n- Solution\r\n  - Implementation of `get_graph_params` function, which allows to get params directly from the lib file. Thus a single line can be added to the debugger example code:\r\n    ```python\r\n    lib = tvm.runtime.load_module(\"network.so\")\r\n    params = lib['get_graph_params']() # <-----\r\n    m = graph_executor.create(lib[\"get_graph_json\"](), lib, dev, dump_root=\"/tmp/tvmdbg\")\r\n    # set inputs\r\n    m.set_input('data', tvm.nd.array(data.astype(dtype)))\r\n    m.set_input(**params)\r\n    # execute\r\n    m.run()\r\n    tvm_out = m.get_output(0, tvm.nd.empty(out_shape, dtype)).numpy()\r\n    ```\r\n    After this the result of inference will be correct.\r\n  - As a additional mark, special warning was added.

All,\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix the Target constructing issue. I just found an error when invoking `relay.backend._backend.build` from the python side. After `build_target_by_device_type_map`, we got a dict target and it will be converted to Map when calling `relay.backend._backend.build`, because it is a global function.

#7892\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8596\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n1. There are multiple affinity function using \"LINUX\" and \"ANDROID\" macro check and the multiple check make the logic maintain and change become complex.\r\n\r\n2. Current logic of tvm [Runtime][ThreadPool] assume all of the cpu resources are available for\r\na single backend runtime to do the data flow computation. But such assumption may not\r\ntrue when user running multiple task on the system and not want tvm task\r\nexhaust all of the cpu resource, or when user going to run multiple backend\r\nruntime of tvm on the system, each backend runtime of tvm should use different cpu\r\naffinity settings to achieve best performance.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n 1. Refactor the affinity functions to move the \"LINUX\" and \"ANDROID\" check into one function.\r\n\r\n 2. In this solution, we introduce a new \"CPU AffinityMode type\" named \"kSpecify\", by using \"kSpecify\" and the function named \"tvm::runtime::threading ::Configure\" user can specify the cpu list for the cpu affinity of a backend runtime. This solution reused the existing per thread thread pool logic of [Runtime][Threadpool] that created a worker thread pool for current thread which can running a particular runtime. for a multiple runtime use case, user can first launch multiple threads, then call \"tvm::runtime::threading ::Configure\" with cpu list to create tvm data flow worker thread pool, after doing this the execution of the multiple runtime on the multiple threads will use different cpu resource list .\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-24T01:26:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T09:33:13Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T09:33:13Z","merged_at":"2022-03-01T09:33:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e353d5cdc4dffebf05e94dd75f64fe2a9f322c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/use

when we enumerate cutlass kernels for profiling, for each parameter config we generate all variants of the kernel with different epilogues. See for example\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1afcf36d311acf04873bd1985c0c832fc2fa1771/python/tvm/contrib/cutlass/gen_gemm.py#L67-L106\r\n\r\nAfter profiling, we select which variant of epilogue to use based on the pattern name:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1afcf36d311acf04873bd1985c0c832fc2fa1771/python/tvm/contrib/cutlass/build.py#L219-L230 \r\n\r\nThis approach simply doesn't work when we introduce support for residual connection fusion, because there are so many different kinds of epilogues. \r\n\r\nThe idea of this change is to split kernel generation into two steps:\r\n(1) First, we generate all kernels without any epilogue. This is used for profiling \r\n(2) After profiling decides the best parameter configuration, use that information to generate a single kernel with the required epilogue. \r\n\r\nOverall I believe this refactoring of kernel generation and selection have made things much cleaner, and makes us well-prepared for residual block fusion.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @Laurawly

PR is part of the stage M3c of the meta schedule project (#8473).\r\n\r\nThe architecture is re-designed by Junru and Xiyou. In this PR we modified the design of multiple classes and added post processings, mutators to the meta schedule framework. Also more concrete classes would be added later. We intend to make the interfaces more flexible yet user-friendly with updates in the PR, mostly in SearchStrategy class.\r\n\r\nUnittests are also updated in this PR.

PR add get_packed_func interface to GenericFunc. This interface is used to get the packed function specified for the current target. As a third-party user, we can use this interface along with python context manager to temporary override op strategy with our own device strategy. \r\nWe can create temporary stratey registry as below:\r\n```python\r\nwith TempOpStrategy(\"nn.conv2d\", \"cuda\", general_strategy):\r\n    lib = relay.build(...)\r\n```\r\nWe save the current strategy function when TempOpStrategy init and register the strategy funtion back when TempOpStrtegy exit.\r\n```python\r\nclass TempOpStrategy(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, op_name, target, fstrategy):\r\n        generic_fstrategy = relay.op.get(op_name).get_attr(\"FTVMStrategy\")\r\n        self.op_name = op_name\r\n        self.target = target\r\n        with tvm.target.Target(target) as target_obj:\r\n

PR is part of the stage M3c of the meta schedule project (#8473).\r\n\r\nThe architecture is re-designed by Junru and Xiyou. In this PR we implemented multiple measure callbacks which make sure the autotuning results are processed properly (store in database, log to screen & update in cost model) and the tuning environment is cleaned. The PR also supports customization of measure callbacks on the python side.\r\n\r\nUnittests are also introduced in this PR.

This PR will remain as 'draft' until both dependencies are merged.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm described in the RFC uses two metrics for pareto culling, performance and memory usage. This commit addresses the former and introduces the basis of performance estimation for the Parts.

fairly certain that this bugfix is correct, but please check my code. I'm not sure how this hasn't caused more problems for people! Perhaps the malloced memory is usually filled with 0s? Either way, on my system, the malloced memory was NOT all 0s, and so when we would copy the `key.size()` valid characters of `key` into `*out_type_key`, it was likely that the next character was not 0, and thus, because no terminator was copied over, the string wouldn't be terminated correctly. This fix ensures the terminator gets copied over, by copying `key.size() + 1` characters.","created_at":"2021-12-20T05:51:40Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T14:27:17Z","closed_at":"2021-12-20T14:27:17Z","merged_at":"2021-12-20T14:27:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"72ff7c8db88ac52d518ce5171a00d0ab9ea1af7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":""

Community,\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am working on the Heterogeneous Execution by using `Composite Target`. I found it is not included in the `Device.STR2MASK` map and will be failed when compiling with it. So, I added it back and checked all the other targets. Not surprisingly, there are some other issues. Now, I add a `Consistency verification case` to help us check it. :)\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, I still have some doubts.\r\n1.  Since introducing the new `Target System`,  the device type is saved in each Target (`tvm.target.Target.kind`). It seems that some attributes of the Device in `runtime_ctypes.py` are redundant, such as `MASK2STR` and `STR2MASK`. Then the issue raised here is the same or equaled features located in different locations make things messy. I think we can refactor the `Runtime Device`.\r\n2. It seems that the devices of `Composite Target` cannot be optimized or even recognized by all relay passes. Ideally, the `Partition Pass` can perform the partitioning and annotation automatically based on those devices (order does matter), and then select the best op strategy. So my question is: What is the current status for `Composite Target` and is anyone working on it?\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.

think current check_ function in PatternPartitioner should only check exprs in current matched group, exclude of exprs outside of the matched group(these exprs are  deemed as args of current group). For example, if a target has a very special requirement for nn.pad, such as requires pad_value equal to 0. we has defined thousands of patterns for the target and nn.pad exists in many of them. Current check_ function is impossible to distinguish nn.pad in current group from nn.pad in args of current group, but I only care about whether nn.pad in current group  is valid for the

building `tvm-sys`, the `TVMInstall::build_path` is set to `{build_dir}/{revision_branch}/build` and the `TVMInstall::source_path` is set to `{build_dir}/{revision_branch}/source`. But when using the `TVM_HOME` env var it uses the contents of the var as the path for both. This means there's no way to use `tvm-build` to manually build TVM and then use `TVM_HOME` to have `tvm-sys` compile bindings. It won't know where to find headers. \r\n\r\nThis fix just appends `build` and `source` to each `build_path` and `source_path` respectively in the case `TVM_HOME` is used so that it mimics the default behavior.\r\n\r\n@jroesch @imalsogreg
