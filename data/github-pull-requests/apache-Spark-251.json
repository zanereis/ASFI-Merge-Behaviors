In fact, we know of at least one resolved in only 3.4.0+ (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11358). They may not affect Spark, but, if the update isn't painful, maybe worthwhile in order to make future 3.x updates easier.\r\n\r\njQuery 1 -> 2 doesn't sound like a breaking change, as 2.0 is supposed to maintain compatibility with 1.9+ (https://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/)\r\n\r\n2 -> 3 has breaking changes: https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/. It's hard to evaluate each one, but the most likely area for problems is in ajax(). However, our usage of jQuery (and plugins) is pretty simple.\r\n\r\nUpdate jquery to 3.4.1; update jquery blockUI and mustache to latest\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing of docs build (except R docs), worker/master UI, spark application UI.\r\nNote: this really doesn't guarantee it works, as our tests can't test javascript, and this is merely anecdotal testing, although I clicked about every link I could find. There's a risk this breaks a minor part of the UI; it does seem to work fine in the main.","created_at":"2019-06-11T19:39:21Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T19:11:37Z","closed_at":"2019-06-15T05:23:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5d5d7137b64f61034e27abce104cad223c2d832","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo support GPU-aware scheduling in Standalone (cluster mode), Worker should have ability to setup resources(e.g. GPU/FPGA) when it starts up.\r\n\r\nSimilar as driver/executor do, Worker has two ways(resourceFile & resourceDiscoveryScript) to setup resources when it starts up.  User could use `SPARK_WORKER_OPTS` to apply resource configs on Worker in the form of \"-Dx=y\". For example,\r\n```\r\nSPARK_WORKER_OPTS=\"-Dspark.worker.resource.gpu.amount=2 \\\r\n                   -Dspark.worker.resource.fpga.amount=1 \\\r\n                   -Dspark.worker.resource.fpga.discoveryScript=/Users/wuyi/tmp/getFPGAResources.sh \\\r\n                   -Dspark.worker.resourcesFile=/Users/wuyi/tmp/worker-resource-file\"\r\n ```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually in Standalone locally:\r\n\r\n- Worker could start up normally when no resources are configured\r\n\r\n- Worker should fail to start up when exception threw during setup resources(e.g. unknown directory, parse fail)\r\n\r\n- Worker could setup resources from resource file\r\n\r\n- Worker could setup resources from discovery scripts\r\n\r\n- Worker should setup resources from resource file & discovery scripts when both are configure.","created_at":"2019-06-11T12:02:50Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T02:41:37Z","closed_at":"2019-06-27T02:23:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2edefda0d469bf86f0558363a3a6cde5bb888878","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen Arrow optimization is enabled in Python 2.7, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas\r\npdf = pandas.DataFrame([\"test1\", \"test2\"])\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(pdf)\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI got the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------------+\r\n|               0|\r\n+----------------+\r\n|[74 65 73 74 31]|\r\n|[74 65 73 74 32]|\r\n+----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks because Python's `str` and `byte` are same. it does look right:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> str == bytes\r\nTrue\r\n>>> isinstance(\"a\", bytes)\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo cut it short:\r\n\r\n1. Python 2 treats `str` as `bytes`.\r\n2. PySpark added some special codes and hacks to recognizes `str` as string types.\r\n3. PyArrow / Pandas followed Python 2 difference\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fix, we have two options:\r\n\r\n1. Fix it to match the behaviour to PySpark's\r\n2. Note the differences\r\n\r\n but Python 2 is deprecated anyway. I think it's better to just note it and for go option 2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\nDoc was checked too:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-11 at 6 40 07

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently with `toLocalIterator()` and `toPandas()` with Arrow enabled, if the Spark job being run in the background serving thread errors, it will be caught and sent to Python through the PySpark serializer. \r\nThis is not the ideal solution because it is only catch a SparkException, it won't handle an error that occurs in the serializer, and each method has to have it's own special handling to propagate the error.\r\n\r\nThis PR instead returns the Python Server object along with the serving port and authentication info, so that it allows the Python caller to join with the serving thread. During the call to join, the serving thread Future is completed either successfully or with an exception. In the latter case, the exception will be propagated to Python through the Py4j call.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests","created_at":"2019-06-10T22:11:58Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T20:10:46Z","closed_at":"2019-06-26T20:09:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e522bdbc11a5cffb9b88382a08091024dc0ac21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20eb7487962a49c928003167a8d7e3cfaff54dbc","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-propagate-server-error-SPARK-27992","ref":"pyspark-propagate-server-error-SPARK-27992","sha":"20eb7487962a49c928003167a8d7e3cfaff54dbc","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvide a way to recursively load data from datasource.\r\nI add a \"recursiveFileLookup\" option.\r\n\r\nWhen \"recursiveFileLookup\" option turn on, then partition inferring is turned off and all files from the directory will be loaded recursively.\r\n\r\nIf some datasource explicitly specify the partitionSpec, then if user turn on \"recursive\" option, then exception will be thrown.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative approach for #24734.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Respects `spark.buffer.size` in Python workers.\r\n2. Adds a runtime buffer size configuration for Pandas UDFs, `spark.sql.pandas.udf.buffer.size` (which falls back to `spark.buffer.size`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe original issue SPARK-27798 was reported on master branch. When using `from_avro` to deserialize avro data to catalyst StructType format, if `ConvertToLocalRelation` is applied at the time, `from_avro` produces only the last value (overriding previous values).\r\n\r\nThe cause is `AvroDeserializer` reuses output row for StructType. But `ConvertToLocalRelation` doesn't tolerate expression reusing output object.\r\n\r\nThis is to backport the fix of `ConvertToLocalRelation` to branch 2.3.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2019-06-08T03:14:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:36:29Z","closed_at":"2019-06-08T19:11:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99adeaebfb97e494dd83ea2f440a7000404d0a33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc8d60993fe2f2611c07eba190eef96ddb1c1dc8","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-27798-2.3","ref":"SPARK-27798-2.3","sha":"bc8d60993fe2f2611c07eba190eef96ddb1c1dc8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd an abstraction layer for the Resource layer stuff to make it more readable.  \r\nI think the only actual behavioral change here is that now you can specify both a resourceFileOpt and the discovery script for different resources and it will join them together.  Previously it only allowed one or the other option to be used.  I did also add in one more warning for the user when the resource configurations will waste resources.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and ran on local cluster,

change adds a new option that enables dynamic allocation without\r\nthe need for a shuffle service. This mode works by tracking which stages\r\ngenerate shuffle files, and keeping executors that generate data for those\r\nshuffles alive while the jobs that use them are active.\r\n\r\nA separate timeout is also added for shuffle data; so that executors that\r\nhold shuffle data can use a separate timeout before being removed because\r\nof being idle. This allows the shuffle data to be kept around in case it\r\nis needed by some new job, or allow users to be more aggressive in timing\r\nout executors that don't have shuffle data in active use.\r\n\r\nThe code also hooks up to the context cleaner so that shuffles that are\r\ngarbage collected are detected, and the respective executors not held\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\nTesting done with added unit tests, and also with TPC-DS workloads on\r\nYARN without a shuffle

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe newly added `Refresh` method in PR #24401 prevented the work of moving DataSourceV2Relation into catalyst. It calls `case table: FileTable => table.fileIndex.refresh()` while `FileTable` belongs to sql/core.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, Ryan Blue pointed out DataSourceV2Relation is immutable by design, it should not have refresh method.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the resource config spark.{executor/driver}.resource.{resourceName}.count to .amount to allow future usage of containing both a count and a unit.  Right now we only support counts - # of gpus for instance, but in the future we may want to support units for things like memory - 25G. I think making the user only have to specify a single config .amount is better then making them specify 2 separate configs of a .count and then a .unit.  Change it now since its a user facing config.\r\n\r\nAmount also matches how the spark on yarn configs are setup.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manually verified on yarn and local cluster

Spark SQL parser can have pretty confusing error messages when parsing an incorrect SELECT SQL statement. The proposed fix has the following effect.\r\n\r\nBEFORE:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE x NOT NULL;\r\nError in query:\r\nmismatched input 'FROM' expecting {<EOF>, 'CLUSTER', 'DISTRIBUTE', 'EXCEPT', 'GROUP', 'HAVING', 'INTERSECT', 'LATERAL', 'LIMIT', 'ORDER', 'MINUS', 'SORT', 'UNION', 'WHERE', 'WINDOW'}(line 1, pos 9)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSELECT * FROM test WHERE x NOT NULL\r\n---------^^^\r\n```\r\nwhere in fact the error message should be hinted to be near `NOT NULL`.\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE x NOT NULL;\r\nError in query:\r\nmismatched input 'NOT' expecting {<EOF>, 'AND', 'CLUSTER', 'DISTRIBUTE', 'EXCEPT', 'GROUP', 'HAVING', 'INTERSECT', 'LIMIT', 'OR', 'ORDER', 'MINUS', 'SORT', 'UNION', 'WINDOW'}(line 1, pos 27)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSELECT * FROM test WHERE x NOT NULL\r\n---------------------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, this problem is brought by some problematic Spark SQL grammar. There are two kinds of SELECT statements that are supported by Hive (and thereby supported in SparkSQL):\r\n* `FROM table SELECT blahblah SELECT blahblah`\r\n* `SELECT blah FROM table`\r\n\r\n*Reference* [HiveQL single-from stmt grammar](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/HiveParser.g)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is fine when these two SELECT syntaxes are supported separately. However, since we are currently supporting these two kinds of syntaxes in a single ANTLR rule, this can be problematic and therefore leading to confusing parser errors. This is because when a  SELECT clause was parsed, it can't tell whether the following FROM clause actually belongs to it or is just the beginning of a new `FROM table SELECT *` statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Modify ANTLR grammar to fix the above-mentioned problem. This fix is important because the previous problematic grammar does affect a lot of real-world queries. Due to the previous problematic and messy grammar, we refactored the grammar related to `querySpecification`.\r\n2. Modify `AstBuilder` to have separate visitors for `SELECT ... FROM ...` and `FROM ... SELECT ...` statements.\r\n3. Drop the `FROM table` statement, which is supported by accident and is actually parsed in the wrong code path. Both Hive and Presto do not support this syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs and new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-05T18:34:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T11:26:33Z","closed_at":"2019-06-12T01:35:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abdc0867e6c15e21b0a523ff6aadc2d757527534","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b174e52b6f7bad2ea85f6fa844af3f1e1ffbbb1","head":{"label":"yeshengm:parser-refactor","ref":"parser-refactor","sha":"7b174e52b6f7bad2ea85f6fa844af3f1e1ffbbb1","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark version 2.4 and earlier, when inserting into a table, Spark will cast the data type of input query to the data type of target table by coercion. This can be super confusing if users make a mistake and write string values to an int column. Users won't get error/warning and see null values in the target table.\r\n\r\nSince Spark 3.0, by default only upcasting is allowed when inserting data into table. E.g. `int` -> `long` and `int` -> `string` are allowed, while `long` -> `int` or `string` -> `int` are not allowed. The old behaviour is preserved under a newly added configuration `spark.sql.legacy.insertUnsafeCasts` with a default value of `false`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-05T14:59:07Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T23:47:54Z","closed_at":"2019-11-22T23:47:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30828354d1624b0a7547c9eb274b597b1244d910","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e2949131a8a7579149a7dd4153650461f5b5da2","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:SPARK-27856","ref":"SPARK-27856","sha":"3e2949131a8a7579149a7dd4153650461f5b5da2","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using `from_avro` to deserialize avro data to catalyst StructType format, if `ConvertToLocalRelation` is applied at the time, `from_avro` produces only the last value (overriding previous values).\r\n\r\nThe cause is `AvroDeserializer` reuses output row for StructType. Normally, it should be fine in Spark SQL. But `ConvertToLocalRelation` just uses `InterpretedProjection` to project local rows. `InterpretedProjection` creates new row for each output thro, it includes the same nested row object from `AvroDeserializer`. By the end, converted local relation has only last value.\r\n\r\nI think there're two possible options:\r\n\r\n1. Make `AvroDeserializer` output new row for StructType.\r\n2. Use `InterpretedMutableProjection` in `ConvertToLocalRelation` and call `copy()` on output rows.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is chose because previously `ConvertToLocalRelation` also creates new rows, this `InterpretedMutableProjection` + `copy()` shoudn't bring too much performance penalty. `ConvertToLocalRelation` should be arguably less critical, compared with `AvroDeserializer`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-05T10:59:58Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:36:28Z","closed_at":"2019-06-07T20:52:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd10e12b6e494c976252de13e55a5cdbe3f8a7e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/69996a61a8f1c8e0cba6a50f5f93f00e40d23c3b","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-27798","ref":"SPARK-27798","sha":"69996a61a8f1c8e0cba6a50f5f93f00e40d23c3b","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new config properties: `spark.driver.defaultJavaOptions` and `spark.executor.defaultJavaOptions`. These are intended to be set by administrators in a file of defaults for options like JVM garbage collection algorithm. Users will still set `extraJavaOptions` properties, and both sets of JVM options will be added to start a JVM (default options are prepended to extra options).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, function `substr/substring`'s usage is like `substring(string_expression, n1 [,n2])`. \r\n\r\nBut, the ANSI SQL defined the pattern for substr/substring is like `SUBSTRING(str FROM n1 [FOR n2])`. This gap makes some inconvenient when we switch to the SparkSQL.\r\n\r\n- ANSI SQL-92: http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt\r\n\r\nBelow are the mainly DB engines to support the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI was researching getting Spark’s Kinesis integration running locally against `localstack`. We found this issue, and it creates a complication: https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/677\r\n\r\nEffectively, we need to be able to redirect calls for Kinesis, DynamoDB and Cloudwatch in order for the KCL to properly use the `localstack` infrastructure. We have successfully done this with the KCL (both 1.x and 2.x), but with Spark’s integration we are unable to configure DynamoDB and Cloudwatch’s endpoints:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/external/kinesis-asl/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/kinesis/KinesisReceiver.scala#L162\r\n\r\nThis PR adds optional configuration values to the interfaces for dynamoDBEndpointUrl and cloudWatchMetricsLevel. \r\n\r\nWhy cloudWatchMetricsLevel instead of cloudWatchEndpointUrl? Because the 1.x version of the KCL does not expose a means of configuring the cloudWatchEndpointUrl. Localstack users can instead disable metrics entirely by setting the cloudWatchMetricsLevel to Some(MetricsLevel.NONE)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests were expanded to check that these values were set.\r\n\r\nPlease review https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHandle the case when ParsedStatement subclass has a Map field but not of type Map[String, String].\r\n\r\nIn ParsedStatement.productIterator, `case mapArg: Map[_, _]` can match any Map type due to type erasure, thus causing `asInstanceOf[Map[String, String]]` to throw ClassCastException.\r\n\r\nThe following test reproduces the issue:\r\n```\r\ncase class TestStatement(p: Map[String, Int]) extends ParsedStatement {\r\n override def output: Seq[Attribute] = Nil\r\n override def children: Seq[LogicalPlan] = Nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nTestStatement(Map(\"abc\" -> 1)).toString\r\n```\r\nChanging the code to `case mapArg: Map[String, String]` will not help due to type erasure. As a matter of fact, compiler gives this warning:\r\n```\r\nWarning:(41, 18) non-variable type argument String in type pattern\r\n scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,String] (the underlying of Map[String,String])\r\n is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure\r\ncase mapArg: Map[String, String] =>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd 2 unit tests.","created_at":"2019-06-05T00:35:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:28:12Z","closed_at":"2019-06-10T19:03:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e448fae20454dc1154524585573fa752b01d097","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1055a220f5eb867d596f708f67a1c9f1c0385e2e","head":{"label":"jzhuge:SPARK-27947","ref":"SPARK-27947","sha":"1055a220f5eb867d596f708f67a1c9f1c0385e2e","user":{"login":"jzhuge","id":1883812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODM4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1883812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge","html_url":"https://github.com/jzhuge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102246817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyNDY4MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"jzhuge/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jzhuge","id":1883812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODM4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1883812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge","html_url":"https://github.com/jzhuge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jzhuge/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplements the `REPLACE TABLE` and `REPLACE TABLE AS SELECT` logical plans. `REPLACE TABLE` is now a valid operation in spark-sql provided that the tables being modified are managed by V2 catalogs.\r\n\r\nThis also introduces an atomic mix-in that table catalogs can choose to implement. Table catalogs can now implement `TransactionalTableCatalog`. The semantics of this API are that table creation and replacement can be \"staged\" and then \"committed\".\r\n\r\nOn the execution of `REPLACE TABLE AS SELECT`, `REPLACE TABLE`, and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, if the catalog implements transactional operations, the physical plan will use said functionality. Otherwise, these operations fall back on non-atomic variants. For `REPLACE TABLE` in particular, the usage of non-atomic operations can unfortunately lead to inconsistent state.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests - multiple additions to `DataSourceV2SQLSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T23:06:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T04:13:23Z","closed_at":"2019-07-22T04:13:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1aaa2d2b1f843bc4eef3381783e9944f50564a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/05a827df7094b07a492add875c6e649df52db41f","head":{"label":"palantir:spark-27724","ref":"spark-27724","sha":"05a827df7094b07a492add875c6e649df52db41f","user":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30919203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkxOTIwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"palantir/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn case of jvm errors the driver will not exit properly as there is no UnCaughtException handler. This causes issues when Spark is run in a container, as jvm will not exit due to still running threads, errors  are not propagated to K8s runtime and pods will run forever. This also makes impossible for the Spark Operator to report back a failed job.\r\nAs described in the related jira jvm errors may cause deadlocks and we cannot assume a healthy jvm\r\nto do a proper shutdown, so we avoid the registred shutdown hooks, it is the equivalent of setting `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`. For example the DAG event loop thread is a daemon thread and in the scenario described in the jira becomes unresponsive while the main thread also is stuck in the `runJob()` method waiting forever to make a job submission. However, this PR does not change the logic for the handler for the master, workers in standalone mode and the Spark executors. It only adds a special behavior for the driver where we exit immediately. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually by running a Spark Job.\r\nThis will make the job example in the jira fail and the container will exit with:\r\n```\r\nState:          Terminated\r\n  Reason:       Error\r\n  Exit Code:    52\r\n```","created_at":"2019-06-04T20:54:17Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T00:05:58Z","closed_at":"2019-12-29T00:05:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de9b611a1592a2d94911a7470e2f8d0fdafb8822","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the first part of [SPARK-27396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27396).  This is the minimum set of changes necessary to support a pluggable back end for columnar processing.  Follow on JIRAs would cover removing some of the duplication between functionality in this patch and functionality currently covered by things like ColumnarBatchScan.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added in a new unit test to cover new code not really covered in other places.\r\n\r\nI also did manual testing by implementing two plugins/extensions that take advantage of the new APIs to allow for columnar processing for some simple queries.  One version runs on the [CPU](https://gist.github.com/revans2/c3cad77075c4fa5d9d271308ee2f1b1d).  The other version run on a GPU, but because it has unreleased dependencies I will not include a link to it yet.\r\n\r\nThe CPU version I would expect to add in as an example with other documentation in a follow on JIRA\r\n\r\nThis is contributed on behalf of NVIDIA Corporation.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T18:03:08Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T13:01:35Z","closed_at":"2019-06-28T19:05:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9bcf546a3482d44cadb7156776f8de62ee33f1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24795/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24795/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24795/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f1753db2d15186399e5ef9d7ef88b2bc7eedf67","head":{"label":"revans2:columnar-basic","ref":"columnar-basic","sha":"7f1753db2d15186399e5ef9d7ef88b2bc7eedf67","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190236548,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTAyMzY1NDg=","name":"spark","full_name":"revans2/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/revans2/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Background**\r\nDefault constraint with column is ANSI standard.\r\nHive 3.0+ has supported default constraint ref:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18726\r\nBut Spark SQL implement this feature not yet.\r\n\r\n**Design**\r\nHive is widely used in production environments and is the standard in the field of big data in fact. \r\nBut Hive exists many version used in production and the feature between each version are different.\r\n\r\nSpark SQL need to implement default constraint, but there are three points to pay attention to in design:\r\nFirst, Spark SQL should reduce coupling with Hive. \r\nSecond, default constraint could compatible with different versions of Hive.\r\nThrid, Which expression of default constraint should Spark SQL support? I think should support `literal`, `current_date()`, `current_timestamp()`. Maybe other expression should also supported, like `Cast(1 as float)`, `1 + 2` and so on.\r\n\r\nWe want to save the metadata of default constraint into properties of Hive table, and then we restore metadata from the properties after client gets newest metadata.The implement is the same as other metadata (e.g. partition,bucket,statistics).\r\n\r\nBecause default constraint is part of column, so I think could reuse the metadata of StructField. The default constraint will cached by metadata of StructField.\r\n\r\n**Detail of this PR**\r\nThis is a sub task to implement default constraint.\r\nThis PR will solve the issue that save default constraint into properties of Hive table or data source table.\r\n\r\nThere exists some issue in this PR:\r\nFirst, how to check a number specified by somebody compliance with the accuracy and scope of the data type, like float, double.\r\nSecond, some code looks not very elegant, I hope to improve it with your suggestions.\r\n\r\n**Brother PR**\r\nThis PR is related to [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24372](24372). If this PR finish, unselected target column can be inserted into the default value, while running `insert into`.\r\nAfter this PR,  I will continue open other PR about default constraint, like alter table, desc table.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a minor documentation change whereby the https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-avro.html mentions \"The date type and naming of record fields should match the input Avro data or Catalyst data,\"\r\n\r\nThe term Catalyst data is confusing. It should instead say, Spark's internal data type such as String\r\nType or IntegerType.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\nThere are no code changes; only doc changes.\r\nPlease review https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change reverts the logic which was introduced as a part of SPARK-24149 and a subsequent followup PR. \r\n\r\nWith existing logic:\r\n- Spark fails to launch with HDFS federation enabled while trying to get a path to a logical nameservice.  \r\n- It gets tokens for unrelated namespaces if they are used in HDFS Federation\r\n- Automatic namespace discovery is supported only if these are on the same cluster.\r\n\r\nRationale for change:\r\n- For accessing data from related namespaces, viewfs should handle getting tokens for spark\r\n- For accessing data from unrelated namespaces(user explicitly specifies them using existing configs) as these could be on the same or different cluster.\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24365, we pass in the partitionBy columns as options in `DataFrameWriter`.  To make this change less intrusive for a patch release, we added a feature flag `LEGACY_PASS_PARTITION_BY_AS_OPTIONS` with the default to be false. \r\n\r\nFor 3.0, we should just do the correct behavior for DSV1, i.e., always passing partitionBy as options, and remove this legacy feature flag.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24068,  @IvanVergiliev reports that `OrcFilters.createBuilder` has exponential complexity in the height of the filter tree due to the way the check-and-build pattern is implemented. \r\nThis is because the same method `createBuilder` is called twice recursively for any children under `And`/`Or`/`Not` nodes, so that inside the first call, the second call is called as well(See description in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24068 for details).\r\n\r\nComparing to the  approach in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24068, I propose a very simple solution for the issue.  We can rely on the result of `convertibleFilters`, which can build a fully convertible tree. With it, we don't need to concern about the children of a certain node is not convertible in method `createBuilder`.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T17:40:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T16:00:46Z","closed_at":"2019-06-19T16:00:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74b4ea2ca79de6662b4771a147fdef8ba513f63e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/66d012bccfcb6ac70157519b19ded4038ee1195b","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:simplify_orc_filters","ref":"simplify_orc_filters","sha":"66d012bccfcb6ac70157519b19ded4038ee1195b","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for `ALTER TABLE REPLACE COLUMNS`\r\n- drop column if not preset in the new schema\r\n- add column if not preset in the table’s schema\r\n- keep column if `column.name` and `column.dataType` match between table and new schemas\r\n- raise exception if trying to replace an existing column with a different data type\r\n\r\nThis patch is inspired and mostly based on the work done by @xwu0226 in this PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16626\r\n\r\n#### PR highlights:\r\n- dropping columns is now allowed (b04f94a)\r\n- `AlterTableAddColumnsCommand` refactored to be more generic and support the implementation of `AlterTableReplaceColumnsCommand` (f8cbb96, 00f6376, da16d3e)\r\n- refactored how supported datasource formats for add and replace columns commands are validated (da16d3e)\r\n- implemented a `SchemaUtils` check to comparte two schemas and raise an exception if columns with the same name have different data types (8b6da23). This is based on the work done by @maropu here: f3dea60793d86212ba1068e88ad89cb3dcf07801, 647963a26a2d4468ebd9b68111ebe68bee501fde\r\n\r\n#### Known issues:\r\n- `AlterTableReplaceColumnsCommand` does not support CSV datasource format (13e3823)\r\n-  If a column is dropped, then re-added later with a different data type, this would be allowed but likely to fail when querying the table, depending on the datasource format and the data types used.\r\n-- However, this is actually not different from dropping the whole table and re-creating it with a schema that doesn’t match the underlying data. \r\n-- In any case, if the underlying data doesn't match the table metadata, issues are likely. Hive DDL documentation specifically warns about this possibility and remits the responsibility to ensure constancy between data and metadata the user : https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-Add/ReplaceColumns\r\n\r\n#### TODO:\r\n- agree on requirements and best approach\r\n- add tests for replacing comments\r\n- add tests for complex data types\r\n- add test for columns re-ordering\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- added tests cases\r\n- manually tested\r\n- run `testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Make sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Percentile receive frequency column as double.\r\n    1. Benefits\r\n        - This PR makes it possible to calculate percentile (linear interpolation over first argument in case of boundary), directly.\r\n        - It's possible to accept frequency argument of double type\r\n        - It's compatible with existing percentile function which used only integer as frequency\r\n    2. Use Case (Percentiles of Fractional Things)\r\n         - Problem: **We want to know the median price of water sold.** The unit of water is fractional, not integer.\r\n         - (Amount, Price) pairs: (2.13L, $1), (2.43L, $2), (2.1231L, $4)\r\n         - In this case, the median price of water is $2.\r\n         - **But existing API cannot get the median price of water of the problem, because the data type of frequency is integer, not floating number.**\r\n    \r\n2. **Reduce the number of binary searchs** for interpolation from two to one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting maven suites have been tested.(some tests have failed)\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pmesos -Pyarn -Pkubernetes -Dtest=none

-DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.PercentileSuite test\r\n```\r\n- Work In Progress\r\n    - (the unittest of the new option is not yet

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe new Spark ThriftServer SparkGetTablesOperation implemented in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22794 does a catalog.getTableMetadata request for every table. This can get very slow for large schemas (~50ms per table with an external Hive metastore).\r\nHive ThriftServer GetTablesOperation uses HiveMetastoreClient.getTableObjectsByName to get table

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf we want to keep corrupt record when reading CSV, we provide a new column into the schema, that is `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`. But this new column isn't actually a column in CSV header. So if `enforceSchema` is disabled, `CSVHeaderChecker` throws a exception complaining that number of column in CSV header isn't equal to that in the schema.\r\n\r\nThis backports the fix into branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fixes a problem where it is possible to create a v2 table using the default catalog that cannot be loaded with the session catalog. A session catalog should be used when the v1 catalog is responsible for tables with no catalog in the table identifier.\r\n\r\n* Adds a v2 catalog implementation that delegates to the analyzer's SessionCatalog\r\n* Uses the v2 session catalog for CTAS and CreateTable when the provider is a v2 provider and no v2 catalog is in the table identifier\r\n* Updates catalog lookup to always provide the default if it is set for consistent behavior\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Adds a new test suite for the v2 session catalog that validates the TableCatalog API\r\n* Adds test cases in PlanResolutionSuite to validate the v2 session catalog is used\r\n* Adds test suite for LookupCatalog with a default

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logical `Filter` operator to update its outputs' nullability when filter conditions imply that outputs cannot be null. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I refined similar existing logic in the physical `FilterExec` (changing the existing code to be more precise / less conservative in its non-nullability inference) and improved propagation of inferred nullability information in `Project`.\r\n\r\nThis is useful because of how it composes with other optimizations: Spark has several logical and physical optimizations which leverage non-nullability, so improving nullability inference increases the value of those existing optimizations.\r\n\r\n:warning: **Disclaimers** :warning:\r\n\r\n - This is a work-in-progress / skunkworks side project; I'm not working on this full time.\r\n - Nullability has been a major source of bugs in the past: this PR requires careful review.\r\n - I haven't run analyzer / optimizer performance benchmarks, so there's a decent chance that this WIP changeset regresses query planning performance.\r\n - DataFrames / Datasets / queries' `.schema` may change as a result of this optimization: this may have consequences in case nullability information is used by downstream systems (e.g. for `CREATE TABLE` DDL).\r\n - The schemas of analyzed and optimized logical plans may now differ in terms of field nullability (because optimization might infer additional constraints which allow us to prove that fields are non-null).\r\n \r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nConsider the query\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT key\r\nFROM t\r\nWHERE key IS NOT NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `t.key` is nullable.\r\n\r\nBecause of the `key IS NOT NULL` filter condition, `key` will always be non-null. Prior to this patch, this query's result schema was overly-conservative, continuing to mark  `key` as nullable. However, if we take advantage of the `key IS NOT NULL` condition we can set `nullable = false` for `key`.\r\n\r\nThis was a somewhat trivial example, so let's look at some more complicated cases:\r\n\r\nConsider \r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT A.key, A.value\r\nFROM A, B\r\nWHERE\r\n    A.key = B.key AND\r\n    (A.num + B.num) > 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere all columns of `A` and `B` are nullable. Because of the equality join condition, we know that `key` must be non-null in both tables. In addition, the condition `(A.num + B.num) > 0` can only hold if both `num` values are not null: addition is a _null-intolerant_ operator, meaning that it returns `null` if any of its operands is null.\r\n\r\nLeveraging this, we should be able to mark both `key` and `value` as non-null in the join result's schema (even though both values are nullable in the underlying input relation).\r\n\r\nFinally, let's look at an example of a **non** null-intolerant operator: `coalesce(a, b) IS NOT NULL` could still mean that `a` or `b` is null, so in\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT key, foo, COALESCE(foo, bar) as qux\r\nFROM A\r\nWHERE COALESCE(foo, bar) > 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can infer that `qux` is not null but cannot make any claims about `foo` or `bar`'s nullability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description of changes\r\n\r\n- Introduce `PredicateHelper.getImpliedNotNullExprIds(IsNotNull)` helper, which takes an `IsNotNull` expression and returns the `ExprId`s of expressions which cannot be null. This handles simple cases like `IsNotNull(columnFromTable)`, as well as more complex cases involving expression trees (properly accounting for null-(in)tolerance).\r\n  - There was similar existing logic in `FilterExec`, but I think it was overly conservative: given `IsNotNull(x)`, it would claim that `x` _and all of its descendants_ were not null if and only if every ancestor of `x` was `NullIntolerant`. However, even if `x` is null-tolerant we can still make claims about `x`'s non-nullability even if we can't make further claims about its children.\r\n- Update `logical.Filter` to leverage this new function to update output nullability.\r\n- Modify `FilterExec` to re-use this logic. This part is a bit tricky because the `FilterExec` code looks at `IsNotNull` expressions both for optimizing the order of expression evaluation _and_ for refining nullability to elide null checks in downstream operators.\r\n- Modify `logical.Project` so that inferred non-nullability information from child operators is preserved.\r\n \r\n### Background on related historical changes / bugs\r\n\r\nWhile developing this patch, I found the following historical PRs to be useful references (note: many of these original PRs contained correctness bugs which were subsequently fixed in later PRs):\r\n\r\n- #10844 first introduced constraint inference and propagation in Spark SQL (including basic extraction of `IsNotNull` conditions from expressions).\r\n- #11585 modified `FilterExec` to update output nullability based on `IsNotNull` conditions.\r\n- #11792 modified `FilterExec` to add special handling for `IsNotNull` expression codegen, altering evaluation order to allow for better short-circuiting.\r\n- #11809 introduced the `NullIntolerant` trait to generalize the `IsNotNull` extraction logic.\r\n- #11810 updates `FilterExec`'s `IsNotNull`-handling path to use `NullIntolerant`\r\n- #15523 fixed a bug in `FilterExec`'s logic: it did not properly account for null-tolerant operators which were ancestors of `IsNotNull` expressions.\r\n- #16067 fixed a bug

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis updates CTE substitution to avoid needing to run all resolution rules on each substituted expression. Running resolution rules was previously used to avoid infinite recursion. In the updated rule, CTE plans are substituted as sub-queries from right to left. Using this scope-based order, it is not necessary to replace multiple CTEs at the same time using `resolveOperatorsDown`. Instead, `resolveOperatorsUp` is used to replace each CTE individually.\r\n\r\nBy resolving using `resolveOperatorsUp`, this no longer needs to run all analyzer rules on each substituted expression. Previously, this was done to apply `ResolveRelations`, which would throw an `AnalysisException` for all unresolved relations so that unresolved relations that may cause recursive substitutions were not left in the plan. Because this is no longer needed, `ResolveRelations` no longer needs to throw `AnalysisException` and resolution can be done in multiple rules.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests in `SQLQueryTestSuite`, `cte.sql`.","created_at":"2019-05-31T20:43:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:28:50Z","closed_at":"2019-06-04T21:50:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d3ba43098145d7cdd48ea2a872dda2882b226e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ae409d3d4bfc2d617814f0b4eb923b7d84f8854","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-27909-fix-cte-substitution","ref":"SPARK-27909-fix-cte-substitution","sha":"6ae409d3d4bfc2d617814f0b4eb923b7d84f8854","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd's the higher order function `forall`, which tests an array to see if a predicate holds for every element.\r\nThe function is implemented in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ArrayForAll`.\r\nThe function is added to the function registry under the pretty name `forall`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've added appropriate unit tests for the new ArrayForAll expression in\r\n`sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/HigherOrderFunctionsSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\nAlso added tests for the function in `sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameFunctionsSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\nNot sure who is best to ask about this PR so:\r\n @HyukjinKwon @rxin @gatorsmile @ueshin @srowen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims at improving the way physical plans are explained in spark.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the explain output for physical plan may look very cluttered and each operator's\r\nstring representation can be very wide and wraps around in the display making it little\r\nhard to follow. This especially happens when explaining a query 1) Operating on wide tables\r\n2) Has complex expressions etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to split the output into two sections. In the header section, we display\r\nthe basic operator tree with a number associated with each operator. In this section, we strictly\r\ncontrol what we output for each operator. In the footer section, each operator is verbosely\r\ndisplayed. Based on the feedback from Maryann, the uncorrelated subqueries (SubqueryExecs) are not included in the main plan. They are printed separately after the main plan and can be\r\ncorrelated by the originating expression id from its parent plan.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, here is a simple plan displayed in old vs new way.\r\n\r\nExample query1 :\r\n```\r\nEXPLAIN SELECT key, Max(val) FROM explain_temp1 WHERE key > 0 GROUP BY key HAVING max(val) > 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOld :\r\n```\r\n*(2) Project [key#2,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf we want to keep corrupt record when reading CSV, we provide a new column into the schema, that is `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`. But this new column isn't actually a column in CSV header. So if `enforceSchema` is disabled, `CSVHeaderChecker` throws a exception complaining that number of column in CSV header isn't equal to that in the schema.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to add an integrated test base for various UDF test cases so that Scalar UDF, Python UDF and Scalar Pandas UDFs can be tested in SBT & Maven tests.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nOne of the problems we face is that: `ExtractPythonUDFs` (for Python UDF and Scalar Pandas UDF) has unevaluable expressions that always has to be wrapped with special plans. This special rule seems producing many issues, for instance, SPARK-27803, SPARK-26147, SPARK-26864, SPARK-26293, SPARK-25314 and SPARK-24721.\r\n\r\n### Why do we have less test cases dedicated for SQL and plans with Python UDFs?\r\n\r\nWe have virtually no such SQL (or plan) dedicated tests in PySpark to catch such issues because: \r\n  - A developer should know all the analyzer, the optimizer, SQL, PySpark, Py4J and version differences in Python to write such good test cases\r\n  - To test plans, we should access to plans in JVM via Py4J which is tricky, messy and duplicates Scala test cases\r\n  - Usually we just add end-to-end test cases in PySpark therefore there are not so many dedicated examples to refer to write in PySpark\r\n\r\nIt is also a non-trivial overhead to switch test base and method between Python and Scala (IMHO).\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Python UDF and Scalar Pandas UDF into our `*.sql` file based test base in runtime of SBT / Maven test cases. It generates Python-pickled instance (consisting of return type and Python native function) that is used in Python or Scalar Pandas UDF and directly brings into JVM.\r\n\r\nAfter that, (we don't interact via Py4J) run the tests directly in JVM - we can just register and run Python UDF and Scalar Pandas UDF in JVM.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I only integrated this change into SQL file based testing. This is how works with test files under `udf` directory:\r\n\r\nAfter the test files under 'inputs/udf' directory are detected, it creates three test cases:\r\n  - Scala UDF test case with a Scalar UDF registered named 'udf'.\r\n  - Python UDF test case with a Python UDF registered named 'udf' iff Python executable and pyspark are available.\r\n  - Scalar Pandas UDF test case with a Scalar Pandas UDF registered named 'udf' iff Python executable, pandas, pyspark and pyarrow are available.\r\n\r\nTherefore, UDF test cases should have single input and output files but executed by three different types of UDFs.\r\n\r\nFor instance, \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW ta AS\r\nSELECT udf(a) AS a, udf('a') AS tag FROM t1\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT udf(a) AS a, udf('b') AS tag FROM t2;\r\n\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW tb AS\r\nSELECT udf(a) AS a, udf('a') AS tag FROM t3\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT udf(a) AS a, udf('b') AS tag FROM t4;\r\n\r\nSELECT tb.* FROM ta INNER JOIN tb ON ta.a = tb.a AND ta.tag = tb.tag;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be ran 3 times with Scalar UDF, Python UDF and Scalar Pandas UDF each.\r\n\r\n### Appendix\r\n\r\nPlus, this PR adds `IntegratedUDFTestUtils` which enables to test and execute Python UDF and Scalar Pandas UDFs as below:\r\n\r\nTo register Python UDF in SQL:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nIntegratedUDFTestUtils.registerTestUDF(TestPythonUDF(name = \"udf\"), spark)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo register Scalar Pandas UDF in SQL:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nIntegratedUDFTestUtils.registerTestUDF(TestScalarPandasUDF(name = \"udf\"), spark)\r\n```\r\n\r\n To use it in Scala API:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.select(expr(\"udf(1)\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n To use it in SQL:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"SELECT udf(1)\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis util could be used in the future for better coverage with Scala API combinations as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested via the command below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test-only *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z udf/udf-inner-join.sql\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] SQLQueryTestSuite:\r\n[info] - udf/udf-inner-join.sql - Scala UDF (5 seconds, 47 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - udf/udf-inner-join.sql - Python UDF (4 seconds, 335 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - udf/udf-inner-join.sql - Scalar Pandas UDF (5 seconds, 423 milliseconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[python] unavailable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] SQLQueryTestSuite:\r\n[info] - udf/udf-inner-join.sql - Scala UDF (4 seconds, 577 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - udf/udf-inner-join.sql - Python UDF is skipped because [pyton] and/or pyspark were not available. !!!

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent SQL parser's error message for hyphen-connected identifiers without surrounding backquotes(e.g. hyphen-table) is confusing for end users. A possible approach to tackle this is to explicitly capture these wrong usages in the SQL parser. In this way, the end users can fix these errors more quickly.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a simple query such as `SELECT * FROM test-table`, the original error message is\r\n```\r\nError in SQL statement: ParseException: \r\nmismatched input '-' expecting <EOF>(line 1, pos 18)\r\n```\r\nwhich can be confusing in a large query.\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, the error message is:\r\n```\r\nError in query:\r\nPossibly unquoted identifier test-table detected. Please consider quoting it with back-quotes as `test-table`(line 1, pos 14)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSELECT * FROM test-table\r\n--------------^^^\r\n```\r\nwhich is easier for end users to identify the issue and fix.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe safely augmented the current grammar rule to explicitly capture these error cases. The error handling logic is implemented in the SQL parsing listener `PostProcessor`.\r\n\r\nHowever, note that for cases such as `a - my-func(b)`, the parser can't actually tell whether this should be ``a -`my-func`(b) `` or `a - my - func(b)`. Therefore for these cases, we leave the parser as is. Also, in this patch we only provide better error messages for character-only identifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdding new unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T22:59:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T06:54:18Z","closed_at":"2019-06-19T04:55:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45bd3bae79d2d7354c0ce279517b946321da3866","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1996b8bc7aaa3dcaac61a3c93d904a9ef2ce696","head":{"label":"yeshengm:hyphen-ident","ref":"hyphen-ident","sha":"e1996b8bc7aaa3dcaac61a3c93d904a9ef2ce696","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current `SQLTestUtils` created many `withXXX` utility functions to clean up tables/views/caches created for testing purpose. This PR standardizes those 'withXXX' function to use`Utils.tryWithSafeFinally` function. This function executes a block of code, then a finally block.  If exceptions happen in the finally block, this function does not suppress the original exception.\r\n   \r\nThe purpose of this proposal is to help developers to identify what actually breaks their tests. For example, the below test should fail with a `ParserException`. However, without this patch, the `NullPointerException` throwing from finally block suppresses the true exception `ParserException`\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest(\"SPARK-27772\") {\r\n    spark.range(1,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current `SQLTestUtils` created many `withXXX` utility functions to clean up tables/views/caches created for testing purpose. Some of those `withXXX` functions ignore certain exceptions, like `NoSuchTableException` in the clean up block (ie, the finally block). \r\n \r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Drops temporary view `viewNames` after calling `f`.\r\n */\r\nprotected def withTempView(viewNames: String*)(f: => Unit): Unit = {\r\n  try f finally {\r\n    // If the test failed part way, we don't want to mask the failure by failing to remove\r\n    // temp views that never got created.\r\n    try viewNames.foreach(spark.catalog.dropTempView) catch {\r\n      case _: NoSuchTableException =>\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it is not the best approach. Because it is hard to anticipate what exception should or should not be ignored.  \r\n\r\nJava's `try-with-resources` statement does not mask exception throwing in the try block with any exception caught in the 'close()' statement. Exception caught in the 'close()' statement would add as a suppressed exception instead. It sounds a better approach.  \r\n \r\nTherefore, I proposed to standardise those 'withXXX' function with following `tryWithFinally` function, which does something similar to Java's try-with-resources statement. \r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n* Drops temporary view `viewNames` after calling `f`.\r\n*/\r\nprotected def withTempView(viewNames: String*)(f: => Unit): Unit = {\r\n  tryWithFinally(f)(viewNames.foreach(spark.catalog.dropTempView))\r\n}\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Executes the given tryBlock and then the given finallyBlock no matter whether tryBlock throws\r\n   * an exception. If both tryBlock and finallyBlock throw exceptions, the exception thrown\r\n   * from the finallyBlock with be added to the exception thrown from tryBlock as a\r\n   * suppress exception. It helps to avoid masking the exception from tryBlock with exception\r\n   * from finallyBlock\r\n   */\r\n  private def tryWithFinally(tryBlock: => Unit)(finallyBlock: => Unit): Unit = {\r\n    var fromTryBlock: Throwable = null\r\n    try tryBlock catch {\r\n      case cause: Throwable =>\r\n        fromTryBlock = cause\r\n        throw cause\r\n    } finally {\r\n      if (fromTryBlock != null) {\r\n        try finallyBlock catch {\r\n          case fromFinallyBlock: Throwable =>\r\n            fromTryBlock.addSuppressed(fromFinallyBlock)\r\n            throw fromTryBlock\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        finallyBlock\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a feature is well written, we show not hit any exception in those closing method in testcase. The purpose of this proposal is to help developers to identify what actually break their tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nA unit test is added to make sure those withXXX (eg withCache) methods would not mask the original exception.
