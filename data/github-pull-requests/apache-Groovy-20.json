factory.\n","created_at":"2016-01-01T21:31:06Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T00:09:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T00:07:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8c48cfb1ac85143d621c6b4b73208ec90145cfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/58c88530119f65088b2570c8e8a6203aa91aa16b","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:GROOVY-7150","ref":"GROOVY-7150","sha":"58c88530119f65088b2570c8e8a6203aa91aa16b","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror

to PR #219, this removes unused ThreadLocal caching from ClassInfo.  Because the `localMapRef` ThreadLocal field was wrapped in a `WeakReference` and nothing else ever references the referent ThreadLocalMapHandler object, I believe the `localMapRef` reference likely always returned `null` causing delegation to the global cache.  In addition, nothing was ever inserted into the LocalMap held by the ThreadLocal so it basically would always just return values from the `globalClassValue/Set`.\n","created_at":"2015-12-23T04:45:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-25T02:49:11Z","closed_at":"2015-12-25T02:44:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ed79bc79d7dbe84677110c6c6a038874b926c8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/0cf3fff74d516f4cb31688141ceb81931c29bef8","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:classinfo-threadlocalmap","ref":"classinfo-threadlocalmap","sha":"0cf3fff74d516f4cb31688141ceb81931c29bef8","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror

duplication.\n","created_at":"2015-11-15T19:12:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-21T17:39:54Z","closed_at":"2015-12-21T17:37:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"302aa9ae9c188ff80323c4653399d9e7c38aeb37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/3e223f7c7489a22edf13da6d1610c98dea3136c9","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:GROOVY-7630","ref":"GROOVY-7630","sha":"3e223f7c7489a22edf13da6d1610c98dea3136c9","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror

looking into some other issues I noticed quite a few unused methods in the `CharScanner` class.  Even though the class and it's methods are public, since it's in an `internal` named package it seems that it would be ok to treat it as non-public facing API ([I asked on the dev list](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-groovy-dev/201511.mbox/%3CCAJ2HCd-ZcuZ%2BD6WUjjVAat8thEmibzW-9y1MchPz3cRR-yVdJg%40mail.gmail.com%3E)).  \n\nChanges:\n1. Removed all methods (and those that were left unused after their removal) that were not referenced anywhere in the entire project or were only referenced in the `CharScannerTest` class as the method under test.\n2. Removed unused class variables\n3. Removed duplicate code in `parseIntFromTo`, both branches of `if` had same code\n4. Added additional tests for `parseIntFromTo` to make sure changes above were ok\n5. Removed unneeded `final` modifier from static method\n6. Removed `== true` in boolean checks\n7. Removed one and only call to `#parseBigDecimal(char[], int, int)` in order to remove it since was only referenced in same class and `BigDecimal` constructor offers the same signature.\n\nBesides ensuring a `./gradlew clean test` passed I also did some testing against various large json payloads (https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy-json-tests) to make they all parsed successfully.\n\nI know it's a lot of change (deletions) but wanted to offer the PR for
