PR contains some clean-up work following the first phase of porting apache beam to Python 3.\r\n\r\n- **Remove six dependency**\r\nWhen starting the porting work, we decided to use the future package instead of the six package, since it allows us to port our code forward instead of back. This should simplify the future addition of Python 3 code and the refactoring if Python 2 support would ever be dropped.\r\n\r\n- **Run py2to3 pylint on apache_beam module**\r\nDuring porting, the list of modules to run this test on was extended with every ported module. Now that the phase has finished, we can run it on the whole apache_beam module.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR rolls up https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/5809 and runs website builds and tests inside a Docker container.\r\n\r\nDescription of #5809:\r\n\r\n> This adds a new pre-commit job for the website sources in the apache/beam repo. This is a step in the migration effort to move website sources into the main repo and improve automation reliability. See: https://s.apache.org/beam-site-automation\r\n> \r\n> Note that this change doesn't cover automatic staging of the repository. I'll work on that in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nRunning the jobs in a container has these advantages:\r\n\r\n- Consistency of environment: minimal differences between local dev machine and Jenkins.\r\n- Using an existing Ruby container minimizes automation effort and build time.\r\n- No need to install Jekyll and other website dependencies locally.\r\n\r\nI investigated the following ways of running precommit and postcommit website jobs using Docker.\r\n\r\n1. https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-custom-build-environment\r\nThis plugin has been installed in builds.apache.org's Jenkins service. I couldn't test it locally however, and I wouldn't expect developers working on Jenkins jobs to go through the hassle of Installing and configuring Jenkins on their local machine or VM. I tried using the dockerized-jenkins (in this repo), and while I managed to configure and launch the jobs with the plugin, I still came across the issue of running [docker-in-docker](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/). I opted for the solution of running jobs as sibling containers (of the Jenkins container), but the plugin wants to bind mount the repo and /tmp directories to the job container and that doesn't seem to work.\r\n1. https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin\r\nI tried this plugin hoping to make managing Docker containers simpler, but it seems to be aimed more at building and publishing images. For instance I was missing the -u flag for docker create.\r\n1. Calling docker CLI directly.\r\nThis is what I settled on. It should work very similarly on dev and Jenkins machines.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR fixes the flakiness in some ES tests: \r\n- in testRead() index contains more data than inserted\r\n- in testWrite() connection timeout to embedded Elasticsearch 2.4.\r\n\r\nEvery flakiness issue is tackled in one specific commit. IMHO for the sake of history isolation they should not be squashed.\r\nR: @timrobertson100\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

starts the Job Server in a container when Python pipelines are run and no\r\nJob Server endpoint has been specified. The Job Server has the docker binaries\r\nand socket mounted from the host to bring up SDK harness containers directly on\r\nthe host. This feature is currently only is available for Flink.\r\n\r\nDue to host networking not being available on MacOs, we need to explicitly map\r\nports from the host system to the container. On Linux this is not necessary\r\nbecause host networking works as expected. Generally, getting Docker support to\r\nwork on MacOs proved to be a bit tricky.\r\n\r\nYou can test this via:\r\n\r\n```\r\n gradle :beam-sdks-python:portableWordCount\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome rough edges on MacOS:\r\n\r\n- At times, the JobService socket is not available, even though `grpc.channel_ready_future(channel).result()` in the portable_runner returns. \r\n=> I had to implement a retry logic for the first request.\r\n- The port range for the SDK harness is restricted to be between 8100 and 8200 (configurable) due to the necessary explicit port forwarding\r\n\r\nPotentially problematic on Linux:\r\n\r\n- The Docker binary might not be statically compiled and depend on shared\r\n  libraries, though this needs to be tested\r\n\r\nCC @angoenka \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

some typos which slipped in to the original Kudu commit in error and meant the kudu testWrite() was not doing what it was intended to do. \r\n\r\n1) It has gone unnoticed presumably because test environments have had more than 3 processor cores. The intended design was to ensure only at least 3 which is the minimum parallelism that the DirectRunner will provide. \r\n\r\n2) The second loop here was just a typo and never executed. This corrects that to verify behaviour.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR enables running IOIT on Spark runner. One can do that by setting up remote spark cluster (spark master) and running this command: \r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew clean integrationTest -p sdks/java/io/file-based-io-tests/ -DintegrationTestPipelineOptions='[\"--numberOfRecords=1000\", \"--filenamePrefix=PREFIX\", \"--runner=TestSparkRunner\", \"--sparkMaster=spark://LGs-Mac.local:7077\", \"--tempLocation=/tmp/\"]' -DintegrationTestRunner=spark --tests org.apache.beam.sdk.io.text.TextIOIT --info\r\n```\r\n\r\nI experienced some difficulties with TFRecordIOIT, ParquetIOIT and XmlIOIT tests: \r\n - XmlIOIT fails on assertion (hashcode of PCollection is different that it should be)\r\n - ParquetIOIT suffers for dependency missmatch (`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetWriter$Builder.<init>(Lorg/apache/parquet/io/OutputFile;)V`)\r\n - TFRecordIOIT cannot find the created file: `java.io.FileNotFoundException: No files found for spec: PREFIX_1534520885787*`\r\n\r\nThose issues are of different nature than the one described in BEAM-3371 and have to be tackled separately. \r\n\r\n@iemejia Could you take a look when you're back? There's no need to rush - I'll be off for 2 weeks now. \r\n\r\nCC: @pabloem \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

for streaming side inputs. Please note:\r\n\r\n* Currently only tested with iterable access pattern using Python (flinkCompatibilityMatrixStreaming passes). Unit test for side input handler factory should be added.\r\n* Due to the existing support classes side inputs are identified with PCollectionView. While working on it I realized that we can probably get rid of most PCollectionView usages from the DoFnOperator since it is really just a wrapper around the string ID.\r\n* It should be possible (in the future) to refactor the DoFnOperator to separate out everything that is common between old and new runner into a new base class (state and side input handling) and pull up the \"DoFnRunner\" business into a subclass. There are subtle aspects in how state, timers and side inputs are handled correctly that should not be duplicated but also not mingled with legacy code going forward. \r\n* `FlinkExecutableStageContext` assumed that a state handler can be constructed just based on RuntimeContext (and ExecutableStage). That worked for batch when using broadcast variables. But here we need a side input handler that is supplied by the operator. Untangled state request handler construction from the context. It turns out that override in unit tests can be accomplished in simpler manner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

 tests of Floor and Ceil functions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a bug for Floor and Ceil where Floor and Ceil convert some primitive types (e.g. int) to Double but the code [BeamCalcRel](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rel/BeamCalcRel.java#L127) still generates a ROW with initial schema (e.g. int32), so Row verification will fail because of mismatch between, for example, INT32 type and Double value. Add a `@Ingore` with created [bug JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5128) to the unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.
