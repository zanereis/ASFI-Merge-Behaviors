the DB/NonDB tests were introduced (#35160) new test types have been added (separating various Python test types from generic Operator test type). However we have not added matching of the python operator and test files into the right selective unit test type. This caused that when only `operators/python.py` and `tests/test_python` were changed, then `Operators` test type was run but the specific Python * test types were not run.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it for current test type (including also separated Serialization test type) and for the future - instead of matching selected test type we match all of them except the few that we now are \"special\" (\"Always, Core, Other, PlainAsserts\").\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36128\r\n\r\nThis PR contains both an updated ``airflow roles export`` and ``airflow roles import`` cli command, according to the above mentioned issue. \r\n\r\nThe export command now exports resources and actions by default in the following structure:\r\n```\r\n[{\"name\": \"FakeTeamA\", \"resource\": \"Pools\", \"action\": \"can_edit,can_read\"}, \r\n {\"name\": \"FakeTeamA\", \"resource\": \"Admin\", \"action\": \",menu_access\"}, \r\n{\"name\": \"FakeTeamB\", \"resource\": \"\", \"action\": \"\"}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n- When a role has no permissions the values for the respective keys are set to empty Strings. \r\nThis way the import function can later easily distinguish if the imported role needs permissions to be set or not\r\n\r\n- @potiuk I originally mentioned that we could use the ``-p`` flag to say whether we want to export names and permissions or just the names. However the function already uses the ``-p`` flag (--pretty) thus I believe this will not work. That's why the function currently also exports permissions by default. \r\n\r\n- Previously the ``-p`` flag sorted the list of names in alphabetical order and set the indent to 4 . However with the function now returning a list of dictionaries, I disabled the sorting if ``-p``is set, because in this case the order of the keys would be switched. \r\n\r\nThe ``airflow roles import`` commands expect the json to be in the same structure as the exported one. In it I have reused the ``__roles_add_or_remove_permissions``which was already contained in the file and handles the logic for adding permissions. \r\n\r\n- to pass args to __roles_add_or_remove_permissions from the imported json, I used Namespace from argparse. argparse is already a dependency of airflow. \r\n\r\n- In the beginning, I remove all roles that are already contained within the db from the json. By this I can ensure that only new roles are being added. Due to the structure of the json, role names are contained multiple time with different resources, thus I need to check for each dictionary, whether the role has been already added and thus I only need to add the permissions within this dictionary or a new role needs to be created. \r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to test the new functions. \r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

docs building happens insid of the container image and code doing that sits in `docs` folder, while publishing has already been moved to `breeze` code (and is executed in the Breeze venv, not in the container). Both building and publishing code were present in both (copy&pasted) and the parts of it not relevant to the `other` function has not been used.\r\n\r\nWhile eventually we will move docs building also to `breeze` the first step of that is to remove the redundancy and clean-up unused code, so that we can make the transition cleaner.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the Python operator how-to guide, there are doc admonitions that don't necessarily reflect the sentiment of the call-out. For example, there are several places where there is a recommendation to use the TaskFlow version of an operator, but the admonition is a warning; this is more of a tip when authoring DAGs.\r\n\r\nThis PR hopes to match the sentiment of the call-out with an \"appropriate\" admonition for better context and visibility when reading the

running docs building with --spellcheck-only and building docs fails, the errors which were not spelling errors were not handled well - first of all, the build errors were not printted separately as errors (you only saw generaic spellchecking failed), but more importantly, when building docs failed it has not been repeated again. This caused problems if there were changes that required to rebuild another packag - which happens when you add related changes to several packages.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by:\r\n\r\n* allowing spellchecking to contribute build errors when the --spellcheck-only flag is used\r\n\r\n* when build is retried, spellcheck-only flag is ignored - so that the documentation for related packages can be actually rebuilt, not only spell-checked\r\n\r\n* when --spellcheck-only is used to build packages, all original packages are rebuilt not only the failed one - this allows to rebuild dependent packages\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we are getting more diagrams generated in Airflow using the \"diagram as a code\" approach, this PR improves the pre-commit to be more suitable to support generation of more of the images coming from different sources, placed in different directories and generated independently, so that the whole process is more distributed and easy for whoever creates diagrams to add their own diagram.\r\n\r\nThe changes implemented in this PR:\r\n\r\n* the code to generate the diagrams is now next to the diagram they generate. It has the same name as the diagram, but it has the .py extension. This way it is immediately visible where is the source of each diagram (right next to each diagram)\r\n\r\n* each of the .py diagram Python files is runnable on its own. This way you can easily regenerate the diagrams by running corresponding Python file or even automate it by running \"save\" action and generate the diagrams automatically by running the Python code every time the file is saved. That makes a very nice workflow on iterating on each diagram, independently from each othere\r\n\r\n* the pre-commit script is given a set of folders which should be scanned and it finds and run the diagrams on pre-commmit. It also creates and verifies the md5sum hash of the source Python file separately for each diagram and only runs diagram generation when the source file changed vs. last time the hash was saved and committed. The hash sum is stored next to the image and sources with .md5sum extension\r\n\r\nAlso updated documentation in the CONTRIBUTING.rst explaining how to generate the diagrams and what is the mechanism of that generation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMy aim is to to create a documentation page clearly indicating which Operators and Hooks are supporting OpenLineage.\r\n\r\nI made a separate module for custom code specific to providers and included it as a Sphinx extension in the documentation build for provider packages. Then, i added a single page with supported classes in the OpenLineage provider docs.\r\n\r\n**The primary challenge is inheritance analysis**: If an operator support OpenLineage, it means it has some specific methods implemented. These methods could be implemented directly in the operator, or in a parent class, which might not necessarily be an operator itself (for example, `airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery._BigQueryOpenLineageMixin`).\r\n\r\n**Solution**: To identify if a class or its ancestors implement OpenLineage methods, we plan to analyze all provider modules statically (without importing them). This involves gathering data on all classes (names, methods, parent classes, etc.) into a dictionary. Using this data, we can quite accurately reconstruct the class inheritance hierarchy and pinpoint classes with the required OpenLineage methods.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` that utilizes SQL parsing for lineage extraction from queries. In that case, extracting unique information from different database types requires the use of a dedicated Hook equipped with OpenLineage methods. We'll utilize the same class registry to identify hook-specific methods but we'll present this information distinctly on the documentation page.\r\n\r\nNote: Some Core Operators like Bash and Python are currently supported by OpenLineage Extractors, not by methods within the Operator. As this is an exception and there will be no more operators handled this way, we're not scanning core Airflow modules for now and are manually adding this information to the documentation.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n1. **Globally unique class names** - when building the class registry, we operate under the assumption that class names are globally unique, although this may not always be the case. When encountering duplicate class names, the registry will only retain one instance per name. While there are potential solutions to address this issue, maintaining simplicity in identifying inheritance is a priority. In my view, accepting some level of error might be a reasonable trade-off. However, I'm open to suggestions if you have alternative ideas or improvements.\r\n2. **Accepting Limitations** - Currently predicting every possible scenario isn't feasible, so there's a chance that some implementations might go undetected or be incorrectly represented with our current approach. My aim is to closely monitor this document as OpenLineage support expands and respond proactively to any emerging issues.\r\n\r\nTaking all of this into account, I still think it's a good idea to create a list of operators supported by OpenLineage. It might not be perfect, but it's a good starting point and should help make using OpenLineage easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

param _request_timeout is not provided, the default is no timeout, which means that sometimes a log read through the kubernetes API may hang forever.

Generally this should not cause a problem because it will be after a read timeout.  We might occasionally lose a couple log lines after a connection timeout.  But I don't think it's worth the complexity to avoid that.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-19T06:19:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T13:56:05Z","closed_at":"2023-12-22T13:56:05Z","merged_at":"2023-12-22T13:56:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"33ee0b98b2731ecdb27fc67d33e121948dd63c68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pankajkoti","id":10206082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10206082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti","html_url":"https://github.com/pankajkoti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajkoti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pankajastro","id":98807258,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeOt2g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98807258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro","html_url":"https://github.com/pankajastro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pankajastro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes

#35812 \r\n\r\nI have made the necessary changes to the docker-compose.yaml file as proposed within the issue. The relevant line is currently outcommented, but the documentation in the index.rst and comments above the outcommented line tell users \r\nwhat to do. If one deletes the comment, an airflow.cfg file within ``${AIRFLOW_PROJ_DIR:-.}``  is now added to ``/opt/airflow/airflow.cfg``within the containers, once ``docker compose up``has been executed. The new line also should make it clear where the airflow.cfg is stored in the containers, as brought up by the issue. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned, I also added documentation for the changes in the index.rst file, such that users know how to automatically ingest their own airflow.cfg upon startup. \r\n\r\n@potiuk Can you maybe have a look at this, since you also approved the original issue? \r\n\r\nIf I should change anything please let me know :) \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

generated dependencies are not properly updated, we had a special step where the dependencies were generated \"just in case\" before CI image was built, because otherwise building the CI image could have failed with strange \"failed because of conflicting dependencies\" without a clue what was the root cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pre-commit did not return error exit code - because for the pre-commit, it is enough that a file is modified during pre-commit to fail the pre-commit in general.\r\n\r\nThat had a nasty side effect because the built CI image actually already contained properly generated dependencies (by this step), and it did not properly detected cases where the ones in the repository were added manually and not generated with pre-commit.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it - instead of generating and building such image in CI it will now fail the CI image building step but with clear instructions what to do.\r\n\r\nThe CI job step uses now regular breeze command rather than running the script manually but also the script returns error code in case the generated dependencies have been updated.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n

generated dependencies are not properly updated, we had a special step where the dependencies were generated \"just in case\" before CI image was built, because otherwise building the CI image could have failed with strange \"failed because of conflicting dependencies\" without a clue what was the root cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pre-commit did not return error exit code - because for the pre-commit, it is enough that a file is modified during pre-commit to fail the pre-commit in general.\r\n\r\nThat had a nasty side effect because the built CI image actually already contained properly generated dependencies (by this step), and it did not properly detected cases where the ones in the repository were added manually and not generated with pre-commit.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it - instead of generating and building such image in CI it will now fail the CI image building step but with clear instructions what to do.\r\n\r\nThe CI job step uses now regular breeze command rather than running the script manually but also the script returns error code in case the generated dependencies have been updated.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n

pendulum 2 for a while, even if it has some problem it might help users to migrate to pendulum 3.\r\n\r\nAdd `--downgrade-pendulum` by the same way as it implements into the `--downgrade-sqlalchemy` so we could also run tests against pendulum 2 for a while.\r\n\r\nThe only one version of pendulum supported - `2.1.2` with older versions such as `2.0.0` I had a problem with initialised Airflow, there is should not be a big problem because we have `2.1.2` for a long period of time in constraints, and I guess for all Airflow 2.x but I do not checked all constraints only latests.\r\n\r\n# There

we are installing a released version of Airflow in Breeze, we can pass additional extras to install (For example, we need to pass celery extra in order to start airflow with celery executor.\r\n\r\nThe extras could be specified as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbreeze start-airflow --use-airflow-version 2.8.0rc4  \\\r\n  --executor CeleryExecutor --airflow-extras \"celery\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever recent refactors caused a problem that the extras added were specified after version (which is rejected by newer versions of `pip`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it and also moves the place where CeleryExecutor use triggers adding celery extra when`--use-airflow-version` is used.\r\n\r\nThe warning about this is better visible when moving to Shell

As suggested in the linked issue, if a Python `dict` is returned it is recommended that if any of the dict's values are False-y , then the Operator should fail. This PR makes that change.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the SQL query being tested returns:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n{'DUPLICATE_ID_CHECK': False, 'NULL_VALUES_CHECK': True}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the operator should return False, since there is a Falsy value present.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds an additional unit test and updated the documentation of the Operator.\r\n\r\n**Question for reviewers**: I am concerned that users may be implementing this operator under the assumption that any `dict` returned means the task should pass. With this change, that would now lead to the task failing.\r\n\r\n---","created_at":"2023-12-18T01:39:38Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T17:33:26Z","closed_at":"2023-12-19T23:43:07Z","merged_at":"2023-12-19T23:43:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c1d8f40a10b3e0beb1cae70d301fe704e64ab0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4357710723,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABA71jgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:common-sql","name":"provider:common-sql","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/36273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/36273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/36273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cc125ac5ab11d393e83eabb8ee27119b31834ff4","head":{"label":"spencertollefson:sql-check-operator-fail-on-false-dict-values","ref":"sql-check-operator-fail-on-false-dict-values","sha":"cc125ac5ab11d393e83eabb8ee27119b31834ff4","user":{"login":"spencertollefson","id":22157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU3MTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson","html_url":"https://github.com/spencertollefson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":694762756,"node_id":"R_kgDOKWk9BA","name":"airflow","full_name":"spencertollefson/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"spencertollefson","id":22157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU3MTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson","html_url":"https://github.com/spencertollefson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencertollefson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/spencertollefson/airflow","description":"Apache

were few small problems in release process:\r\n\r\n1) When the SVN directories were in symbolically linked directories, svn\r\n   got into locked directory status\r\n2) Cleaning old relases failed to find the files in current directory,\r\n   because breeze changes working directory before running and the `.`\r\n   directory was really `airflow` repository, thus no released artifacts\r\n   could be found.\r\n3) When the old releases contained `_` rather thatn `-` (as it was\r\n   in the bdist_wheel prepared packages) then we failed to delet the\r\n   files because the file names for them were constructed from the\r\n   normalized file names (with `-`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes those problems:\r\n\r\n1) `VAR=$(pwd -P)` is used in order to resolve potentially symbolically\r\n   linked urrent working directory and `cd ${VAR}` is used to switch dir\r\n   to them\r\n2) The same `$(pwd -P)` is used to pass the directory to the\r\n   clean-old-provider-artifacts command to avoid interpreting `.` as\r\n   \"AIRFLOW_ROOT\" directory.\r\n3) Filen name is stored in FileVersion and used to run actual `svn rm`\r\n   command - this way the right file name will be used, regardless from\r\n   normalization of the package names.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we are building CI/PROD images, AIRFLOW_VERSION arg is retrieved from the current Airflow version set in version.py. This is find for main build when we are running image build tests, because there, the version contains `.dev0` and when we extend the image we can use `pip install airflow-version=${AIRFLOW_VERSION}`. However in release builds, the version in `version.py` does not contain version suffix, and this version of Airflow is not released yet.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by checking if version_suffix_for_pypi is set, and it case it is and airflow version does not contain it, we will add the suffix automatically.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

metric allow and block lists allow the user to set which metric names to emit, but they only match on `startswith()`.  This PR adds two new Validators - FuzzyAllow and FuzzyBlock, which match using regex - along with a config option to chooze between the \"basic\" or \"fuzzy\" match and unit testing.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in there I also noticed that the OTel metrics never implemented Blocklist, it only had an AllowList.  This could maybe have been a separate PR, but I fixed that bug while I was working on it since that would have required adjustments either way.\r\n\r\nThe new `get_validator()` method is a modified version of the decision logic previously used in the statsd logger, expanded to include the Fuzzy options, and then also applied to the otel logger.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
