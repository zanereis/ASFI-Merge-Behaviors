fixes the visual \"jank\" seen when loading the DAGs (home) view. Most of the unwanted shifting was being caused by the loading GIF images being shown briefly in the table header. This caused table cells to shift vertically and horizontally. The implementation was also a bit inconsistent in that it showed a loading state in two column headers (\"Recent Tasks\", \"DAG Runs\") and then in the individual cells of another (\"Last Run\"). I've remedied that by using the same placement for all three.\r\n\r\nI've moved the new \"loading dots\" pattern (CSS only, no images) introduced in #11534 to a macro file so that it could be repurposed here as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2020-10-21 at 02 05 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/96759894-9e85cd80-13a6-11eb-95db-dd5d3ce60fa5.gif)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2020-10-21 at 02 23 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/96766389-01786400-13a9-11eb-8736-c2c31bee4044.gif)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-21T18:26:15Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T16:14:28Z","closed_at":"2020-10-21T21:18:59Z","merged_at":"2020-10-21T21:18:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c3f4357f5c0a95d4a6772fdc45dce0acaf3ba7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Instead of requiring the user to select/deselect tags and then submit the form with the \"Filter tags\" button, the page now updates as the tag is selected/deselected.\r\n- ~Removes the storage of the tags in the `tags_filter` cookie. For a filtering pattern such as this, the URL params should always reflect the current result set. Currently, you can have your result set filtered by tags and have no `tags=` params in your URL. This also required using a `&reset_tags=Reset` param to clear the values—this will no longer be needed with the URL explicitly reflecting the values.~ Updated the server-side logic, so that if cookie values exist, the `tags=` param is added to the URL so it matches the filtered result set. I also made an update to strip the `reset_tags=reset` from the URL after the cookie value has been cleared.\r\n- Replaces the \"Reset\" button with an \"X\" icon button (same pattern used for search filter, added in #11583). This button only appears when tag filters are applied.\r\n- The sum of these updates yields a much simpler UI where we don't need persistent buttons taking up space.\r\n- Updates Docs screenshot\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n|  ![Screen Recording 2020-10-19 at 10 29 28 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/96464628-0943d700-11f6-11eb-9cb0-c6191f84a77b.gif) | ![Screen Recording 2020-10-19 at 10 13 27 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/96462703-ddbfed00-11f3-11eb-81bc-d7043b9df653.gif)  |\r\n\r\nCC: @zacharya19 thought you might be interested in these modifications to your feature originally added in #6489.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-19T14:40:09Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T16:14:27Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T20:23:20Z","merged_at":"2020-10-19T20:23:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"73f63671ef12e196eb51221cae43819ba3ac88f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Images are not built if the change is not touching code or docs.\r\n* In case we have no need for CI images we run stripped-down\r\n  pre-commit checks which skip the long checks and only run for\r\n  changed files\r\n* If none of the CLI/Providers/Kubernetes/WWW files changed\r\n  the relevant tests are skipped, unless some of the core files\r\n  changed as well.\r\n* The selective checks logic is explained and documented.\r\n\r\nThis is the second attempt at the problem with better\r\nstrategy to get the list of files from the incoming PR.\r\n\r\nThe strategy works now better in a number of

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\nAdds support for sorting DAGs in the UI by the ID, Schedule (next run, really) and Owner, ASC/DESC.\r\n\r\nThe sorting is done on the DB level and parameterized by two new URL parameters - sortBy for the model attribute & orderBy for the type of ordering (ascending/descending).\r\n\r\nThe default behavior is to sort by Dag ID and order by ascending, and therefore should not come as a surprise to current users.\r\n\r\nThe column headings in the DAG view have been turned to hyperlinks that pass the parameters for the sorting. For more predictable UX, when switching before sorting attributes (or when none is passed), clicking on a header will always sort it by ASC first. Clicking on the same header again after the page reloads will toggle it to DESC instead.

The current options were fairly straightforward to handle since the logic that populates the DAG list currently fetches a set of DagModels - this is just an exercise in filtering. Fetching and sorting DagRuns ran the risk of adding a fair bit of extra processing overhead and complicating the logic.\r\n\r\ncloses: #8459 \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**:\r\n![Screenshot_2020-10-21 DAGs - Airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4363639/96723444-7bf3b480-13a6-11eb-9f7f-a7ebcc25dd95.png)\r\n![Screenshot_2020-10-21 DAGs - Airflow(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4363639/96723449-7d24e180-13a6-11eb-80ea-f2d8c17b769a.png)\r\n![Screenshot_2020-10-21 DAGs - Airflow(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4363639/96723455-7eeea500-13a6-11eb-9d83-d3a71d124a73.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-19T08:38:41Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T00:06:29Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T00:06:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07d0883bebc3c3f5e6723d20b60e9512de0d0034","assignee":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

K8S tests on CI are controlled from the host, not from\r\ninside of the CI container image. Therefore it needs virtualenv\r\nto run the tests as well as some tools such as helm, kubectl\r\nand kind. While those tools can bee downloaded and installed\r\non demand, from time to time the download fails intermittently.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the following improvements:\r\n\r\n* the commands to download and setup kind, helm, kubectl are\r\n  repeated up to 4 times in case they fail\r\n\r\n* the \"bin\" directory where those binaries are downloaded is\r\n  cached between runs. Only the same combination of\r\n  versions of the tools are sharing the same cache.\r\n\r\nThis way both cases - regular re-runs of the same jobs and\r\nupgrade of tools will be much more stable.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

far breeze used in-container data for persisting it (mysql redis,\r\npostgres). This means that the data was kept as long, as long the\r\ncontainers were running. If you stopped Breeze via `stop` command\r\nthe data was always deleted.\r\n\r\nThis changes the behaviour - each of the Breeze containers has\r\na named volume where data is kept. Those volumes are also deleted\r\nby default when Breeze is stopped, but you can choose to preserve\r\nthem by adding ``--preserve-volumes`` when you run ``stop`` or\r\n``restart`` command.\r\n\r\nFixes: #11625\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

access with RBAC to URL has_dag_access results lose redirection. Fixes #11591\r\n\r\nWhen unauthenticated user visit an airflow page, it will be redirected to login page.\r\nNormally after user enter credentials and logged in, they will be redirected to the original airflow page they wanted to visit.\r\nHowever for pages marked having \"has_dag_access\" this redirection is not storing the original page url, this PR adds url as  \"next\" parameter to the /login page so that after user login, it'll go to the original page it intended.\r\n\r\nThis change make it consistent with the \"has_access\" decorator from flask_appbuilder:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11498\r\n\r\nIn order to further reduce intra-dag task scheduling lag we add an\r\noptimization: when a task has just finished executing (success or\r\nfailure) we can look at the downstream tasks of just that task, and then\r\nmake scheduling decisions for those tasks there -- we've already got the\r\ndag loaded, and we know they are likely actionable as we just finished.\r\n\r\nWe should set tasks to scheduled if we can (but no further, i.e. not to\r\nqueued, as the scheduler has to make that decision with info about the\r\nPool usage etc.).\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ash Berlin-Taylor <ash_github@firemirror.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
