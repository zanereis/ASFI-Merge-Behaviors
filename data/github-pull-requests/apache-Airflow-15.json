behaviour is very odd, and is not in anyway clear _why_ it's happening,\r\nbut the fix is to not construct a DAG object, but to use attrs to tell us what\r\nthe fields are -- which is better behaviour anyway.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue before this change:\r\n\r\n1. `pytest tests/serialization/test_dag_serialization.py::TestStringifiedDAGs::test_deserialization_with_dag_context` -> greeen\r\n2. `pytest tests/serialization/test_dag_serialization.py::TestStringifiedDAGs::test_deserialization_with_dag_context` -> boom\r\n\r\n(So by dag objects existing in the DB it somehow \"poluted\" the\r\nDagContextManager/TaskContextManager stack. I haven't dug into exactly how\r\nthat might be happening.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

For example, when submitting a Spark job using the DataprocSubmitJobOperator, we will include details about the Airflow task that triggered it so that the OpenLineage Spark integration can include them in parentRunFacet.\r\n\r\n## Why ?\r\n\r\nTo enable full pipeline visibility and track dependencies between jobs in OpenLineage, we utilize the parentRunFacet. This facet stores the identifier of the parent job that triggered the current job. This approach works across various integrations, f.e. you can pass Airflow’s job identifier to a Spark application if it was triggered by an Airflow operator. Currently, this process requires manual configuration by the user, such as leveraging [macros](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/macros.html):\r\n```\r\nDataprocSubmitJobOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"my_task\", \r\n    # ... \r\n    job={ \r\n        # ...\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.parentJobNamespace\": \"{{ macros.OpenLineageProviderPlugin.lineage_job_namespace() }}\",\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.parentJobName\": \"{{ macros.OpenLineageProviderPlugin.lineage_job_name(task_instance) }}\", \r\n        \"spark.openlineage.parentRunId\": \"{{ macros.OpenLineageProviderPlugin.lineage_run_id(task_instance) }}\"\r\n    } \r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnderstanding how various Airflow operators configure Spark allows us to automatically inject parent job information.\r\n\r\n## Controlling the Behavior\r\n\r\nWe provide users with a flexible control mechanism to manage this injection, combining per-operator enablement with a global fallback configuration. This design is inspired by the `deferrable` argument in Airflow.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nol_inject_parent_job_info: bool = conf.getboolean(\r\n    \"openlineage\", \"spark_inject_parent_job_info\", fallback=False\r\n)\r\n```\r\nEach supported operator will include an argument like `ol_inject_parent_job_info`, which defaults to the global configuration value of `openlineage.spark_inject_parent_job_info`. This approach allows users to:\r\n\r\n1. Control behavior on a per-job basis by explicitly setting the argument.\r\n2. Rely on a consistent default configuration for all jobs if the argument is not set.\r\n\r\nThis design ensures both flexibility and ease of use, enabling users to fine-tune their workflows while minimizing repetitive configuration. I am aware that adding an OpenLineage-related argument to the operator will affect all users, even those not using OpenLineage, but since it defaults to False and can be ignored, I hope this will not pose any issues.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThe implementation is divided into three parts for better organization and clarity:\r\n\r\n1. **Operator's Code (including the `execute` method):**  \r\n   Contains minimal logic to avoid overwhelming users who are not actively working with OpenLineage.\r\n\r\n2. **Google's Provider OpenLineage Utils File:**  \r\n   Handles the logic for accessing Spark properties specific to a given operator or job.\r\n\r\n3. **OpenLineage Provider's Utils:**  \r\n   Responsible for creating / extracting all necessary information in a format compatible with the OpenLineage Spark integration. We are also performing modifications to the Spark properties here.\r\n\r\nFor some operators parts 1 and 2 may be in the operator's code. In general, the specific operator / provider will know how to get the spark properties and the OL will know what to inject and do the injection itself.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n1. **Expand Operator Coverage:**  \r\n   Increase support for additional operators by extending the parent job information injection to cover more cases.\r\n\r\n2. **Automate Transport Configuration:**  \r\n   Implement similar automation for transport configurations, starting with HTTP, to streamline the integration process.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

support Airflow 2.x plugins in Airflow 3 the goal is to embed a minimal version of Airflow 2 in fast api using [WSGIMiddleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/wsgi/). The Airflow 2.x plugins will run in this application as they are running today in Airflow 2. `WSGIMiddleware` allows running a WSGI in the fast api application. This Flask application will be accessible under the path `/pluginsv2`.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to:\r\n1. (This PR) Copy files from core Airflow to Fab provider to create a minimal version of Airflow 2 in Fab provider. This minimal version of Airflow 2 should only contain core elements needed by the plugins to run. The goal is not to copy the entire Flask application but only a more simplified version of it. This minimal version of Airflow 2 in Fab provider should be self contained in Fab provider, they must not depend on Flask-related objects defined in core Airflow. The goal is, when the Flask application will be deleted from core Airflow, it should be possible because the mini Airflow 2 in Fab provider does not depend on it.\r\n2. (This PR as well) Embed the mini Airflow 2 defined in Fab provider in the fast api application so that Airflow 2.x plugins will be available in Airflow 3\r\n3. When the new Airflow 3 UI becomes the default UI and no fallback to the old UI is possible, remove the Flask application and all related resources (e.g. views) from core Airflow. \r\n\r\nThe idea is, if you do not have any Airflow 2.x plugin defined in your environment, you should not have Flask as dependency. On the opposite, if you do have some Airflow 2.x plugins in your environment, fab provider will have to be installed and all the code needed to run the Flask application will be in this provider.\r\n\r\nThe experience for the user will not be ideal because these plugins use the Airflow 2 UI, therefore the UI experience will be inconsistent between the Airflow pages (Airflow 3 UI) and the plugins (Airflow 2 UI). A warning message will be added in the embedded Flask application to let the user knows about this weird experience but also to recommend them to migrate their plugins to Airflow 3 plugins.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change removes all configuration that controls AIP-44 behaviour. It does not yet remove all the related code, this will be a follow up but it removes all the controls that determine if AIP-44 is enabled or not and removes all the Traceback Session/Disabling of DB session modifications that were used in \"database isolation\" mode. The \"database isolation\" mode has been disabled in #44441 so there was no easy way to enable it anyoway - this change removes the capability to use database isolation mode completely.\r\n\r\nPart of #44436\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The calls to \"Jobs\" API to (1) fetch a job and (2) report job state are now real REST API calls, not using internal API.\r\n\r\nI would separate the other internal API calls to follow-up PRs as this is already quite large.

(`authenticator: externalbrowser `): the cache config key is [`client_store_temporary_credential`](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/v3.12.3/src/snowflake/connector/connection.py#L224), which is introduced by this PR\r\n\r\nMore

also lays the groundwork for a more general purpose \"workload\" execution\nsystem, make a single interface for executors to run tasks and callbacks.\n\nAlso in this PR we set up the supervise function to send Task logs to a file,\nand handle the task log template rendering in the scheduler before queueing\nthe workload.\n\nAdditionally we don't pass the activity directly to `supervise()` but instead\nthe properties/fields of it to reduce the coupling between SDK and Executor.\n(More separation will appear in PRs over the next few weeks.)\n\nThe big change of note here is that rather than sending an airflow command\nline to execute (`[\"airflow\", \"tasks\", \"run\", ...]`) and going back in via the\nCLI parser we go directly to a special purpose function. Much simpler.\n\nIt doesn't remove any of the old behaviour (CeleryExecutor still uses\nLocalTaskJob via the CLI parser etc.), nor does anything currently send\ncallback requests via this new workload mechanism.\n\nThe `airflow.executors.workloads` module currently needs to be shared between\nthe Scheduler (or more specifically the Executor) and the \"worker\" side of\nthings. In the future these will be separate python dists and this module will\nneed to live somewhere else.\n\nRight now we check the if `executor.queue_workload` is different from the\nBaseExecutor version (which just raises an error right now) to see which\nexecutors support this new version. That check will be removed as soon as all\nthe in-tree executors have been migrated.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR handle missing DAGs when clearing task instances to prevent failures. When we delete DAG files and attempt to trigger them again, the process should access the DAGs and display an error indicating that the DAGs no longer exist, rather than causing the frontend to show an \"Oops\" error.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes:\r\n- Added warning logs for missing DAGs to prevent silent failures during task clearing.\r\n- Improved error handling for downstream task clearing, including checks for partial_subset errors to handle cases where DAGs or downstream dependencies are unavailable.\r\n- Updated the docstring for _clear_task_instances for better clarity and consistent style.\r\n- Refined the grouping and handling of Task Instances by DAG and DAG Run to improve robustness and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Issue Reference:\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44274\r\n\r\n^ Add meaningful description above\r\nRead the [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines) for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow

PR handle missing DAGs when clearing task instances to prevent failures. When we delete DAG files and attempt to trigger them again, the process should access the DAGs and display an error indicating that the DAGs no longer exist, rather than causing the frontend to show an \"Oops\" error.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes:\r\n- Added warning logs for missing DAGs to prevent silent failures during task clearing.\r\n- Improved error handling for downstream task clearing, including checks for partial_subset errors to handle cases where DAGs or downstream dependencies are unavailable.\r\n- Updated the docstring for _clear_task_instances for better clarity and consistent style.\r\n- Refined the grouping and handling of Task Instances by DAG and DAG Run to improve robustness and maintainability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Issue Reference:\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44274\r\n\r\n^ Add meaningful description above\r\nRead the [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines) for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party

Updated logic to handle externally updated TI state in Supervisor. This states could have been externally changed via UI, CLI, API etc\r\n- Replaced `FASTEST_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` and `SLOWEST_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` with `MIN_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` and `HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD` for better clarity\r\n\r\nThis is part of my efforts to port LocalTaskJob tests to Supervisor: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44356.\r\n\r\nThis ports over `TestLocalTaskJob.test_mark_{success,failure}_no_kill`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also allows retrying heartbeats:\r\n\r\n- Added `_last_successful_heartbeat` and `_last_heartbeat_attempt` for better separation of tracking successful heartbeats and retries.\r\n- `MIN_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` is now respected between heartbeat attempts, even after failures.\r\n-  The num of retries is configurable via `MAX_FAILED_HEARTBEATS`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
