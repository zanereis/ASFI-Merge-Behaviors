What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport DataFrame conversion to table arguments in Spark Classic, and enable UDTFs to accept table arguments in both PySpark and Scala.\r\n\r\nSpark Connect support will be a follow-up, with the goal of completing it by the end of this month.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTable-Valued Functions (TVFs) and User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs) are widely used in Spark workflows. These functions often require a table argument, which Spark internally represents as a Catalyst expression. While Spark SQL supports constructs like TABLE(<query>) for this purpose, **there is no direct API in PySpark or Scala to convert a DataFrame into a table argument**. So we propose to support DataFrame conversion to table arguments (in Spark Classic first), and enable UDTFs to accept table arguments in both PySpark and Scala..\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes DataFrame conversion to table argument is supported in Spark Classic, and UDTFs accept table arguments in both PySpark and Scala.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR followups https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48964 to fix `with_origin_to_class` to be called when the `Column` actually initializing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe don't need call `with_origin_to_class` if the Column API is not used.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the current way is not working properly from Spark Connect as it causes circular import error as mentioned from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48964#discussion_r1868569335 so this is more safer way to support `with_origin_to_class`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the Spark Connect Python client no longer issues circular import error when initializing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\n**Before (Failed initializing Spark Connect Python client)**\r\n```\r\n% ./bin/pyspark --remote local\r\nPython

import name 'SparkSession' from partially initialized module 'pyspark.sql.connect.session' (most likely due to a circular import) (/Users/haejoon.lee/Desktop/git_repos/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/session.py)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After (Successfully initializing Spark Connect Python client)**\r\n```\r\n% ./bin/pyspark --remote local\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /__ / .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 4.0.0.dev0\r\n      /_/\r\n\r\nUsing Python version 3.9.17 (main, Jul  5 2023 15:35:09)\r\nClient connected to the Spark Connect server at localhost\r\nSparkSession available as 'spark'.\r\n>>>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR unwraps SparkThrowable in (Unchecked)ExecutionException thrown by tableRelationCache\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe guava cache library wraps exceptions thrown by `c: Callable[LogicalPlan]` as `(Unchecked)ExecutionException`s. This makes our code paths of special handling for SparkThrowable inoperative. For example, this kind of error in spark-sql cli is very lengthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, when you visit an invalid plan in the table cache layer, you will get the original spark error instead of getting them under `(Unchecked)ExecutionException`s\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to deprecated no-op `spark.shuffle.spill` config in Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n- Previously, it complains only `spark.shuffle.spill=false`.\r\n- We had better deprecate this configuration explicitly to simplify Apache Spark 4+ configuration space.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 1.6.0, `spark.shuffle.spill` has been ignored completely.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8831\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThere is no Spark shuffle behavior change. Only it will show additional deprecation message when `spark.shuffle.spill=true` is used by users explicitly.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE: Only spark.shuffle.spill=false**\r\n```\r\n24/12/03 10:37:23 WARN SortShuffleManager: spark.shuffle.spill was set to false, but this configuration is ignored as of Spark 1.6+. Shuffle will continue to spill to disk when necessary.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER: Both spark.shuffle.spill=false and spark.shuffle.spill=true**\r\n```\r\n24/12/03 10:37:47 WARN SparkConf: The configuration key 'spark.shuffle.spill' has been deprecated as of Spark 1.6 and may be removed in the future. Not used anymore.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-03T18:31:23Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T01:40:44Z","closed_at":"2024-12-04T01:31:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1cd34bbb0edb71aeaf7cd7f4294914baf7c3fe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35ac1825c742af86ba23a80c653d9bdeaf0d035c","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50482","ref":"SPARK-50482","sha":"35ac1825c742af86ba23a80c653d9bdeaf0d035c","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `canUpCast` method in `UpCastRule.scala` we match against `StringType`, which does not match collated string, as opposed to matching `_: StringType`. Similarly, in `needsTimeZone` method in `Cast.scala` it is matched against non collated StringType. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpcasting to collated strings was disabled even when upcasting to non collated strings was not. Likewise, casting from timestamp to collated string did not need time zone. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. \r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest added in `DataTypeWriteCompatibilitySuite.scala` and `CastSuiteBase.scala`. \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo. \r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a generalized and streamlined approach to handling exceptions in the Spark Connect Python client.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n1. Replaces the large if-else block for exception type matching with a more extensible class mapping (`EXCEPTION_CLASS_MAPPING`).\r\n2. Maintains compatibility for existing exception types while making it easier to add new ones in the future.\r\n3. Keeps the unique handling logic for specific exceptions like `PythonException` intact.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe previous exception handling logic relied on a large `if-else` block, which was not scalable or maintainable as more exception types were added.\r\n\r\nGeneralizing the exception handling mechanism reduces the complexity of the code, making it easier to extend when adding new exception types now requires minimal changes to the `EXCEPTION_CLASS_MAPPING`, avoiding duplication of logic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but it enhances the internal implementation of exception handling.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UTs to verify that all existing exception handling scenarios are still supported.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-03T09:42:32Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T06:28:29Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T06:27:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7740f4ddb8c7e322bcb5e6b242e7bebe69ead96c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bbb7277596c466298f6ad62f92e6f74f03cf02eb","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-50460","ref":"SPARK-50460","sha":"bbb7277596c466298f6ad62f92e6f74f03cf02eb","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe added a couple of helper functions that make it easier to work Columns in the Classic API. This covers functionality that creates a Column from an Expression, and creating (named) Expressions from a Column. There are currently multiple ways of doing the same thing and this is confusing. This PR attempts to simplify this a bit, by making the following changes:\r\n\r\n- `ExpressionUtils` is moved to the background. `ClassicConversions`/`ColumnConversion` are now predominantly used. The benefit of this is that most code now looks like pre-Spark 4 code.\r\n- `ExpressionUtils.expression(..)` and `ExpressionUtils.column(..)` are not implicit anymore.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for DROP and AS operators.\r\n\r\nThe DROP operator removes one or more existing column from the input table.\r\nThe AS operator assigns a new table alias to the preceding relation.\r\n\r\nThese are equivalent to `SELECT * EXCEPT(<columnNames>)` and `SELECT ... FROM (...) <tableAlias>`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalues (0, 'pqr', 2), (3, 'tuv', 5) as tab(a, b, c)\r\n|> as v\r\n|> drop v.b\r\n|> drop v.c\r\n\r\n0\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a small bug and adds more testing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to actually more conservatively preserve the original code of creating new properties instead of cloning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPrevious codes only copied the key and values but `clone` actually copies more fields in `Properties`. `cloneProperties` is being used in Spark Core, and all other components so I propose to keep the logic as is.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is more a fix of a potential bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo, it is difficult to add a test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-03T00:18:18Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T00:28:16Z","closed_at":"2024-12-03T06:37:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f8540808dc7c6637337aa4f3b53740f23b29da8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/56825f5aa12db477a68f7fc839b302e87e6fb57f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-50430-followup","ref":"SPARK-50430-followup","sha":"56825f5aa12db477a68f7fc839b302e87e6fb57f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds DataFrame API for Lateral Joins.\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\n\r\nFor the following DataFrames `customers` and `orders`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> customers.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- customer_id: long (nullable = true)\r\n |-- name: string (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n>>> orders.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- order_id: long (nullable = true)\r\n |-- customer_id: long (nullable = true)\r\n |-- order_date: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- items: array (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- element: struct (containsNull = true)\r\n |    |    |-- product: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- quantity: long (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Using TVF\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# select customer_id, name, order_id, order_date, product, quantity\r\n# from customers join orders using (customer_id) join lateral (select col.* from explode(items))\r\n# order by customer_id, order_id, product\r\ncustomers.join(orders, \"customer_id\").lateralJoin(\r\n    spark.tvf.explode(sf.col(\"items\").outer()).select(\"col.*\")\r\n).select(\r\n    \"customer_id\", \"name\", \"order_id\", \"order_date\", \"product\", \"quantity\"\r\n).orderBy(\"customer_id\", \"order_id\", \"product\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Using Subquery\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# select c.customer_id, name, order_id, order_date\r\n# from customers c left join lateral (\r\n#     select * from orders o where o.customer_id = c.customer_id order by order_date desc limit 2\r\n# )\r\n# order by customer_id, order_id\r\ncustomers.alias(\"c\").lateralJoin(\r\n    orders.alias(\"o\")\r\n    .where(sf.col(\"o.customer_id\") == sf.col(\"c.customer_id\").outer())\r\n    .orderBy(sf.col(\"order_date\").desc())\r\n    .limit(2),\r\n    how=\"left\"\r\n).select(\r\n    \"c.customer_id\", \"name\", \"order_id\", \"order_date\"\r\n).orderBy(\"customer_id\", \"order_id\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLateral Join APIs are missing in DataFrame API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new DataFrame APIs for lateral join will be available.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-02T22:39:27Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T01:40:55Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T01:40:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f804dc098d57b3b1cbf391ed2bdf8a93560eda3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df47b6ae9b26d1fdd0a0b7622e07c98d7b03542c","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-50132/lateral_join","ref":"issues/SPARK-50132/lateral_join","sha":"df47b6ae9b26d1fdd0a0b7622e07c98d7b03542c","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis introduces two new config parameters for TTL based cleaning which remove blocks which are not used for a given period of time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe depend on garbage collection happening to tell us when RDDs/DataFrames are no longer referenced, but when those are defined the global scope those will not be cleaned up. Rather than cleaning up the RDD/DataFrame based on the TTL we only clean up the blocks so that if the TTL is too short and the user does use that RDD or DataFrame again in the future their code will not fail, but instead re-create those blocks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNew config parameters are introduced.

This method rebuilds the Variant value to refer to the new metadata dictionary in the builder, so we should not be using it in shredding, where all dictionary IDs now refer to the original Variant metadata.\r\n\r\n1) When writing a Variant value that does not match the shredding type. The code was doing the right thing, but unnecessarily calling `variantBuilder.appendVariant` and then discarding the result. The PR removes that dead code.\r\n2) When reconstructing a Variant object that contains only the fields of the original object that don't appear in the shredding schema. This is a correctness bug, since we would modify the value to use new dictionary IDs that do not correspond to the ones in the original metadata.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nVariant

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAccording to the issue description collation usage on keys of map may lead for unexpected effects (key duplication). This PR blocks this usage, but it is still available with Spark conf flag.\r\nOld behavior is enabled by `spark.sql.collation.allowInMapKeys`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBecause usage may create unclear situation. For example if we have `map('A' -> 1, 'a' -> 2)` then changing collation from UTF8_BINARY to UTF8_LCASE break key uniqueness.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the initial PR for the single-pass Analyzer project.\r\n\r\nCoverage:\r\n- Scans of csv/json/parquet/orc/hive tables and files\r\n- `VALUES`\r\n- `WHERE`\r\n- `LIMIT`\r\n- Trivial star expansion\r\n- Literals\r\n- Aliases\r\n- Binary arithmetic\r\n- Binary logic\r\n\r\nMain components:\r\n\r\n`HybridAnalyzer`:\r\nThe analysis is now routed between the fixed-point and single-pass by the `HybridAnalyzer`. There are 3 modes:\r\n- Fixed-point. In that case `HybridAnalyzer` just calls `executeAndTrack`. This is the default one.\r\n- Dual. This one is activated by the `spark.sql.analyzer.singlePassResolver.dualRunWithLegacy` flag and involves a filtering logic based on the `ResolverGuard`. First, the query is always analyzed by the fixed-point `Analyzer`, and then, if it's supported by the single-pass, it's analyzed by the `Resolver`.\r\n- Single-pass. In that case `HybridAnalyzer` calls the single-pass `Resolver` without any filtering or routing. This is useful for debugging.\r\n\r\n`ResolverGuard`:\r\nThis component allows `HybridAnalyzer` to figure out whether a SQL query/DataFrame program is supported by the single-pass `Resolver`. Here we do a simple pass over the operator/expression tree with a short-circuited boolean logic.\r\n\r\n`Resolver`:\r\nThis is the main entry point for the single-pass analysis. All the operators are resolved here. If the new operator is introduced into the Catalyst, it should be handled in the `resolve(...)` pattern match. The operator is either resolved here, or the resolution is delegated to the extensions.\r\n\r\n`ExpressionResolver`:\r\nSimilar to the `Resolver`, this is the main entry point for the expression analysis. The resolution either happens here, or is delegated to specific resolvers (e.g. `BinaryArithmeticResolver`, `TimeZoneAwareExpressionResolver`). The `Resolver` calls the `ExpressionResolver` to resolve expressions nested in operators.\r\n\r\n`MetadataResolver`:\r\nThe `MetadataResolver` is used by the `Resolver` to look up relation metadata and store it in a map by `RelationId`. There are two modes:\r\n- `AnalyzerBridgeState` from the fixed-point `Analyzer` is available. In that case we just reuse the existing relation metadata from the fixed-point run. This is done to avoid latency/consistency issues.\r\n- Otherwise, we collect the metadata using `RelationResolution`.\r\n\r\n`ResolverExtension`:\r\nThis is a trait that allows extending the `Resolver`. Its `resolveOperator` must deterministically match the unresolved plan node - a conflict between the configured extensions is disallowed.\r\n\r\n`NameScope`:\r\nThis component controls the visibility of names (tables, columns, aliases), star expansion for tables and structs and operator output handling. A new `NameScope` is created when a new scope is introduced (`Project`, `Aggregate`). We add operator output to the `NameScope` to later look up unresolved attributes and aliases. The `NameScope`s are stacked together to further support correlated names.\r\n\r\n`DataSourceResolver`/`DataSourceWithHiveResolver`:\r\nThose extensions allow us to resolve relation nodes (e.g. `UnresolvedCatalogRelation`, `LogicalRelation`, `HiveTableRelation`) defined outside of `catalyst` package to avoid depending on those packages (that would require a cyclic import).\r\n\r\n`ResolutionValidator`/`ExpressionResolutionValidator`:\r\nThese components work together on the resolved tree and assert invariants that should be true no matter which SQL query/DataFrame program was passed to the single-pass analyzer. For example, we validate that expressions used in project lists actually exist in the lower operator outputs (using `AttributeScopeStack`). Every `resolve*` method in `Resolver`/`ExpressionResolver` must have its `validate*` counterpart in the `ResolutionValidator`/`ExpressionResolutionValidator`.\r\n\r\n`TracksResolvedNodes`:\r\nThis is another validation mechanism which asserts that the analysis is actually single-pass - we store a reference to any resolved node in a set, and prior to the resolution check that a reference to the passed node hasn't been previously analyzed.\r\n\r\nThanks @mihailoale-db and @mihailotim-db for working on that!\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe want to build a new single-pass Analyzer to replace the fixed-point one.\r\n\r\nSPIP Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49834\r\nSPIP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dWxvrJV-0joGdLtWbvJ0uNyTocDMJ90rPRNWa4T56Og\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the single-pass Analyzer is disabled by default (under the `spark.sql.analyzer.singlePassResolver.enabled` and `spark.sql.analyzer.singlePassResolver.dualRunWithLegacy` flags).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- New test suites\r\n- Ran some suites with `spark.sql.analyzer.singlePassResolver.dualRunWithLegacy` enabled\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new `Clustering` node in `V1Writes` rule if required ordering does not match the output ordering, to avoid eliminating user sort in `EliminateSorts` optimizer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`V1Writes` pull out the local sort node from `FileFormatWriter`, but the original sort node would be eliminated in `EliminateSorts` rule, which cause the user's sort missing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/800faf0abfa368ad0a5ef1e0fa44b74dbaab724e frees column vector resources between batches in columnar to row conversion. However, like `WritableColumnVector`, `ConstantColumnVector` should not free resources between batches because the same data is used across batches\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout this change, ConstantColumnVectors with string values, for example, will fail if used with column->row conversion. For instance, reading a parquet table partitioned by a string column with multiple batches.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadded UT that failed before and now passes\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46408 attempts to set the feature flag `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` in the JSON parser and reverts the flag to the original value. The reverting code is incorrect and accidentally sets the `AUTO_CLOSE_SOURCE` feature to false. The reason is that `overrideStdFeatures(value, mask)` sets the feature flags selected by `mask` to `value`. `originalMask` is a value of 0/1. When it is 1, it selects `AUTO_CLOSE_SOURCE`, whose ordinal is 0 ([reference](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/172369cc390ace0f68a5032701634bdc984c2af8/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser.java#L112)). The old code doesn't revert `INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` to the original value either. As a result, when the JSON parser is closed, the underlying input stream is not closed, which can lead to memory leak.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPerform the originally intended feature, and avoid memory leak.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test. It would fail without the change in the PR.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-30T01:07:58Z","updated_at":"2024-12-01T23:37:52Z","closed_at":"2024-12-01T23:37:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99a1c9c39c9107f2267cf3fc5e0648429c9ac8ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a166d5a29870f0cf56b7d0b82f98962dccd748f","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:fix_json_parser_flag","ref":"fix_json_parser_flag","sha":"4a166d5a29870f0cf56b7d0b82f98962dccd748f","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a caching mechanism for the classloader of `ArtifactManager`, to avoid re-generating a new one every time when a SQL query runs. This change also fixes a longstanding bug where the codegen cache was broken for Spark Connect, due to new classloaders causing cache misses: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/05728e4ff64e6684d7c6501f8a079e3b9aded9ed/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/CodeGenerator.scala#L1487-L1490.\r\n\r\nThe approach we use is to cache the generated classloader until a new artifact is added.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve performance and fix codegen caching.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded two new test cases.\r\nAlso, some existing tests will fail when the config `ARTIFACTS_SESSION_ISOLATION_ALWAYS_APPLY_CLASSLOADER` is enabled:\r\n\r\n- AdaptiveQueryExecSuite: `SPARK-37753: Inhibit broadcast in left outer join when there are many empty partitions on outer/left side`\r\n- DatasetOptimizationSuite: `SPARK-27871: Dataset encoder should benefit from codegen cache`\r\n\r\nThese tests will not fail after this PR.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-28T15:36:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T17:28:17Z","closed_at":"2024-12-20T00:10:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65748f6fbf345a545de1f7a0f8a8e2bb25bd17fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6157a1f6530c362799a0e595ad0163f0bc392a4b","head":{"label":"xupefei:cache-artifact-classloader","ref":"cache-artifact-classloader","sha":"6157a1f6530c362799a0e595ad0163f0bc392a4b","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the option to `applyInArrow` to take a function that takes an iterator of `RecordBatch` and returns an iterator of `RecordBatch`, and respect `spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch` on the input iterator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBeing limited to returning a single Table requires collecting all results in memory for a single batch. This can require excessive memory for certain edge cases with large groups. Currently the Python worker immediately converts a table into it's underlying batches, so there's barely any changes required to accommodate this. There are larger changes required to support max records per batch on the input side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new function signature supported by `applyInArrow`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing UTs to test both Table signatures and RecordBatch signatures\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReplace the use of System.currentTimeMillis with System.nanoTime.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSystem.currentTimeMillis is not considered a steady clock as the value is subject to system time adjustments, e.g., NTP synchronization, which causes sporadic test failure issues with ReattachableExecuteSuite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReattachableExecuteSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a configuration for async execution for Python UDF with Arrow optimization. One usecase is, for exmaple, to have RESTful API requests within Python UDF, and it slows down by I/O. By this configuration, those I/O requests can happen in parallel.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to speed up UDF executions. For example, the code below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.pythonUDF.arrow.concurrency.level\", 10)\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.pythonUDF.arrow.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n@udf\r\ndef my_rest_func(x):\r\n    import requests\r\n    requests.get(\"https://httpbin.org/get\")\r\n\r\n\r\nstart_time = time.time()\r\n_ = spark.range(100).coalesce(1).select(my_rest_func(col(\"id\"))).collect()\r\nprint(time.time() - start_time)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan be 10x faster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a new configuration called `spark.sql.execution.pythonUDF.arrow.concurrency.level`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested as shown above, and unittests were also added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-28T06:42:42Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T01:49:28Z","closed_at":"2024-11-29T04:39:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a857e96fb59237399cf2755fc9e868a2a6a7b46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/630107531ae3a39be2f9eb84b8542c0604c2c261","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:async-exec","ref":"async-exec","sha":"630107531ae3a39be2f9eb84b8542c0604c2c261","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip the parameter mode check in `Call` command\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe procedure interface requires all parameters's mode must be `IN` in a `Call` command, this is too strict, e.g. in [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-call.html)\r\n\r\n> Arguments must be supplied for all procedure parameters that lack defaults, including OUT parameters. However, arguments matching OUT parameters are not evaluated, so it's customary to just write NULL for them. (Writing something else for an OUT parameter might cause compatibility problems with future PostgreSQL versions.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix parametrized identifiers not working when referencing CTEs\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor a query:\r\n\r\n`with t1 as (select 1) select * from identifier(:cte) using cte as \"t1\"`\r\n\r\nthe resolution fails because `BindParameters` can't resolve parameters because it waits for `ResolveIdentifierClause` to resolve `UnresolvedWithCTERelation`, but `ResolveIdentifierClause` can't resolve `UnresolvedWithCTERelation` until all `NamedParameters` in the plan are resolved.\r\n\r\nInstead of delaying CTE resolution with `UnresolvedWithCTERelation`, we can remove node entirely and delay the resolution by keeping the original `PlanWithUnresolvedIdentifier` and moving the CTE resolution to its `planBuilder`.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test to `ParametersSuite`\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore this PR, SQL Scripting grammar allowed for loops, IF and CASE to have empty bodies. Example:\r\n\r\n`WHILE 1 = 1 DO END WHILE;`\r\n\r\nIf they have an empty body, an internal error is thrown during execution. This PR changes the grammar so that loops, IF and CASE must have at least one statement in their bodies. \r\n\r\nNote that this does not completely fix the internal error issue. It is still possible to have something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nWHILE 1 = 1 DO \r\n  BEGIN\r\n  END;\r\nEND WHILE;\r\n```\r\nwhere the same error is still thrown, except this construct is correct grammar wise.\r\nThis issue will be fixed by a separate PR, as non-trivial interpreter logic changes are required.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing grammar was wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests that make sure parsing loops, IF and CASE with empty bodies throws an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-27T15:28:02Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T04:31:04Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T04:31:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82a9f921de59a2c5dfefb509754db1221da2bcfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1cafcb5d5b6ec122d483287195bf1c982892f437","head":{"label":"dusantism-db:scripting-empty-bodies-fix","ref":"scripting-empty-bodies-fix","sha":"1cafcb5d5b6ec122d483287195bf1c982892f437","user":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":834060712,"node_id":"R_kgDOMbbBqA","name":"spark","full_name":"dusantism-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusantism-db","id":176312626,"node_id":"U_kgDOCoJRMg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176312626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusantism-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusantism-db/spark","description":"Apache

This is a safe removal because we don't have any release to support that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbackward-compatibility improvement\r\n \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers can store/read struct-typed columns with special characters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### tests provided by SPARK-22431\r\n```scala\r\nDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-22431: table with nested type col with special char\") \r\nDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-22431: view with nested type\") \r\nHiveDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-22431: table with nested type\") {\r\nHiveDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-22431: view with nested type\") {\r\nHiveDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-22431: alter table tests with nested types\") {\r\n```\r\n#### tests provided by the previous PR towards SPARK-46934\r\n```scala\r\nHiveMetastoreCatalogSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-46934: HMS columns cannot handle quoted columns\") \r\nHiveMetastoreCatalogSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-46934: Handle special characters in struct types\") {\r\nHiveMetastoreCatalogSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-46934: Handle special characters in struct types with CTAS\") {\r\nHiveMetastoreCatalogSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-46934: Handle special characters in struct types with hive DDL\") {\r\nHiveDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-46934: quote element name before parsing struct\") {\r\nHiveDDLSuite.scala:  test(\"SPARK-46934: alter table tests with nested types\") {\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### manually backward compatibility test \r\n\r\n1. create a tarball with the current revison\r\n2. cd dist\r\n3. using spark-sql to mock data\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT named_struct('a.b.b', array('a'), 'a b c', map(1, 'a')) AS `a.b`;\r\n```\r\n4. copy metadata to 3.5.3 release \r\n\r\n```\r\ncp -r ~/spark/dist/metastore_db .\r\n```\r\n5.

The function\r\n`ObjectOperator.deserializeRowToObject` is called twice do generate the deserializer for the key and value.  The function will do the following things\r\n1. Generate java code for the deserializer based on input expression and grouping attributes\r\n2. Compile that java code to java class\r\n\r\nThe problem is that step 1 will occur every time the function is called.  The compiling the code, i.e. step 2, will only happen once since the generated class will be cached and can be reused.\r\n\r\nStep 1 can incur a heavy penalty in situations where handleInputRows will be called many times.  For example, if there are many distinct keys.  Note that handleInputRows is called once per distinct key.\r\n\r\nHere is a flamegraph:\r\n\r\n![Uploading Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 11.55.12 PM.png…]()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove workaround for THRIFT-4805 in log4j2 configuration files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-47018 upgrades Thrift 0.16, and THRIFT-4805 was fixed in Thrift 0.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAffects default logs a little.\r\n\r\nThe existing logging filter rules use a regex to filter out the noisy logs caused by THRIFT-4805, while other problems may also produce similar logs and silently be dropped, this change restores that.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nReview.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to restore the codegen implementation of `JsonToStructs`(`from_json`) in the way of `manually`, rather than in the way of `Invoke`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBased on @cloud-fan's double-check, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48509#discussion_r1858515472\r\nI believe that restore to manual implementation will not result in regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate existed UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade sbt from `1.9.3` to `1.10.6`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- After version sbt `1.9.3`, if there are corrupt jars under the local (~/. m2), the GA's job `MIMA test` will fail to compile. Based on this, we added an environment variable (`SKIP_LOCAL_M2`) in `SparkBuild` to control whether to use the `Maven Local Resolver` mechanism.\r\n\r\n- Based on this discussion https://github.com/coursier/coursier/issues/2942#issuecomment-2145674637, `coursier` (`sbt` relies on it) will `not` solve this problem in the `short` term.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates the data source lookup logic to avoid triggering expensive Python data source lookups when the data source is a built-in or Java data source.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPython data source lookups can be expensive, and they are often unnecessary when users only use built-in or Java data sources. The primary benefit of the lookup is to display a better error message when a Java data source and a Python data source share the same name, which can be rare. In these cases, we can simply prefer loading Java data sources instead of throwing exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe disabled the DataFrameQueryContext from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48827, and we also need adding a flag for PySpark for the same performant reason.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid the performance slowdown for the case when the DataFrameQueryContext too much stacked\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the DataFrameQueryContext would no longer displayed when the flag is disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n1. **FLAG ON (almost 25sec)**\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.conf.get(\"spark.python.sql.dataFrameDebugging.enabled\")\r\n'true'\r\n>>> import time\r\n>>> import pyspark.sql.functions as

However, due to how we are checking for default string type (using reference equals with `StringType` object) we cannot just replace this object with `StringType(\"UTF8_BINARY\")` because they compare as equal so the tree node framework will just return the old plan. Because of this we have to perform this resolution twice, once by changing the `StringType` object into a `TemporaryStringType` and then back to `StringType(\"UTF8_BINARY\")` which is not considered a default string type anymore.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that the dependent rules `ResolveInlineTables` and `CollationTypeCoercion` are updated so that they don't execute if there are still unresolved string types in the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe default collation for DDL commands should be tied to the object being created or altered (e.g., table, view, schema) rather than the session-level setting.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the Spark SQL grammar to allow an optional trailing comma at the end of SELECT lists, and other named expression lists.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is controlled by the configuration `spark.sql.optionalTrailingCommaInNamedExpressionLists` (`SQLConf.get.OPTIONAL_TRAILING_COMMA_IN_NAMED_EXPRESSION_LISTS`). The new configuration is true by default as of its introduction in this PR.\r\n\r\nFor example, this query was not valid syntax before, but is now:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1, 2, FROM t\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter deliberation, we decided it was useful to have this support to help with migration from other legacy databases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test cases with the configuration enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds option `spark.storage.decommission.fallbackStorage.subDirectories` that allows to control the maximum number of directories created by the `FallbackStorage` per shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current implementation creates a directory foreach shuffle file that is being copied. For instance, a 100,000 partition shuffle creates 100,000 directories, each containing a single file. While S3 is very happy about this strategy, other filesystem might unnecessarily struggle. Some control about the upper limit of directories is useful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdds option `spark.storage.decommission.fallbackStorage.subDirectories`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-25T19:37:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T14:16:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"553f52f86a5566ad000b68408f196cb8825eca1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c89fdc28af5dfa010509055b99376d97cb22c1b8","head":{"label":"G-Research:fallback-storage-hash-bins","ref":"fallback-storage-hash-bins","sha":"c89fdc28af5dfa010509055b99376d97cb22c1b8","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache
