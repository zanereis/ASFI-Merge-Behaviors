follow up to #8366. Right now, storage scope information are spread across three components:\r\n* `AttrStmt` with `attr::storage_scope` key\r\n* `PointerType` \r\n* `Buffer` class https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/2cca934aad1635e3a83b712958ea83ff65704316/include/tvm/tir/buffer.h#L70-L71\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8366, storage scopes associated with `AttrStmt` and `PointerType` are identical. To consolidate storage scope information into one place, I'm proposing to remove storage scope in `AttrStmt` and `Buffer` class. \r\n\r\nThis PR is for the latter refactoring.

discussion in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/cuda-enable-half2-in-cuda-injective-schedule/10441, this PR improves the CUDA injective schedule to benefit more from `half2` when working on `float16`.\r\n\r\nThe background is that although the CUDA injective schedule does vectorize the innermost loop when working on float16, the vectorization may fail due to the if-conditions introduced by non-dividable workload and block/thread sizes. Formally, vectorization requires `prod(output_shape) % block % thread % vector_width == 0`. To make sure vectorization is effective, this PR adjusts the block and thread sizes accordingly (see the code change for details).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the output shapes are weird (e.g., prime numbers), the selected block and thread sizes may be too small. For example, if the output shape is `(311, 3814)`, then factors are `(1, 2, 311, 1907, 3814)`. As a result, we may select `(block, thread) = (2, 311)` with the consideration of the maximum `(block, thread) = (256, 1024)`. In this case, we don't utilize the compute resources well even `half2` is enabled.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should pad the output to let the factors always be power of two, but it is too complicate and may introduce other issues. Accordingly, another heuristic introduced by this PR is that when `(select_block * select_thread) / (max_block * max_thread) < R`, then we don't apply the change and let the vectorization failed.\r\n\r\nHere is the evaluation results when `R=0.7`.\r\n* Workloads: FP32Mul_FP16Add, FP16Mul_FP16Add, FP16Mul, Cast, FP32Mul_FP32Add, FP32Mul.\r\n* Output shapes: I manually assigned two shapes (768, 3072), (1, 1000) and randomly generated additional 100 shapes ranging from 1 to 4096.\r\n* Platform: NVIDIA T4 and V100.\r\n\r\nFor each platform, I displayed the worst, the best, and the

overrides `__eq__` but misses

using Relay IR as a frontend, we think it would be nice to have a reasonable visualization tool.\r\nThis draft PR follows:\r\n1. https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4370\r\n2. https://tvm.apache.org/2020/07/14/bert-pytorch-tvm\r\n3. https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-visualizing-relay-program-as-graph/4825\r\n\r\nWe try to define an interface Plotter to enable different plotting library.\r\nCurrently [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) is chosen due to its interactive capability.\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\nhttps://github.com/chiwwang/tvm/blob/tmp4viz/python/tvm/contrib/relay_viz/resnet18.html\r\n\r\nREADME:\r\nhttps://github.com/chiwwang/tvm/blob/relayviz/python/tvm/contrib/relay_viz/README.md\r\n\r\nWe want to have your thoughts on this topic. More details are in the [RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-visualizing-relay-program-as-graph/4825).\r\n\r\nThanks:)\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

the forum discussion (https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/questions-about-tvm-executors-and-its-apis/10289/3) and the tutorials https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/frontend/from_keras.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-frontend-from-keras-py and https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/frontend/from_onnx.html#compile-the-model-with-relay there is some performance mismatch between the two apis. \r\n\r\nThis [repo](https://github.com/mikepapadim/tvm_issue) captures the performance issue. \r\n\r\nIt seems when one uses the relay API as in the example below, `params` are not passed properly to the TIR and all optimizations regarding constants (i.e., constant folding) are prevented. Therefore, this leads to a performance mismatch with the `relay.vm.compile(mod, target=target, params=params)` .\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\nvm_executor = relay.create_executor(\"vm\", mod, tvm.cpu(0), target)\r\nvm_executor.evaluate()(input_data, **params)\r\n```\r\nThis PR modifies the above to accept: \r\n```\r\nvm_executor = relay.create_executor(\"vm\", mod, tvm.cpu(0), target, params)\r\nvm_executor.evaluate()(input_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this modification ```relay.vm.compile``` and ```relay.create_executor``` generate the same bytecodes while applying the same opts.\r\n\r\n\r\n@jroesch  @tqchen @YuchenJin @ZihengJiang

more clearly from the cuda code generated. The TIR implementation of scatter_nd would cause a int32 overflow when \"i\" is large, thus the if statement is always evaluate to true, and conducts a invalid memory access.

PR adds a pre-commit hook configuration file.\r\nThis configuration aims to encourage running the sanity checks on Jenkins, locally prior to committing. \r\n\r\nHow to install:\r\n```pip install pre-commit```\r\n```pre-commit install```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pre-commit configuration will run the following checks on each `git commit`:\r\n```\r\nCheck for added large files..........................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nCheck for merge conflicts............................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nCheck Yaml...........................................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nFix End of Files.....................................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nTrim Trailing Whitespace.............................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nRunning Minimal Unit-Tests ..............................................Passed\r\nRunning Black............................................................Passed\r\nChecking File Types......................................................Passed\r\nChecking ASF License Headers ............................................Passed\r\nLinting the C++ code ................................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nChecking Clang format ...............................(no files to check)Skipped\r\nType Checking with MyPY .................................................Passed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, as WIP branches tend to fail tests on early stages of development the above-mentioned checks can be prevented with:\r\n``` git commit --no-verify ``` or ```git commit -n ```\r\n\r\n**Requirements**: pip3 install cpplint pylint==2.4.4 mypy==0.902 black==20.8b1 pre-commit==2.3.0\r\n\r\n@hogepodge @areusch @jroesch @jcf94

PR implements the [Project API RFC](https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/8), a plugin-like infrastructure that allows TVM to interact with build tools for third-party platforms. By implementing the Project API interface for a platform, developers can run core TVM workflows such as host-driven inference and AutoTVM without needing to build the full TVM library on the platform. This is initially targeted at microTVM use cases, where platforms don't have the OS facilities nor the flash space to run a full TVM C++ runtime nor a Python interpreter.\r\n\r\nMore discussion is available in the RFC. Implementations are provided here for Zephyr and for the POSIX subprocess test platform.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This PR is based on top of #8072 and will merge following that one.\r\n\r\n@mehrdadh @guberti

find the current implementation of `relay.nn.batch_matmul` will fail given input tensors with shape `(Any(), M, K)` and `(Any(), N, K)`.  This is caused by the wrong implementation of `batch_matmul`'s type relation. When the input tensor has a dynamic shape but not all dimensions are dynamic, this relation function will use `x`'s shape directly and output wrong results.\r\n\r\nFor example, given `x` with shape `(Any(), 16, 32)` and `y` with shape `(Any(), 16, 32)`, the output shape of current implementation is `(Any(), 16,

my AMD 3950X, `/sys/devices/systen/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq` is not the same across all cores. If I look at `scaling_max_freq` instead, then I see that all cores are the same frequency (as expected). This probably still won't work correctly across all platforms, but I don't think there is an easier, quick way to do the detection. Maybe we should think about using pytorch's cpuinfo library (https://github.com/pytorch/cpuinfo).\r\n\r\n@tqchen @FrozenGene

now, storage scope information is scattered across different places. This PR proposes to make `storage_scope` in PointerType, introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8017, be the single source of truth. This enables each `Allocate`, `Store`, `Load` nodes to directly access its storage scope through its associated buffer variable, rather than via `attr::stroage_scope` + a map between `Var` and storage scope as currently done today (for example, https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/813136401a11a49d6c15e6013c34dd822a5c4ff6/src/tir/transforms/thread_storage_sync.cc#L341). \r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n* In `schedule_ops.cc`, attach storage scope information to `ProduceRealizeNode`, rather than creating `AttrStmt` with `tir::attr::realize_scope` scope.\r\n* In `schedule_postproc_to_primfunc.cc`, always create a new `Buffer` using storage scope information in `ProduceRealizeNode`. This ensures that `PointerType` associated with the new buffer has always storage scope information attached.\r\n* In transform passes and codegen classes, try to use storage scope information in `AllocateNode` directly, and remove `attr::storage_scope` and `attr::realize_scope` when they are no longer needed. \r\n\r\nBuilding on this PR, I'll send the following changes later:\r\n* Introduce a new storage scope of dynamic shared memory\r\n* Remove remaining use of `attr::storage_scope`\r\n* Remove storage scope in `Buffer` class

faced with the problem that if I incorrectly pass onnx opset parameter to the onnx frontend I am getting the error with some low level error trace without any hint related to incorrect opset. That was difficult to root the reason due to that.  That's likely a rare case since most of the time user will not pass opset and rely on converter to detect it. Still it worth to improve the logging to hint user in case of such a situation\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!
