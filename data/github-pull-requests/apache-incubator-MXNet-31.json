Description ##\r\nUpdates the CD pipeline to include the PyPI release\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdd the `list_ctx` method to gluon's `ParamDict` to get all the contexts used by the underlying parameters.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Add list_ctx to ParameterDict, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [X] Test for ParameterDict reset_ctx, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-17T11:03:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T20:00:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T20:00:50Z","merged_at":"2019-09-25T20:00:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"df34e768ed5d4dd334c0dce7ce42384d7b62ee8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4b817e2e48c394dfa92fbdda075aa0f709d0f5e4","head":{"label":"Kh4L:parameterdict_list_ctx","ref":"parameterdict_list_ctx","sha":"4b817e2e48c394dfa92fbdda075aa0f709d0f5e4","user":{"login":"Kh4L","id":3193578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L","html_url":"https://github.com/Kh4L","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185939764,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU5Mzk3NjQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Kh4L/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kh4L","id":3193578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L","html_url":"https://github.com/Kh4L","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kh4L/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-17T01:18:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T21:14:14Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T09:10:01Z","merged_at":"2019-11-19T09:10:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f14bf4fe51b586f86a1e7bd38b8282997e6ffbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/42d2ba94e25194935e10a31741258c36447e8f68","head":{"label":"wuxun-zhang:add_mkldnn_lts_ut","ref":"add_mkldnn_lts_ut","sha":"42d2ba94e25194935e10a31741258c36447e8f68","user":{"login":"wuxun-zhang","id":34727741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI3NzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34727741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163937530,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM5Mzc1MzA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"wuxun-zhang/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuxun-zhang","id":34727741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI3NzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34727741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nWe display a build status at the top of the README between the mxnet logo and the Portable, Efficient, Scalable graphics.

PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2019-09-16T22:21:48Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T20:33:29Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T20:33:29Z","merged_at":"2019-09-18T20:33:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"995b477d940bcba9927b34cd7bda8cabc85628a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/de80f2a0e27fc7af7489d0cb8fd2d3f190854d89","head":{"label":"zachgk:readbuild","ref":"readbuild","sha":"de80f2a0e27fc7af7489d0cb8fd2d3f190854d89","user":{"login":"zachgk","id":1329299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjkyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1329299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk","html_url":"https://github.com/zachgk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143360201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMzNjAyMDE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zachgk/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zachgk","id":1329299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjkyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1329299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk","html_url":"https://github.com/zachgk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zachgk/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nTry to add exception to avoid error-message downgrade issues reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16102\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-16T20:26:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T21:43:39Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T21:43:39Z","merged_at":"2019-09-18T21:43:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e058a31bcf565a2a7c868e6726ab77527513ee7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d473e9fcd66f0d6522214bb07370e655b11af408","head":{"label":"sxjscience:check_reshape_warning","ref":"check_reshape_warning","sha":"d473e9fcd66f0d6522214bb07370e655b11af408","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nRemoves mshadow implementation of argmax and add fresh implementation for it\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Performance Numbers ###\r\nMachine: \r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2686 v4 @ 2.30GHz\r\n32 Core\r\nL1d cache:

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nExtends CD pipeline to also produce the dynamically linked libmxnet and post it to the artifact repository.\r\n\r\n[Pipeline](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci-dev.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-pipeline/detail/mxnet-cd-pipeline/57/pipeline/30) works, with the exception of the python 2 tests for the CPU variant under the statically linked library. This is a known issue and unrelated to the pipeline here. Should be ok to merge, and the fix for the failing tests can be done in a different PR/effort.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nAs title, implementation detail is described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15928\r\n\r\n`mx.np.random.gamma()` outperforms `ndarray.random.gamma()` on GPU. Also, it supports broadcastable parameters. However, there exists some performance issues on **CPU**, more specifically, slower than native Numpy.\r\nI'm currently investigating into a proper implementation suitable for CPU backend. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

Description ##\r\nUpdate dmlc-core to latest, fix some CI issue during this update.\r\n@pengzhao-intel @szha \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-12T00:57:16Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T05:56:54Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T05:56:18Z","merged_at":"2019-09-16T05:56:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c136c9a312c40d642c13c36367ab4157ad91f81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d71c9846a0b78031e3e600b859ddf523a7dc87dd","head":{"label":"ZhennanQin:dmlc_update","ref":"dmlc_update","sha":"d71c9846a0b78031e3e600b859ddf523a7dc87dd","user":{"login":"ZhennanQin","id":39290748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjkwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39290748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhennanQin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137315010,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzczMTUwMTA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"ZhennanQin/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZhennanQin","id":39290748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjkwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39290748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhennanQin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZhennanQin/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nNightly tests are failing because libtvm.so is not there in Gluon estimator: GPU \r\nThis PR includes libtvm which is required for Gluon estimator: GPU  test\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T22:38:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T04:24:27Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T04:24:27Z","merged_at":"2019-09-12T04:24:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b42065c129e5ce80ad41a7839f21d25821f5667","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bd8bbee4e5aa4d4a05762a8a8a12fb831cc8bef1","head":{"label":"Vikas-kum:gluon_estimator_nightly_fix","ref":"gluon_estimator_nightly_fix","sha":"bd8bbee4e5aa4d4a05762a8a8a12fb831cc8bef1","user":{"login":"Vikas-kum","id":1817689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTc2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1817689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum","html_url":"https://github.com/Vikas-kum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161245350,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEyNDUzNTA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Vikas-kum/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Vikas-kum","id":1817689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTc2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1817689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum","html_url":"https://github.com/Vikas-kum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikas-kum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Vikas-kum/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is not set in most cases for the build instructions from source.\r\nIf the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is empty no optimization flags are used by default. This results not only in a higher memory footprint but also in a much slower binary compared to the official python MXNet pip packages. This PR adds the option `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` in the documentation as the default option. @zachgk @aaronmarkham\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n\r\n- [x] To the my best

changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

[ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T07:31:52Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T15:20:13Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:20:12Z","merged_at":"2019-09-11T15:20:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"c12c978aa0b1096e0153fbdc2355628ed6271c07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16139/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16139/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16139/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/cd8bf0990f21b67e35143540460c5f4223e9fba3","head":{"label":"reminisce:fix_sample_normal","ref":"fix_sample_normal","sha":"cd8bf0990f21b67e35143540460c5f4223e9fba3","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79397572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTM5NzU3Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"reminisce/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Testing ##\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_TEST_COUNT=1 nosetests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s

Description ##\r\nNumpy eye\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nFixes #16108\r\n\r\nSubgraph API can create duplicated tensors for both inputs to a subgraph and outputs from a subgraph. This happens when there are multiple nodes in a subgraph that consume the same input, or when there are multiple nodes that consume a single subgraph output. This results in tensor duplication, and causes OOM due to excessive memory usage.\r\n\r\n### Fix for duplicate inputs ###\r\nCurrently, inputs to a subgraph are duplicated when there are multiple nodes in a subgraph consuming the same input (see diagram below). In this PR we change the behavior of CutGraphInputs function to store a NodeEntry for each input to the subgraph in a map, and re-use that node for each node in the subgraph that consumes that input (see diagram below). This prevents input nodes from being duplicated, and results in less copies of tensors at runtime and a much smaller memory footprint.\r\n\r\n![duplicateInputs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1541993/74593591-a2747b00-4fe1-11ea-97c5-824a4c15705e.png)\r\n\r\n### Fix for duplicate outputs ###\r\nSimilar to the inputs, when an output from a subgraph is consumed by multiple nodes outside the subgraph, the output is duplicated for each consumer (see diagram below). In this PR we change the behavior of CreateSubgraphNode to collapse duplicate output dependencies to a single output by checking if neighboring output entries are the same. If so we do not add another output, preventing duplicates. \r\n\r\nThen in the ConnectSubgraphOutputs function we create dependencies from each node outside the subgraph that consumes a subgraph output. If neighboring nodes share the same subgraph output, they point to the same subgraph output.\r\n\r\n![duplicateOutputs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1541993/74593719-14998f80-4fe3-11ea-98f9-690fd3930844.png)\r\n\r\n### Example ###\r\nAdded an example graph with duplicate inputs/outputs to the `test_subgraph_op.py`. Heres the original graph partitioned before this PR. Notice that it has two input nodes: `data0` and `data1` that both come from the same top level `data`. Similarly, notice that it has two outputs coming from the same node `_plus0`.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"nodes\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"null\", \r\n      \"name\": \"data\", \r\n      \"attrs\": {\"__shape__\": \"(1,)\"}, \r\n      \"inputs\": []\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"_CachedOp\", \r\n      \"name\": \"_CachedOp0\", \r\n      \"inputs\": [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], \r\n      \"subgraphs\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"nodes\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"op\": \"null\", \r\n              \"name\": \"data0\", \r\n              \"inputs\": []\r\n            }, \r\n            {\r\n              \"op\": \"sin\", \r\n              \"name\": \"sin0\", \r\n              \"inputs\": [[0, 0, 0]]\r\n            }, \r\n            {\r\n              \"op\": \"null\", \r\n              \"name\": \"data1\", \r\n              \"inputs\": []\r\n            }, \r\n            {\r\n              \"op\": \"sin\", \r\n              \"name\": \"sin1\", \r\n              \"inputs\": [[2, 0, 0]]\r\n            }, \r\n            {\r\n              \"op\": \"elemwise_add\", \r\n              \"name\": \"_plus0\", \r\n              \"inputs\": [[1, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0]]\r\n            }\r\n          ], \r\n          \"arg_nodes\": [0, 2], \r\n          \"node_row_ptr\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], \r\n          \"heads\": [[4, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0]]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"cos\", \r\n      \"name\": \"cos0\", \r\n      \"inputs\": [[1, 0, 0]]\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"cos\", \r\n      \"name\": \"cos1\", \r\n      \"inputs\": [[1, 1, 0]]\r\n    }, \r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"elemwise_sub\", \r\n      \"name\": \"_minus0\", \r\n      \"inputs\": [[2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0]]\r\n    }\r\n  ], \r\n  \"arg_nodes\": [0], \r\n  \"node_row_ptr\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], \r\n  \"heads\": [[4, 0, 0]], \r\n  \"attrs\": {\"mxnet_version\": [\"int\", 10700]}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHeres the same graph partitioned after this PR. Notice that now there is only 1 input node `data0` and both `sin` ops use it. Also notice that now there is only 1 output from the subgraph, and both `cos` ops use it. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"nodes\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"null\", \r\n      \"name\": \"data\", \r\n

well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe CD pipeline is failing due to a load library test and compiling with CUDA v8.0 support.\r\nTo mitigate these issues, I've included an environment variable to signal CD builds to the tests, thus making it more flexible to skip unneeded tests. I've also dropped building the CUDA v8.0 variant and added the CUDA v10.1 variant.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nAdd a Fast implementation of LARS.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add multi_sum_sq Op: computing sum of squares of multiple arrays (1 sum per array).\r\n- Add multi_lars Op: computing LARS with the sum of squares of weights and gradients.\r\n- Add preloaded_multi_sgd which a version of SGD where learning rate are MXNet array instead of list of parameters.\r\n- Add SGDwFastLARS optimizer\r\n- Add test for the new Ops and optimizer.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis code have been used for MLPerf v0.6 benchmarks. It's especially pertinent if you are training with small local batch size as optimizers usually don't scale with batch size.\r\n\r\n## Credits ##\r\n- The CPU part is from @drivanov\r\n- As said in

Description ##\r\nAn error in Doc.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- The Doc of the function nn.Conv2DTranspose does not explain the input parameter 'padding' correctly. It is simply a copy of the part used in nn.Conv2D. You need to correct the meaning of padding.

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nImprove dataloader use experience.\r\nWith this PR, dataloaders are\r\n\r\n- More responsive to terminate with Ctrl + C\r\n- Show helpful messages if exceptions raises in multiple workers. DataLoaders used to produce unreadable messages.\r\n- Less likely to hang forever, given timeout is added to fetch logic\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2,

Description ##\r\nAs title\r\n\r\n@stu1130 I implemented a unified `_copy<xpu>' function in dist_common.h\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16109/files#diff-756e5043564af2ba47c700240749b31dR45\r\n\r\nwhich could be used to copy an indicator variable from device to host, you could probably make use of it in `multinomial`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nFaster 2D transpose\r\n\r\n## How to achieve this ##\r\n\r\nExisting implementation leverages mshadow's expression template.\r\nHowever, we found that there is no need for it and can be optimized.\r\n\r\nPrinciple behind this implementation is to derive maximum utilization from L1 cache. Most L1 caches will have cache size >= 32kb. Hence, the aim was to transpose the 2D matrix on a per block basis.\r\n\r\n### Block size calculation\r\nTotal size (to be utilized) = 32kb (2^15)\r\nLargest size of a single unit of any dtype <= 8 byte (2^3)\r\nNumber of elements - 2^12 (2^15/2^3)\r\nBlock-size - 2^6 v 2^6 (64 v 64)\r\n\r\nBut we could leverage unrolling of for loops (for parallelization)\r\nBlock-size - 2^5 v 2^5 (32 v 32) with 4 pragma for loop unrolled\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this

Description ##\r\nThis PR implements an infra to let users dispatch the execution of a tvm operator to different schedules according to the runtime input shapes. This helps with acceleration. \r\n\r\nA gemm example can be found in\r\n- Kernel definition: contrib/tvmop/core/multiarray.py\r\n- Operator registry and dispatch: src/operator/contrib/tvmop/dot.cc\r\n- Benchmark: benchmark/python/tvmop/benchmark_tvmop.py\r\n\r\nThe following are some experimental results for matrix multiplication between two n * n matrix. Note that benchmark results cannot be reproduced until [this](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3842) gets merged.\r\n\r\n| n  | After Dispatch (ms) | Before Dispatch (ms) |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1024  | 177 | 482 |\r\n| 1056  | 190 | 366 |\r\n| 1088 | 200 | 424 |\r\n\r\nThe example schedule is roughly equivalent to the [Blocking](https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/optimize/opt_gemm.html) optimization. More opt (like vectorization, loop permutation, array packing, write cache for blocks, parallel) can be used for further acceleration.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nThis PR implemented NumPy's [array ufunc](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html) and [array function](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html) protocols so that `mxnet.numpy.ndarray` can be fed into a subset of official NumPy operators and get dispatched to the corresponding MXNet operators for execution. See the following for examples.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nimport numpy as onp  # the official NumPy's version must be >= 1.17\r\nfrom mxnet import np as mx_np\r\n\r\na = mx_np.random.uniform(size=(1, 3))\r\nb = mx_np.random.uniform(size=(2, 1))\r\nassert type(onp.concatenate([a, a])) == mx_np.ndarray\r\nassert type(onp.sum(a)) == mx_np.ndarray\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAs title\r\nhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.1/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Uniform/Weighted sampling with/without replacement implemented.\r\n- [x] Allow input to be array/symbol. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Weighted sampling has some performance issues currently, as TopK used in weighted sample without replacement is implemented using `sort`.\r\n\r\n- Heavily referenced from

Description ##\r\nWhile setting up the repository on my local machine, I came across some instructions that were out of date:\r\n\r\n- Building everything from source was recommended if you want to make changes to any of the code, but I understand from the `mxnet` Slack channel that using the nightly snapshots of the Scala package jar is adequate for making changes to the Clojure code.\r\n- Updating the `project.clj` file was part of the instructions for building everything from source, but this is no longer necessary.\r\n- Similarly the `project.clj` file lists `[org.apache.mxnet/mxnet-full_2.11 \"INTERNAL\"]` as used for `CI` builds, when it is also used for local builds of the Scala package jar.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates those instructions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Update the Clojure package's

changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nIntegrate `LeakyRelu` operator with MKL-DNN activation primitives when the `act_type` is `leakyrelu` and `elu`(gelu will be available when #16073 is ready)\r\n\r\nMain Change:\r\n- Register `LeakyRelu` operator with NNVM.\r\n- Share MKL-DNN integration code with `Activation` operator.\r\n- Support mkl-dnn `elu` and `leakyrelu`.\r\n- Support `conv + leakyrelu` fusion and quantization, which appears as a common structure in darknet and yolov3.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFixes #16021. The static build fails with openblas v0.3.5, this PR bumps it to v0.3.7, which seems to work. Also, fixes error checking in the openblas installation to ensure errors will make CI fail.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-01T17:05:00Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T19:56:58Z","closed_at":"2019-09-07T19:56:58Z","merged_at":"2019-09-07T19:56:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ff1d8794c432142999199df77963ace161ff493","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/86aa53efd56748a69ae002fe66fee339d977b446","head":{"label":"perdasilva:openblas_static_build_fix","ref":"openblas_static_build_fix","sha":"86aa53efd56748a69ae002fe66fee339d977b446","user":{"login":"perdasilva","id":785683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143983733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM5ODM3MzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"perdasilva/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"perdasilva","id":785683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nTarget the mkldnn-v1.0 feature branch, not the master branch.\r\nEnable base code in ndarray.cc/.h and mkldnn_base.cc/-inl.h with the new APIs in MKL-DNN v1.0.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-01T14:13:03Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T02:41:53Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T02:41:53Z","merged_at":"2019-09-10T02:41:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0cbc92ed89b1f932d9a7b3b5f764f68f5099386","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f4cc0a7582dd9a5fd362f2832d34d20ba5edd6f7","head":{"label":"TaoLv:v1.0/base-code","ref":"v1.0/base-code","sha":"f4cc0a7582dd9a5fd362f2832d34d20ba5edd6f7","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_adm

to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-01T08:34:40Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T07:11:54Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T07:11:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59fa7f93308344788299a34a98e48513a1e0ef55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/0b18d6b87706c846dcbfd276d1f3f6bdd0b35280","head":{"label":"JiadingGai:v1.4.x","ref":"v1.4.x","sha":"0b18d6b87706c846dcbfd276d1f3f6bdd0b35280","user":{"login":"JiadingGai","id":4014457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTQ0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4014457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai","html_url":"https://github.com/JiadingGai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205649314,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU2NDkzMTQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"JiadingGai/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JiadingGai","id":4014457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTQ0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4014457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai","html_url":"https://github.com/JiadingGai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JiadingGai/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

patch extends mxnet.model.load_checkpoint to support loading from saved graphs with empty weights. Weightless graphs can arise from several scenarios; e.g., graphs that only contain mxnet.ndarray ops such as repeat, reshape etc. The feature is quite useful in testing each individual component of a large neural network.

fix.","created_at":"2019-09-01T08:30:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T23:26:37Z","closed_at":"2019-11-26T23:26:02Z","merged_at":"2019-11-26T23:26:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b00b2ca2a9aa9df30e8f2bd5274ba9b0df24d03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16061/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16061/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16061/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9ef43e679a11ec26cdbb243add0240d7a0ac7a58","head":{"label":"JiadingGai:master","ref":"master","sha":"9ef43e679a11ec26cdbb243add0240d7a0ac7a58","user":{"login":"JiadingGai","id":4014457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTQ0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4014457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai","html_url":"https://github.com/JiadingGai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205649314,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU2NDkzMTQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"JiadingGai/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JiadingGai","id":4014457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTQ0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4014457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai","html_url":"https://github.com/JiadingGai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiadingGai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JiadingGai/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis fixes a flaky integration test from the Clojure package that was discovered in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15889#issuecomment-526698102. \r\n\r\nDisabled the file test check because of the timing of the file creation was leading to flaky test results. Also removed unused test json file\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-31T15:30:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-08T03:25:18Z","closed_at":"2019-09-01T19:26:11Z","merged_at":"2019-09-01T19:26:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"36bab1c39db4088ee61fb3a8f733bd33b3b34de3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6ce48b2db8ce22c4c2e9b7b006b37d647e05f0d9","head":{"label":"apache:fix-flaky-clojure-profiler-test","ref":"fix-flaky-clojure-profiler-test","sha":"6ce48b2db8ce22c4c2e9b7b006b37d647e05f0d9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
