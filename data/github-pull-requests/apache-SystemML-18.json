PR will serve as placeholder for discussion, so please donot merge.\r\n\r\n- This PR doesnot resolve SYSTEMML-1583 as it still requires [caffe](https://github.com/niketanpansare/incubator-systemml/blob/prep_caffemodel/src/main/python/systemml/converters.py#L53) to be installed.\r\n- This PR converts the numpy array from caffemode directly to MatrixBlock. This works well if the array is reasonably small, but if the array is very large, then it could take long time due to P4J (~45 seconds for converting VGG model to MatrixBlocks). Also, this approach requires large driver memory.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pyspark --driver-memory 10g\r\nfrom systemml.mllearn import Caffe2DML\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\r\nimport numpy as

our `nn` library, our convolution and pooling layers have to pass\r\naround the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the images that are\r\nstretched out into rows of the input/output matrices.  These output\r\ndimensions are computed within the forward functions of the above\r\nlayers as small scalar equations.  From a mathematical standpoint,\r\nthese sizes can be determined at compile time, and it is nice to have\r\nthese size equations in DML (v.s. hiding them inside the engine within\r\nbuilt-in functions).  However, we do not currently evaluate these\r\nexpressions during compilation, and thus we are left with unknown sizes\r\neven during recompilation.  This naturally leads to max memory estimates\r\nand thus often leads to unnecessary distributed runtime ops rather than\r\nsimple CP ones.\r\n\r\nEssentially, this commit fixes that issue by rerunning static rewrites\r\n\\+ IPA again immediately after the initial IPA pass as a kind of \"second\r\nchance\".  By doing this, we're able to apply this constant folding\r\nrewrite for this scenario.  This make sense because during the initial\r\nstatic rewrite pass, we can't apply constant folding to the `Hout`,\r\n`Wout`, etc. DAGs due to the leaf nodes being scalar transient reads.\r\nAfter IPA with the new scalar replacement, these DAGs will consist\r\nentirely of operations on literal leaf nodes, and thus will be eligible\r\nfor constant folding.  Then, after that second pass of static rewrites,\r\nwe can benefit from IPA again by being able to now perform scalar\r\nreplacement for functions/other DAGs that consume the `Hout`, `Wout`,\r\netc. DAGs, which are now

`nn` library contains it's own DML test suite for gradient checks\r\nand unit tests that produces \"ERROR: ...\" messages if any of the\r\nmathematical operations return incorrect results.  Note that this has\r\nhelped to find mathematical bugs in the library & engine that do not\r\nresult in JVM exceptions.  This commit simply adds a Java test harness\r\nthat wraps these DML tests, parsing the standard out for \"ERROR:\"\r\nmessages.  A new `scripts` test package has been created, with the aim\r\nof eventually testing all of our DML algorithms.  Additionally, the\r\nParserWrapper has been updated to look in the `scripts` folder as a\r\nfallback, which allows for easy testing of our actual scripts.","created_at":"2017-04-27T19:42:05Z","updated_at":"2017-04-29T00:57:32Z","closed_at":"2017-04-29T00:57:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9ef14789c76d942f4d3daaa42d9befaae603f79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/f67b0bdf6412583d732ee7428bf554a5c12a39c5","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:SYSTEMML-1564_nn_java_test_suite","ref":"SYSTEMML-1564_nn_java_test_suite","sha":"f67b0bdf6412583d732ee7428bf554a5c12a39c5","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

during IPA we collect all variables (scalars & matrices)\r\neligible for propagation across blocks (i.e. not updated in block), and\r\nthen propagate the only the matrix sizes across the blocks. It seems\r\nplausible that we could also replace all eligible scalar transient reads\r\nwith literals based on the variables that have already been collected.\r\nThe benefit is that many ops will be able to determine their respective\r\noutput sizes during regular compilation, instead of having to wait until\r\ndynamic recompilation, and thus we can reduce the pressure on dynamic\r\nrecompilation.\r\n\r\nAre there drawbacks to this approach?  The use case is that I was seeing a large number of memory warnings while training a convolutional net due to the sizes being unknown during regular compilation, yet the engine only having CP versions of the ops.  Additionally, I was running into actual heap space OOM errors for situations that should not run out of memory, and thus I started exploring.\r\n\r\nI've attached an example script and the explain plan (hops & runtime) w/ and w/o the IPA scalar replacement to the associated JIRA issue.\r\n\r\ncc @mboehm7

calculation of the output sizes (`Hout`, `Wout`) for conv2d and\r\nmax_pool2d layers rely on a flooring operation to only allow for valid\r\noperations.  Previously, we simply relied on the `as.integer` call to\r\nimplicitly perform this flooring operation during truncation of the\r\ndouble to an integer.  While this gave the correct results, it was less\r\nreadable than it should be, and relied on truncation behavior rather\r\nthan explicit mathematical behavior.  This commit simply adds an\r\nexplicit `floor` operation to each calculation.","created_at":"2017-04-12T21:36:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T21:49:59Z","closed_at":"2017-04-12T21:49:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13880ec54fd0a4ac440e0d36bf0f122dde85d9fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/9bf09fd4698f3d3afe4c0851fc0fbc8b2aa9ec2b","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:SYSTEMML-1516","ref":"SYSTEMML-1516","sha":"9bf09fd4698f3d3afe4c0851fc0fbc8b2aa9ec2b","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

commit adds a new batch normalization layer, `batch_norm`, and a\r\nnew spatial batch normalization layer, `spatial_batch_norm`.\r\n\r\nThe batch normalization layer uses the per-feature sample mean and\r\nper-feature uncorrected sample variance during training to\r\nnormalize each feature of the input data.\r\n\r\nThe spatial batch normalization layer uses the per-channel sample mean\r\nand per-channel uncorrected sample variance during training to\r\nnormalize each channel of the input data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these layers introduce learnable parameters (gamma, beta)\r\nto control the amount of normalization.\r\n\r\n   y = ((x-mean) / sqrt(var+eps)) * gamma + beta\r\n\r\nFinally, these implementations maintain exponential moving averages of\r\nthe mean and variance during training for use during testing.","created_at":"2017-03-29T22:42:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T21:38:49Z","closed_at":"2017-03-30T21:38:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc84287ea69e8900cfd93660ae13576dd2ebbe24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/ed4ce20b22ea411a1b03cf368de2e0ee88b150fd","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:SYSTEMML-1409_SYSTEMML-1410_batch_norm","ref":"SYSTEMML-1409_SYSTEMML-1410_batch_norm","sha":"ed4ce20b22ea411a1b03cf368de2e0ee88b150fd","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

order to exploit a multi-GPU setup, this implements synchronous\r\ndistributed SGD.  More specifically, this (1) sets the degree of\r\nparallelism (hardcoded for now), (2) adjusts the inner `for` loop\r\n(previously for iterations) to extract out groups of mini-batches,\r\nwhere the number of mini-batches is equal to the degree of parallelism,\r\n(3) adds an inner `parfor` to parallelize the computation of gradients\r\nover a group of mini-batches (i.e. one mini-batch per GPU) and store\r\nthe gradients, and (4) updates the model after the `parfor` loop using\r\nthe aggregated (averaged) gradients.\r\n\r\nTo run, follow the instructions
