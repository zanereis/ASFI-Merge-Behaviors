sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2867\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Dictionary creation should be written by dictionary literal\r\n- Python’s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called (like it is in say, Ruby). This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you will and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.\r\n- Functions calling sets which can be replaced by set literal are now replaced by set literal\r\n- Replace list literals\r\n- Some of the static methods haven't been set static\r\n- Remove redundant parentheses\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nN/a, Nothing new added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T20:17:22Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T18:14:26Z","closed_at":"2018-08-07T23:18:43Z","merged_at":"2018-08-07T23:18:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"120f4856cdea5134971c4c4a239ddbfdc80db77e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c3b5ea1a3f14df9fa1d62bc8fec7706605ff5096","head":{"label":"kaxil:code-cleaning","ref":"code-cleaning","sha":"c3b5ea1a3f14df9fa1d62bc8fec7706605ff5096","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the tests for `airflow/hooks/druid_hook.py` and also adds an assert so that `timeout` must be greater than or equal to 1 second. This should fix the failing build in #3707.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI ran `nosetests /tests/hooks/test_druid_hook.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2861\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDelete dag functionality is added in v1-10-stable, whose implementation during the metadata cleanup part, look for classes which has attribute named as dag_id and then formulate the query on matching model and then delete from metadata, we've few numbers where we've observed slowness especially in log table because it doesn't have any single or multiple-column index. Creating an index would boost the performance though insertion will be a bit slower. Since deletion will be a sync call, would be good idea to create index.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2857\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPer the mailing list thread \"Readthedocs is Broken\" on Aug 5, 2018, the Read the Docs build process is currently broken per the recent addition of https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3660.\r\n\r\nThe [RTD build environment](http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/builds.html#build-environment) provides a `READTHEDOCS` env var boolean which it sets to true.  I have used that to toggle on `SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE` only when that env var is supplied to restrict it to that environment.\r\n\r\nRelated change: The mock module [is used in conf.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/3157287e8c1aba7649cb7de80dd4026666889725/docs/conf.py#L16) is supplied to Sphinx to build the docs, but it was missing from the `doc` install extra in setup.py, so I've added that.\r\n\r\nHere's how I tested this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install -e .[doc]  # (fails)\r\n\r\nREADTHEDOCS=True pip install -e .[doc]  # (succeeds)\r\n\r\ncd docs/\r\n./build.sh\r\n./start_doc_server.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nA successful build on https://readthedocs.org/projects/airflow/builds/ will confirm that this is working in the Read the Docs environment.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-06T02:50:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-12T18:22:02Z","closed_at":"2018-08-07T14:20:31Z","merged_at":"2018-08-07T14:20:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"8af0aa96bfe3caa51d67ab393db069d37b0c4169","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7007e9576e0d15713198fa6a1ef469a5a9fb42e1","head":{"label":"tedmiston:read-the-docs-gpl","ref":"read-the-docs-gpl","sha":"7007e9576e0d15713198fa6a1ef469a5a9fb42e1","user":{"login":"tedmiston","id":366688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston","html_url":"https://github.com/tedmiston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"aa7b25b6afc069077c3e42ab13ef2de3efa7d4fc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2856\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSetting up a local docker test environment was breaking due to the additional of the [verify_gpl_dependency](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/setup.py#L39\r\n) in setup.py. This PR fixes that by passing in the SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes env to `docker run`\r\n\r\nIt also now uses the -w arg on `docker run` in order to put user directly into /airflow dir. This removes the need to `cd` into that directory in the next step.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nWho will test the tests?\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-05T20:44:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T21:46:42Z","closed_at":"2018-08-08T11:49:44Z","merged_at":"2018-08-08T11:49:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"8687ab9271b7b93473584a720f225f20fa9a7aa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fab2e7e22f8f7ae23bb091017388222a2ea5cca1","head":{"label":"astronomer:update-docker-docs-to-account-for-verify-gpl-dep-change","ref":"update-docker-docs-to-account-for-verify-gpl-dep-change","sha":"fab2e7e22f8f7ae23bb091017388222a2ea5cca1","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2855\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`schedule_interval` of DAGs can either be timedelta or a Cron expression.\r\n\r\nWhen it's a Cron expression, there is no mechanism to check its validity at this moment. If there is anything wrong with the Cron expression itself, it will cause issues when methods `following_schedule()`  and `previous_schedule()` are invoked (will affect scheduling).\r\n\r\nHowever, exceptions will only be written into logs. From Web UI, it’s hard for users to identify this issue & the source while no new task can be initiated (especially for users who’re not very familiar with Cron).\r\n\r\n It may be good to show error messages in web UI when a DAG's Cron expression (as schedule_interval) can not be parsed by `croniter` properly (this is implemented by adding these exceptions into metadata `import_error`, whose entries will be shown as error messages in web UI).\r\n\r\nRelated tests are added as well.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot**\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-05 at 10 23 46 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/43687000-0ced5a5e-9901-11e8-85ba-b1d8ce0fce9f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-05T14:45:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T02:21:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-08T01:07:43Z","merged_at":"2018-08-08T01:07:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"d47580feaf80eeebb416d0179dfa8db3f4e1d2c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1a5936fa3274d1009657aa89f95c874f21eb98ef","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:patch-6","ref":"patch-6","sha":"1a5936fa3274d1009657aa89f95c874f21eb98ef","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

Remove legacy imports support for plugins\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP since the tests on master aren't passing locally on my machine (5 out of 8 for `./run_unit_tests.sh  ./tests/plugins_manager.py` pass), I'll drop the WIP if this passes CI.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests for plugins.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-03T23:20:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-06T03:58:40Z","closed_at":"2018-09-06T03:58:39Z","merged_at":"2018-09-06T03:58:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"e765a0315c2df7117ed38057204749db5fc897c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/04ced7f0e0b35f820802cc8b6bc0c405d350bd49","head":{"label":"holdenk:AIRFLOW-2847-remove-deprecated-plugin-import-support","ref":"AIRFLOW-2847-remove-deprecated-plugin-import-support","sha":"04ced7f0e0b35f820802cc8b6bc0c405d350bd49","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104391480,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzOTE0ODA=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"holdenk/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2843\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n`ExternalTaskSensor` will keep waiting (given restrictions of retries, poke_interval, etc), even if the external task specified doesn't exist at all. In some cases, this waiting may still make sense as new DAG may backfill.\r\n\r\nBut it may be good to provide an option to cease waiting immediately if the external task specified doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\nProvide an argument `check_existence`. Set to `True` to check if the external task exists, and immediately cease waiting if the external task does not exist.\r\n\r\n**The default value is set to `False` (no check or ceasing will happen), so it will not affect any existing DAGs or user expectation.**\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 2805](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2805) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR implements multiple timezones for task instances. By default it will display UTC and User's local timezone. If the DAG's timezone is different from UTC and User's Local Timezone, then the tooltip will also display the third timezone i.e., DAG's timezone. \r\nThis includes the new JS library momentJS, which also replaces the hard-coded JQClock.js file from the code base. (The clock in the navigation also uses momentJS now)\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-02 at 2 11 14 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43608339-23803d84-96a1-11e8-9fb1-f5877214df8e.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-02 at 2 11 39 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43608341-23ad786c-96a1-11e8-849e-29239859045b.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-02 at 3 30 29 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43608353-2c62726e-96a1-11e8-9368-391811783efb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt only affects JS files, and we don't have any tests for JS code yet.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2839\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe can define connections either in metadata database or environment variables.\r\n \r\n**However, how about there are connections with the same `conn_id` in both *metadata database* and *environment variables*? Will one of them be picked? Which one? Or a random one will be picked?**\r\n \r\nThe answer is: Airflow will check environment variables first (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/hooks/base_hook.py#L70). The \"random picking\" mechanism will only be applicable for multiple connections with the same conn_id in metadata database (if there is no connection with the same conn_id defined in environment variables).\r\n \r\nThis should be made clear in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-02T02:10:46Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T01:48:20Z","closed_at":"2018-08-05T18:08:16Z","merged_at":"2018-08-05T18:08:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0c63ae2a495b8f808c36acc35d752e916393954","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9e1866c9b16894a19aee6ee36df8f8145b09341b","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"9e1866c9b16894a19aee6ee36df8f8145b09341b","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2836\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nThe default `fs_conn_id` in `contrib.sensors.FileSensor` is 'fs_default2'. However, when we initiate the database (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/utils/db.py#L88), there isn't such an entry. It doesn't exist anywhere else.\r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\n\r\nThe purpose of `contrib.sensors.FileSensor` is mainly for checking local file system (of course can also be used for NAS). Then the path (\"/\") from default connection 'fs_default' would suffice.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the default value for fs_conn_id in contrib.sensors.FileSensor is \"fs_default2\" (a value doesn't exist), it will make the situation much more complex. \r\n\r\nWhen users intend to check local file system only, they should be able to leave fs_conn_id default directly, instead of going setting up another connection separately.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\nChange default value for `fs_conn_id` in `contrib.sensors.FileSensor` from \"fs_default2\" to \"fs_default\" (actually in the related test, the `fs_conn_id` are all specified to be \"fs_default\").\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2832\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- Inspired by other recent issues related to linter errors in Python and JS (AIRFLOW-2783, AIRFLOW-2800, AIRFLOW-2803)\r\n- This PR does a few things:\r\n  - Resolves linter errors in markdown files across the project (ignores errors that aren't super useful on GitHub such as line wrapping and putting `<urls>` in brackets)\r\n  - Clarifies that commit message length of 50 characters doesn't include the Jira issue tag\r\n  - Replaces usage of JIRA with Jira the way it's styled nowadays by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software))\r\n  - Makes code block formatting consistent\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are restricted to linting documentation.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira]\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1298\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn my operations team, it is necessary to clear all tasks in one command line (because of so many schedules should be reprocessed cause of some reasons)\r\nBut, 'clear -cdf ...' is only clearing failed tasks without upstream_failed. It is not fit for our operator's needs.\r\nSo, I want to add new options to clear failed or upstream_failed jobs all at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1. clear only one schedule of this task : airflow clear -cp -s 2018-07-22T05:00:00 -e 2018-07-22T05:00:00 -t ^task_name$ schedule_name\r\n2. clear only multiple schedules of this task : airflow clear -cp -s 2018-07-22T05:00:00 -e 2018-07-22T09:00:00 -t ^task_name$ schedule_name\r\n3. clear multiple schedules of this task with downstream : airflow clear -cdp -s 2018-07-22T05:00:00 -e 2018-07-22T09:00:00 -t ^task_name$ schedule_name\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nnew option of clear command\r\noption is 'p' of upstream_failed's p character.\r\nUsage sample is like below :\r\nairflow clear -cdp -s 2018-07-22T05:00:00 -e 2018-07-22T09:00:00 -t ^task_name$ schedule_name\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2670\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously the SSH operator was not respecting the passed in timeout to the operator. Changed the Operator to pass the timeout to hook, as well as add a test to make sure the hook is being created correctly.\r\n\r\nExtension of #3553, mistakenly closed after I thought it was fixed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2780) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] My PR adds the feature to be able to interact with a mail server via the IMAP Protocol. It exposes the following methods:\r\n- `has_mail_attachment`: Can be used in a `Sensor` to poke the mail server for attachments with the given name and returns True if at least one has been found and False if not.\r\n- `retrieve_mail_attachments`: Can be used in an `Operator` to do sth. with the attachments returned as list of tuple (filename, payload).\r\n- `download_mail_attachments`: Can be used in an `Operator` to download the attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- `test_connect_and_disconnect`: this tests calls the ImapHook as ContextManager and so it tests for both (on enter/connect and on exit/disconnect)\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_found`\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_not_found`\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_with_regex_found`\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_with_regex_not_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_not_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_with_regex_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_with_regex_not_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_latest_only`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_not_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_with_regex_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_with_regex_not_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_with_latest_only`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2814\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### Backgrond\r\nIn https://github.com/XD-DENG/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs.py#L592 , it was mentioned the default value of argument `file_process_interval` should be 3 minutes (`file_process_interval`: Parse and schedule each file no faster than this interval).\r\n\r\nThe value is normally parsed from the default configuration `min_file_process_interval`. However, in the default config_template, its value is 0 rather than 180 seconds (https://github.com/XD-DENG/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/config_templates/default_airflow.cfg#L432 ). \r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\nThis means that actually that each file is parsed and scheduled without letting Airflow \"rest\". This conflicts with the design purpose (by default let it be 180 seconds) and may affect performance significantly.\r\n\r\n#### My Proposal\r\nChange the value in the config template from 0 to 180.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-28T03:24:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T23:21:16Z","closed_at":"2018-07-28T19:49:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da178154ff3b0799fa5749de7d61533f6ed392a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/77cdc5d5708133344951a6c9f848d8b1b3e2223d","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:patch-3","ref":"patch-3","sha":"77cdc5d5708133344951a6c9f848d8b1b3e2223d","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2524\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - This PR allows user to start a Amazon SageMaker Training job using the SageMakerCreateTrainingJobOperotar\r\n    - User can also check the progress(state) of the training job through the SageMakerTrainingSensor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n     - tests/contrib/hooks/test_sagemaker_hook.py\r\n     - tests/contrib/operators/test_sagemaker_create_training_job_operator.py\r\n     - tests/contrib/sensors/test_sagemaker_base_sensor.py\r\n     - tests/contrib/sensors/test_sagemaker_training_sensor.py\r\n      \r\nMoto Library does not support SageMaker, so the tests in this PR are done with unittest.mock library. Since most AWS services in Airflow use Moto for unit test, new PRs to update unit tests may be sent if Moto supports SageMaker in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-27T23:05:44Z","updated_at":"2018-08-12T18:03:44Z","closed_at":"2018-08-12T18:03:44Z","merged_at":"2018-08-12T18:03:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d2f83b19af3489d6c9563d51210a3dab2f38b26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2ef4f6f4829d114d21adbebfc59e8b45378ebb86","head":{"label":"troychen728:SageMaker_Airflow","ref":"SageMaker_Airflow","sha":"2ef4f6f4829d114d21adbebfc59e8b45378ebb86","user":{"login":"troychen728","id":16945941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ1OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16945941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728","html_url":"https://github.com/troychen728","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138648563,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg2NDg1NjM=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"troychen728/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"troychen728","id":16945941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ1OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16945941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728","html_url":"https://github.com/troychen728","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troychen728/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/troychen728/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nError in Updating.md directions under Logging Configuration having too many brackets results in errors:\r\n\r\n- log_filename_template\r\n- log_processor_filename_template\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis is changing documentation so updating tests are not needed\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\nThis does not relate to anything I

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2809\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nCurrently there is a configuration item **secret_key** in the configuration .cfg file, with a default value \"temporary_key\".\r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\n**Most admins would ignore it and just use the default value \"temporary_key\". However, this may be very dangerous. User may modify the cookie if they try the default SECRET_KEY while the admin didn't change it.**\r\n\r\n**In Flask documentation, it's suggested to have a SECRET_KEY which is as random as possible (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/ ). **\r\n\r\n#### My Proposal\r\nIf Admin explicitly changed the SECRET_KEY in **.cfg** file, we use this SECRET_KEY given by Admin.\r\n\r\nIf the default SECRET_KEY is not changed in **.cfg** file, randomly generate SECRET_KEY. Meanwhile, print INFO to remind that a randomly generated SECRET_KEY is used.\r\n\r\nThis solution will not affect user experience at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2808\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nA plugin duplication checking was designed in `plugins_manager.py` https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/plugins_manager.py#L93  .\r\n\r\nCorresponding commit was https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/3f38dec9bf44717a275412d1fe155e8252e45ee5    \r\n\r\nHowever, it turns out that this checking is not really working (***reason: plugin method object name is formed using plugin file path + plugin file name + Plugin Class name. It will never be duplicated given there will not be two files with the same name in the same directory***).\r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\n\r\nIn my production environment, there are two plugin files with the same name and operator names in the new AirflowPlugin classes defined inside. However, they passed the check without any warning or exception.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a plugin `file_sensor_1.py` as below, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.plugins_manager import AirflowPlugin\r\nfrom airflow.operators.sensors import BaseSensorOperator\r\nfrom airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nclass local_file_sensor(BaseSensorOperator):\r\n    @apply_defaults\r\n    def __init__(self, file_path, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super(local_file_sensor, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        self.file_path = file_path\r\n\r\n    def poke(self, context):\r\n        self.log.info('A-Poking: %s', self.file_path)\r\n        return os.path.exists(self.file_path)\r\n\r\nclass AirflowLocalFileSensorPlugin(AirflowPlugin):\r\n    name = \"local_file_sensor_plugin\"\r\n    operators = [local_file_sensor]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI copy & paste it into another plugin file `file_sensor_2.py`, and make the only change to change the log info from \"A-Poking\" to \"B-Poking\" (to help me check which one is picked).\r\n\r\nOnly one plugin would be loaded eventually (because the earlier loaded one will be overwritten by the later loaded one https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/plugins_manager.py#L101 ). However, which one? We don't know. It's indeterminate. So far the file name seems to be the only factor affecting which one would be picked by Airflow.\r\n\r\n#### My Proposal\r\n\r\nGive WARNING to the users when they launch the Airflow, if there is duplicated plugins.\r\n(**Or should we give error msg and fail the launching?**) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2798\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf `email_on_failure` or `email_on_failure` set to TRUE and email available, there will be email sent out on event of retry or failure.\r\n\r\nIn the implementation, there is a argument `is_retry` passed to method `self.email_alert`, which helps send out email eventually. However, inside this method, this argument `is_retry` is not used in any way at all. I believe the initial author of this method was planning to differentiate the email to be sent out, but for whatever reason this was not implemented eventually.\r\n\r\nGiven the email to be sent out will give a line \"**Try {try_number} out of {max_tries}**\", it would be fine not to differentiate **retry email** and **failure email**.\r\n\r\nSo I'm proposing to remove the `is_retry` argument from the method and its invocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe change I made only affect the functions in this single script (`airflow/models.py`). It will not affect the existing test units as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nI am willing to create a JIRA issue, but this is just a code quality fix PR and that seems excessive\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces `flake8 airflow` from 466 to 266 errors mostly through resolving of \r\n\r\n- E226\r\n- W291\r\n\r\nas well as __some__ E501 (line too long) where it did not risk reducing readability\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nOnly fixes flake8 errors\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\nIt does not pass as there are other linting errors on some of the files I touched that I was not comfortable changing at this

title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWith the change implemented in this PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3634 we managed to upgrade the DagreD3 package and that package can now be managed using npm and webpack. I also removed the hard-coded file DagreD3 from the code base but forgot to remove one statement using that file, which is restricting the frontend to build. This PR fixes that issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-24T11:57:54Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T12:42:00Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T12:16:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14df12eff11601358727866fcbcc4e7a8478d55b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a1fbdf21fd1f37b0f846e2cd90e4fba3b4d06932","head":{"label":"verdan:AIRFLOW-2782-dagred3-fix","ref":"AIRFLOW-2782-dagred3-fix","sha":"a1fbdf21fd1f37b0f846e2cd90e4fba3b4d06932","user":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137076822,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcwNzY4MjI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"verdan/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/verdan/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 2782](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2782) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2782\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nUpgraded the DagreD3 version to 0.4.18 (which is the last supported version of d3v3). The renderer and the initialization process is different from the current version (which I believe is 0.2.x). It also comes up with minor UI changes. I tried to keep the design same as the existing UI. This PR also standardized the highlighting of the nodes which were not consistent before. \r\n\r\n![dagre-d3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43125614-d6d58cdc-8f2a-11e8-9189-eaf9d5b0209a.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo updates here, as we don't have any frontend tests at the moment. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-24T08:23:53Z","updated_at":"2018-07-24T11:46:57Z","closed_at":"2018-07-24T09:23:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"976c7c80e89b15f447c3e37d09c41cd1e8de48e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6db3f6a9ce9f2ebdc44640a583e7dd5b40f86459","head":{"label":"verdan:AIRFLOW-2782-upgrade-dagre-d3","ref":"AIRFLOW-2782-upgrade-dagre-d3","sha":"6db3f6a9ce9f2ebdc44640a583e7dd5b40f86459","user":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137076822,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcwNzY4MjI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"verdan/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/verdan/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2780) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] My PR adds a feature to retrieve email attachments from a mail server via the IMAP Protocol.\r\n- `has_mail_attachments`: Can be used in a `Sensor` to check if there is an attachment on the mail server with the given name.\r\n- `retrieve_mail_attachments`: Can be used in an `Operator` to do sth. with the attachments returned as list of tuple.\r\n- `download_mail_attachments`: Can be used in an `Operator` to download the attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- `test_connect_and_disconnect`: this tests calls the ImapHook as ContextManager\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_found`\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_not_found`\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_with_regex_found`\r\n- `test_has_mail_attachments_with_regex_not_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_not_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_with_regex_found`\r\n- `test_retrieve_mail_attachments_with_regex_not_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_not_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_with_regex_found`\r\n- `test_download_mail_attachments_with_regex_not_found`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2787\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - `is_backfill` will fail with a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'` error when called on a DagRun with NULL `run_id` (allowed by model definition). This PR introduces a None check to prevent the crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - extension to `test_is_backfill` to check the NULL run_id case\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ x ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ x ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously we left it up to user to manage connections with mongo hook, this change moves that logic to the hook via context manager entry and exit points. This gives the user the added ability of being able to use `with` statements to manager connections while not breaking backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ x ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test to ensure context management is working as expected\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ x ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ x ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ x ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2765\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFrom https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2765:\r\nAssuming we would want both EmailOperator() and utils.email.send_email() to use the same default value for the mime_charset parameter.  The default for utils.email.send_email() was recently changed to UTF-8.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - Simple change of a default parameter.\r\n    - Existing unit tests in `tests/operators/test_email_operator.py` pass.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI run the following test to make sure there are no import errors in our CI. After upgrading to 1.10-stable from 1.9.0, the following test starting failing: \r\n```python\r\nclass TestAirflowDag:\r\n\r\n    def test_dagbag_import(self):\r\n        \"\"\"Verify that Airflow will be able to import all DAGS in the repo\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n\r\n        dagbag = self._get_dagbag()\r\n        assert len(dagbag.import_errors) == 0\r\n\r\n    def _get_dagbag(self):\r\n        dag_folder = os.getenv('AIRFLOW_DAGS', False)\r\n        assert dag_folder is not None\r\n\r\n        return DagBag(dag_folder=dag_folder, include_examples=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following error is raised:\r\n```\r\n# Used to store stats around DagBag processing \r\nstats = [] \r\nFileLoadStat = namedtuple( \r\n    'FileLoadStat', \r\n    \"file duration dag_num task_num dags\"\r\n)  \r\nfor filepath in utils.dag_processing.list_py_file_paths(dag_folder): \r\n\r\nE AttributeError: module 'airflow.utils' has no attribute 'dag_processing'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI am not sure how to introduce test for this specific issue, as it looks like the area is tested but works because dag_processing is imported at some point. Please advise on this. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-21T16:53:24Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T12:16:16Z","closed_at":"2018-07-22T12:16:16Z","merged_at":"2018-07-22T12:16:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba5b67b6c99e0bfb0f827518cdb31b5eb5a5a626","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ba5b67b6c99e0bfb0f827518cdb31b5eb5a5a626","head":{"label":"KevYuen:AIRFLOW-2778-bad-dagbag-import","ref":"AIRFLOW-2778-bad-dagbag-import","sha":"ba5b67b6c99e0bfb0f827518cdb31b5eb5a5a626","user":{"login":"KevYuen","id":4744103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4744103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen","html_url":"https://github.com/KevYuen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43784106,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc4NDEwNg==","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevYuen/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevYuen","id":4744103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4744103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen","html_url":"https://github.com/KevYuen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevYuen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevYuen/airflow","description":"AirFlow

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2773\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDataFlowPythonOperator generates a job name that does not get accepted by Dataflow API when task_id contains underscores. This PR replcaes `_` (underscore) with a `-` (dash) and also checks if the name is valid\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded assertion with regex\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-21T14:09:07Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:14:50Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T11:10:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed70f451eea6cfe57b8d97ab3195592df717d35c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/82d3e9beb00e305623afd13d08e5e6655d29ef2a","head":{"label":"kaxil:AIRFLOW-2773","ref":"AIRFLOW-2773","sha":"82d3e9beb00e305623afd13d08e5e6655d29ef2a","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2753\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2753\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - {{tests/contrib/operators/test_dataproc_operator.DataProcHadoopOperatorTest.test_dataproc_job_id_is_set}}\r\n    - {{tests/contrib/operators/test_dataproc_operator.DataProcHiveOperatorTest.test_dataproc_job_id_is_set}}\r\n    - {{tests/contrib/operators/test_dataproc_operator.DataProcPySparkOperatorTest.test_dataproc_job_id_is_set}}\r\n    - {{tests/contrib/operators/test_dataproc_operator.DataProcSparkOperatorTest.test_dataproc_job_id_is_set}}\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - Updated docstrings with appropriate `var` and `vartype` items.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n    - I assume that an cli status of `0` means that the above passes.","created_at":"2018-07-21T09:23:51Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T20:55:09Z","closed_at":"2018-07-22T20:55:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c8b8f0205e6b9da5c3dcef5eb22abfaf3fe4274","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3622/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3622/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3622/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/46b5a5ad5ccf3ada2f4a8d6c68b3f3479310f8cc","head":{"label":"bomboradata:master","ref":"master","sha":"46b5a5ad5ccf3ada2f4a8d6c68b3f3479310f8cc","user":{"login":"bomboradata","id":17934915,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE3OTM0OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17934915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata","html_url":"https://github.com/bomboradata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113917090,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM5MTcwOTA=","name":"bombora-incubator-airflow","full_name":"bomboradata/bombora-incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bomboradata","id":17934915,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE3OTM0OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17934915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata","html_url":"https://github.com/bomboradata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomboradata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bomboradata/bombora-incubator-airflow","description":"Apache
