operators perform SFTP operations by the means of `SFTPHook`. `SFTPHook` delegates the actual SFTP connection to\r\n the `pysftp` module.\r\n\r\nWhen connecting with a private key protected by a passphrase, the `private_key_pass` extra parameter must be\r\n specified in the connection, and this corresponds to the arguments' naming in `pysftp`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `SFTPHook` inherits from `SSHHook` which already manages a `private_key_passphrase` extra param. But this\r\n param is unused in favor of the `private_key_pass` param introduced in `SFTPHook`.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, I propose to drop `private_key_pass` in `SFTPHook` and to reuse `private_key_passphrase` from `SSHHook`.\r\nThis way, a single connection can be used for both SSH and SFTP operations.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-02T13:49:56Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T17:20:57Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T17:20:55Z","merged_at":"2021-06-10T17:20:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"9351e2a2d43b6ec3c019df19afb445a3dcf587ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

change adds a new GCS transform operator. It is based on the existing transform operator with the addition that it will transform multiple files that match the prefix and that were updated within a time-span. The time-span is implicitly defined: it is the time between the current execution timestamp of the DAG instance (time-span start) and the next execution timestamp of the DAG (time-span end). \r\n\r\nThe use-case is some entity generates files at irregular intervals and an undefined number. The operator will pick up all files that were updated since it executed last. Typically the transform script will iterate over the files, open them, extract some information, collate them into one or more files and upload them to GCS. These result files can then be loaded into BigQuery or processed further or served via a webserver.\r\n\r\nHere is an illustration that shows the concept:\r\n\r\n![bitmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192171/107156333-0411c000-697e-11eb-96c4-d19184bc4e15.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-31T12:21:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T14:57:27Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T14:57:25Z","merged_at":"2021-03-15T14:57:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddc9133d36f88dbecd260a4f28ac2dec39395edf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

is a resubmission of PR #13962. The original PR did not include corresponding unit test adjustments and therefore broke the build. This PR fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nOriginal PR #13962 description for reference:\r\n\r\nThe `open_maybe_zipped` function returns different file-like objects depending on whether it's called for a plain file or for a file in a zip archive. The problem is that by default `io.open` (used for plain files) returns file in text mode and subsequent `read` on it returns strings. `ZipFile` on the other hand by default returns a binary file and subsequent `read` on it returns bytes.\r\nThe returned value for `open_maybe_zipped` should be the same regardless whether it's a zip or a plain file--it should be in text mode. Returning binaries for zip packages causes problems. For example, when saving DAG code is turned on, the `DagCode` model tries to save DAG source code in the metadata database. SQLAlchemy throws an error for DAGs that come from a zip package, because tries to save binary value in a string column.","created_at":"2021-01-30T13:50:34Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T11:12:53Z","closed_at":"2021-02-01T13:42:10Z","merged_at":"2021-02-01T13:42:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"0bbc2cb1ef230dd12e15c074d15e72f5537dc41b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

PR addresses a test failure that was introduced in #13371 and identified by Kaxil/Jarek when syncing the `v1-10-x` branches.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the issue locally and found that Python 2.7 is able to read the file with bad bytes just fine without throwing a `UnicodeDecodeError`. Since this allows the rest of the rule to behave normally (i.e. the file is checked for the Airflow macro plugin contents), it won't raise any problems. I could set up this test to behave differently for 2.7 and 3.x respectively, but the easiest thing seemed to just skip this test on python 2.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

`open_maybe_zipped` function returns different file-like objects depending on whether it's called for a plain file or for a file in a zip archive. The problem is that by default `io.open` (used for plain files) returns file in text mode and subsequent `read` on it returns strings. `ZipFile` on the other hand by default returns a binary file and subsequent `read` on it returns bytes.\r\nThe returned value for `open_maybe_zipped` should be the same regardless whether it's a zip or a plain file--it should be in text mode. Returning binaries for zip packages causes problems. For example, when saving DAG code is turned on, the `DagCode` model tries to save DAG source code in the metadata database. SQLAlchemy throws an error for DAGs that come from a zip package, because tries to save binary value in a string column.\r\nThis PR fixes the problem.","created_at":"2021-01-28T22:40:47Z","updated_at":"2021-01-30T17:29:30Z","closed_at":"2021-01-29T07:48:15Z","merged_at":"2021-01-29T07:48:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc70227d9be25be5ce95c0dae4383c3883819d68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/13962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/13962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/13962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/aa32fedb4726cfff3132cc3c2558ece9c148edb7","head":{"label":"levahim:master","ref":"master","sha":"aa32fedb4726cfff3132cc3c2558ece9c148edb7","user":{"login":"levahim","id":1196882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTY4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1196882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim","html_url":"https://github.com/levahim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333972319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzM5NzIzMTk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"levahim/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"levahim","id":1196882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTY4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1196882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim","html_url":"https://github.com/levahim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levahim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/levahim/airflow","description":"Apache

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13504\r\n\r\nCurrently the DagFileProcessor parses the DAG files, writes it to the\r\n`dag` table and then writes DAGs to `serialized_dag` table.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the scheduler loop is constantly looking for the next\r\nDAGs to process based on ``next_dagrun_create_after`` column of the DAG\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIt might happen that as soon as the DagFileProcessor writes DAG to `dag`\r\ntable, the scheduling loop in the Scheduler picks up the DAG for preocessing.\r\nHowever, as the DagFileProcessor has not written to serialized DAG table yet\r\nthe scheduler will error with \"Serialized Dag not Found\" error.\r\n\r\nThis would mainly happen when the DAGs are dynamic where the result of one DAG,\r\ncreates multiple DAGs.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the order of writing DAG and Serialized DAG and hence\r\nbefore a DAG is written to `dag` table it will be written to `serialized_dag` table.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
