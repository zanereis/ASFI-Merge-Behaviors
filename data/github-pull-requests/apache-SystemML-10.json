PR adds the functionality of collecting, aggregating, and displaying statistics of the federated workers.\r\nThe following statistics are considered:\r\n* all the cache statistics\r\n* garbage collection statistics\r\n* heavy hitters\r\n* JIT times\r\n\r\nI introduced a new dml option _fedStats_ (similar to the existing _stats_ option) to enable the creation of federated statistics.\r\nTo better seperate the federated statistics from the local statistics, I created a new class _FederatedStatistics_.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds support for federated **binary, aggregate ternary, aggregate binary, ctable, and mmchain** instructions with multiple **aligned** federated matrices.\r\nI introduced a new enum _AType_ and the method _isAligned(AType)_ inside the FederationMap to simplify the alignment checks (to check for multiple possible partial alignments with a single call).\r\nTo avoid redundant code, I created a new static method _isFederated()_ in _SpoofFEDInstruction_, which is only a consolidation of the _isFederated()_ method of _SpoofCPInstruction_ and _SpoofSPInstruction_.\r\nIn addition, I changed several tests in order to include testcases with multiple federated inputs.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds a federated execution rewriter. \r\nThe rewriter currently loads the privacy constraints of federated data input from the federated workers and propagates these privacy constraints through the Hop DAG. The rewriter will be extended in a later PR with an execution plan builder, which will represent the different federated execution plans and evaluate the utility of each plan.\r\nThis PR additionally refactors the PrivacyPropagator to ensure that the Hop and instruction privacy propagation goes through the same core propagation.

[SYSTEMDS-2992+2993] Workload costing and Cost-based Compression Planning\r\n\r\nThis commit contains a new package in the compression framework, that\r\nallow selection of cost models for compression.\r\nOne classical cost model is memory size, in this commit there are\r\nmultiple more, most notably\r\n\r\nMEMORY, W_TREE, HYBRID, DISTINCT.\r\n\r\n- Memory is the memory based optimization,\r\n- W_TREE is based on the extracted WTree of instructions\r\n- HYBRID is a combination of memory and W_TREE,\r\n- DISTINCT is based on making the dictionaries as small as possible.\r\n- LEFT_MATRIX_MULT is based on optimizing only for Left Matrix Multiplications\r\n- Decompression is ... for decompression time\r\n- TSMM for fast transpose self matrix multiplication\r\n\r\nAdditionally to these additions all CoCoding thechniques now optimize\r\ntowards the given type of cost model, making it posible to make for\r\nfor instance BIN_PACKING DISTINCT optimization, or HYBRID Brute Force,\r\netc.","created_at":"2021-06-08T19:57:18Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T13:32:10Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T09:48:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdf80b728f36d0b686410868179f4354cc66a936","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/c7c5b34a8b336277f614708d26d5e44ce0ce4031","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:CLAWorkloadCosting","ref":"CLAWorkloadCosting","sha":"c7c5b34a8b336277f614708d26d5e44ce0ce4031","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

commit contains the following cleanups and additions,\r\n- removal of unnecessary scripts i.e., gridsearchMLR.dml and logicalFunc.dml because\r\n  the gridsearch builtin has been generalized to incorporate the cases for both lm and multiLogReg (16f4191)\r\n  and the enumerateLogical.dml covers the logical enumeration and logicalFunc.dml is not needed anymore.\r\n- minor formatting fixes in dml files in pipelines package.\r\n- Addition of string processing function in utils.dml to perform string operations on frame before recoding the data.\r\n- fixes in enumerateLogical.dml to make the algorithm more random.","created_at":"2021-05-30T13:31:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-30T17:31:05Z","closed_at":"2021-05-30T17:31:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f55f82b55b7549ea79c8373a6cdbde118680d8c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/4577ad3ce0f37e8e37f82815b8cc387b646af41f","head":{"label":"Shafaq-Siddiqi:4May","ref":"4May","sha":"4577ad3ce0f37e8e37f82815b8cc387b646af41f","user":{"login":"Shafaq-Siddiqi","id":53634062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53634062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi","html_url":"https://github.com/Shafaq-Siddiqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251010104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEwMTAxMDQ=","name":"systemml","full_name":"Shafaq-Siddiqi/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Shafaq-Siddiqi","id":53634062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53634062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi","html_url":"https://github.com/Shafaq-Siddiqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shafaq-Siddiqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Shafaq-Siddiqi/systemml","description":"Mirror

PR adds support for federated **spoof** instructions with multiple **aligned** federated matrices.\r\nIt was necessary to create an additional _isAligned()_ method in order to support partial alignments.\r\nThe _SpoofFEDInstruction_ needed some rewrites to not change the order of inputs, because we need the correct order to distinguish between the side inputs _U_ and _V_ for the outerproduct template.\r\nI added comparision of the end dimensions of federated ranges in _FederatedRange.compareTo()_, hope this does not create any problems with other functionalities.\r\nI also added the method _heavyHittersContains(Sub)String()_ with an additional parameter _minCallCount_ which allows to check for a minimum number of calls for a specific heavy hitter.\r\nThere are a lot of outcommented tests because I tried to bundle multiple testcases into a single test to reduce the time for test preparation.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

patch adds a lineage based debugger which keeps track of special values in matrixblocks in CP instructions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following design decisions are made and implemented:\r\n\r\n- `LINEAGE_DEBUGGER` flag as DMLScript option to enable the debugger (default: false)\r\n- Added `class BooleanArray32` for storing boolean information in an memory efficient way\r\n- This class is used as an attribute `_specialValueBits` in `LineageItem` to store the special value information\r\n- Check of special values is done in the `postprocessInstruction()`\r\n- Added serialization and deserialization of `_specialValueBits` with surrounding brackets\r\n- Added helper function to find the first occurrence of a special value given a `LineageItem`.\r\n\r\nAdditional info: \r\n\r\n- Only CP instructions are supported\r\n- Debugger keeps track of `Double.NaN`, `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` and `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`\r\n- Fixed missing default post-process call in `CPInstruction` and `GPUInstruction`\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T09:19:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-02T16:28:16Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T16:18:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2618637cf215bad3c0fbb7c7c73dc1b331b8795","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/034693b88e2855b6194796c70de748069c8e5a4c","head":{"label":"bnyra:SYSTEMDS-2889","ref":"SYSTEMDS-2889","sha":"034693b88e2855b6194796c70de748069c8e5a4c","user":{"login":"bnyra","id":15999240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTk5MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15999240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra","html_url":"https://github.com/bnyra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362496884,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjI0OTY4ODQ=","name":"systemds","full_name":"bnyra/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bnyra","id":15999240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTk5MjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15999240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra","html_url":"https://github.com/bnyra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnyra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bnyra/systemds","description":"Apache

is a PR for adding federated code generation for outer product templates, and the respective tests (hybrid execution mode to reduce the test time).\r\nI created some nested classes in _SpoofFEDInstruction.java_ for the different spoof template types to better distinguish between them (e.g., cellwise, rowwise, multiagg, outerproduct). Each class has its own _setOutput()_ method, whereas only the class of the outerproduct template has its own _needsBroadcastSliced()_ method, because the other classes can share it.\r\n\r\nThe federated spoof instruction for outerproduct templates is determining if an input matrix gets broadcast sliced based on its dimensions. This could create some problems, for example when computing\r\n`X * log(U %*% t(V))`\r\nwith federated matrix _X_ in dimensions _2000x2000_,  _U_ in _2000x10_, and _V_ in _2000x10_, it broadcasts both, _U_ and _V_, in a sliced manner because the row number matches with the dimension of the federated matrix. Obviously, depending on the federation type of _X_, either _U_ or _V_ should've been broadcast sliced. However, when _U_ and _V_ differ in the dimensions, everything is working how it should. How can we handle this case of similar dimensions?\r\n\r\nThanks for review

Security\r\n\r\nConfine to the apache.org or apache approved domains or user accounts on other platforms to keep our codebase robust and safe.\r\nThis relieves the projects contributors of their liability. If any doubt arises, open Jira or contact on dev list.\r\n\r\n**CI/testing:** In testing, where applicable the downloads are done we need to create mechanism to\r\ncheck for the security for trusted origin.\r\n\r\n**GitHub Actions:** Only [`Verified Creator`](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&verification=verified_creator) actions\r\ncan be used as is. For the user created actions the code needs to be first cloned to the github.com/apache account and used in\r\nthe actions with `ssh` clone.\r\n\r\n**Downloads:** [downloads.apache.org/systemds](https://downloads.apache.org/systemds) is the interface for project artifacts and the users.

See [docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/)\r\n\r\n**Submodules:** Submodules does have an inherent security risk. Before using the code as a submodule, try to contact the repository\r\nmaintainer for any security risks, license, attribution information, security keys etc. If possible, request them if they would like\r\nto help us in integration of their software (Some people are more than happy to do. Also, start a discussion on the dev mailing list\r\nwith `[DISCUSS]` tag.\r\n\r\n**Url shortener:** Apache Committers can use [s.apache.org](https://s.apache.org/), For gists use [paste.apache.org](https://paste.apache.org/)\r\nthere is a committer only option too.

\r\nI added some basic Frame functionality for the PythonAPI.\r\n\r\nFocused on:\r\n\r\n- Frame generation from pandas.DataFrame\r\n- write and read from csv incl. tests\r\n- rbind, cbind incl. tests\r\n- transform_encode and transform_apply incl. tests\r\n- hyperband test\r\n\r\nCurrently all those tests and the previous ones (~110 in total) are passing on my side\r\n\r\nSadly I forgot to turn off my auto-formatter, so right now it looks like there were quite some changes especially in \r\n\r\n`src/main/python/systemds/context/systemds_context.py`\r\n\r\nreal changes are pretty much only in read()\r\n\r\n`src/main/python/systemds/operator/operation_node.py`\r\n\r\nreal changes in:\r\n- rbind(), cbind()\r\n- some parser conditions added for OutputType.FRAME\r\n- some checks/assertions\r\n\r\n\r\nif the formatting changes are an issue for those two files, let me know, then I'll try to find a proper way of fixing those.\r\njust wanted to add an initial pull-request so it can already be inspected.\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nBernhard Leder

PR adds federated output flag propagation to AggregateBinaryFEDInstruction. This requires partial aggregation of federated data, which means that several new processing cases have been added to the instruction. Additionally, a new field called `_overlapNum` has been added to the FederatedRange class, which ensures that ranges of identical dimensions can be added to the federation map, and a new federation type called `FType.PART` has been added to represent partially aggregated federated data. The `readBlobFromFederated` method in MatrixObject.java has been adapted to handle partially aggregated data by aggregating the data when the method is called. \r\n**The reviewer of this PR should especially evaluate the changes made to FederationMap and FederatedRange to support the partially aggregated data and whether this partially aggregated data is properly processed.**
