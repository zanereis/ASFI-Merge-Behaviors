Additionally, the option to disassociate IPs is available for IPs in use by system VMs, both through group actions and `dataView`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these UI bugs. Furthermore, a label, similar to the existing ones for `source-nat` and `static-nat`, was created to indicate that a public IP is in use by a system VM. Lastly, the `allocated` column in the `ListView`, that represents the datetime an IP was allocated, is now parsed and formatted according to the user's timezone.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently is possible to change the host's password by using the `updateHostPassword` API; however, this option is not available in the UI.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the option to change the host's password via UI.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2025-02-05 18-10-50](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6395d17e-72fe-41af-ab77-a8192b04ee41)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local environment, I checked that the new option was available and tried to change the password using the new form. Looking the database I verified that the password changed.\r\n\r\nI also forced some exceptions, like by using a wrong username as a parameter. Everything worked as expected.","created_at":"2025-02-06T14:15:32Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T15:42:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc948f3b23e6f4c23786adedf004deece20a60dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35/labels","id":11418179,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4ArjpD","number":35,"title":"4.21.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":150,"closed_issues":26,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-08-08T08:47:33Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T11:58:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/10337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/8d5c236f7f3720243a337c370cdbdaf63e7b9c70","head":{"label":"scclouds:change-password-UI","ref":"change-password-UI","sha":"8d5c236f7f3720243a337c370cdbdaf63e7b9c70","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

As expected, the `VOLUME` usage type was the only one that didn't result in an error.\r\n\r\nFinally, for each preset variable, I created a tariff using them, and the tariff was applied in every case, as expected.","created_at":"2025-02-04T21:23:47Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T18:02:48Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"576d00a896f4e5837fe1ad5398a6609cf453fcc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2447384660,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQ3Mzg0NjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:quota","name":"component:quota","color":"3ec98d","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/10326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/928c043f5bcac6a504ec70ddc533eb230787fdcb","head":{"label":"scclouds:add-iops-and-bytes-presets-to-volume-usage-type","ref":"add-iops-and-bytes-presets-to-volume-usage-type","sha":"928c043f5bcac6a504ec70ddc533eb230787fdcb","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a command to mark a Management Server as removed on the database only if its status is marked as `Down`. To execute the command, it is obligatory to inform the `id` of the targeted MS.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, I added an MS through the database.\r\n\r\n- With State=\"Down\" I executed through CMK `remove managementserver id=<uuid>` and verified that the MS wasn't being listed on the UI and was marked as `Removed` on the database.\r\n- With State=\"Up\" I executed the same command and verified an error was returned informing it wasn't possible to remove an MS which state was marked as \"Up\".\r\n- With State=\"Down\" I executed through a URL `http://<IP>:8080/client/api?command=removeManagementServer&response=json&id=<UUID>` and verified the MS was marked as removed and wasn't being listed on the UI.\r\n- With State=\"Up\" I executed the same URL and received an error informing it wasn't possible to remove an MS which state was marked as \"Up\".\r\n- Trying to execute the command with a non-existent _id_ returns an error warning the request format may be invalid, the entity may not exist, or the parameter annotation may be wrong.\r\n- Trying to execute the command without an _id_, both in CMK and with a URL, returns an error informing the _id_ parameter is obligatory and it is missing.","created_at":"2025-02-04T15:39:54Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T14:28:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073134,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:management-server","name":"component:management-server","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":956526498,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTY1MjY0OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:has-conflicts","name":"status:has-conflicts","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35/labels","id":11418179,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4ArjpD","number":35,"title":"4.21.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":150,"closed_issues":26,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-08-08T08:47:33Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T11:58:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10325/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10325/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/10325/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/329a11183a8b1ac10c84f401480091d2140ed331","head":{"label":"scclouds:add-remove-ms-api-command","ref":"add-remove-ms-api-command","sha":"329a11183a8b1ac10c84f401480091d2140ed331","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organiz

Description\r\n\r\nPre-seeded template storages always had there pre initialized 0 sizes and would never be updated.\r\nThis makes later problems, when the primary storage should pre-allocate the volume as it doesn't know the size\r\nand would fail or maybe try to delay the allocation until the agent code knows the size.\r\nThis updates the sizes from the template.properties files on the validateIfSeeded check.\r\n\r\nThe issue was found while reviewing #10132 \r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION

Description\r\n\r\nFix issues with SAML multi-account selector in UI and various SAML2 plugin limitations.\r\n\r\n* Reliable account switch when selecting a new account/domain combination from UI\r\n* New global property (saml2.require.password) to disable password authentication requirement (this enables delegation to the SAML IDP to allow other forms of authentication like 2FA, mobile device, security key, etc).  Default to true to match previous hard-coded behavior.\r\n* New global property (user.allow.multiple.accounts) to allow the same username to exist on multiple accounts in the same domain.  Defaults to false to match previous behavior.  Also this ONLY applies to SAML2 plugin at this time as other account types do not have an implementation for multi-account selection.\r\n* Update to use value of saml2.user.sessionkey.path (when set) on all session identity cookies during SAML2 session setup to simplify use across a reverse proxy.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nSetup domain using SAML2 IDP (Azure Entra specifically) and performed validations of existing behaviors (single username only in a domain; password auth requirement), as well as tested ability to add multiple accounts for the same username in a domain and authentication with 2FA/device authentication.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-31T19:34:24Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T16:28:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a96fb9bcdaf94911ccf659e43c20039795c9b8c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073134,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:management-server","name":"component:management-server","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073351,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vpc","name":"component:vpc","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":893788912,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTM3ODg5MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:saml","name":"component:saml","color":"edef73","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1970680557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTcwNjgwNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:orchestration","name":"component:orchestration","color":"fcabf0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/38","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/38","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/38/labels","id":12224971,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AuonL","number":38,"title":"4.19.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":1,"state":"open","created_at":"2025-01-27T15:00:01Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T18:50:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/10311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/1f50e61e773f9bf1e09a2c7f1c7ddfadd24552cd","head":{"label":"rg9975:4.19-fix-saml-account-selector","ref":"4.19-fix-saml-account-selector","sha":"1f50e61e773f9bf1e09a2c7f1c7ddfadd24552cd","user":{"login":"rg9975","id":4451650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4451650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975","html_url":"https://github.com/rg9975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rg9975/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":681203419,"node_id":"R_kgDOKJpW2w","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"rg9975/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rg9975","id":4451650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserconte

Description\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #10163, where the secondary storage VM fails to add a static route to the NFS server, causing a `No route to host` error. The `_storageIp` was previously null, resulting in failed route addition (`via null`).\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- Improved `_storageIp` handling to prevent null values.\r\n- Added utility methods to validate NFS server reachability.\r\n- Enhanced error handling and logging.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Verified successful template uploads to secondary storage.\r\n- Checked route addition on the SSVM.\r\n- Ran unit tests (`S3TemplateTest`, etc.), all tests passed successfully.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-30T17:53:41Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T05:19:02Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22aaab3d961cadb156a6f29ea2af7120e4bb17f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1152978013,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTUyOTc4MDEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:build","name":"component:build","color":"6e1ec9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/10304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/51dec8c1ea034c5c3449fbab8eb49a476454d332","head":{"label":"iishitahere:fix-nfs-route-bug","ref":"fix-nfs-route-bug","sha":"51dec8c1ea034c5c3449fbab8eb49a476454d332","user":{"login":"iishitahere","id":184753973,"node_id":"U_kgDOCwMfNQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184753973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere","html_url":"https://github.com/iishitahere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":897323515,"node_id":"R_kgDONXwR-w","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"iishitahere/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iishitahere","id":184753973,"node_id":"U_kgDOCwMfNQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184753973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere","html_url":"https://github.com/iishitahere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iishitahere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iishitahere/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the concept of multi-scope configuration settings. In addition to the Global level, currently all configurations can be set at a single scope level.\r\nIt will be useful if a configuration can be set at multiple scopes. For example, a configuration set at the domain level\r\nwill apply for all accounts, but it can be set for an account as well. In which case the account level setting will override the domain level setting.\r\n\r\nThis is done by changing the column `scope` of table `configuration` from string (single scope) to bitmask (multiple scopes).\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum Scope {\r\n    Global(null, 1),\r\n    Zone(Global, 1 << 1),\r\n    Cluster(Zone, 1 << 2),\r\n    StoragePool(Cluster, 1 << 3),\r\n    ManagementServer(Global, 1 << 4),\r\n    ImageStore(Zone, 1 << 5),\r\n    Domain(Global, 1 << 6),\r\n    Account(Domain, 1 << 7);\r\n```\r\nEach scope is also assigned a parent scope. When a configuration for a given scope is not defined but is available for multiple scope types, the value will be retrieved from the parent scope. If there is no parent scope or if the configuration is defined for a single scope only, the value will fall back to the global level.\r\n\r\nHierarchy for different scopes is defined as below :\r\n- Global\r\n    - Zone\r\n        - Cluster\r\n            - Storage Pool\r\n        - Image Store\r\n    - Management Server\r\n    - Domain\r\n        - Account\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the scope of the following configurations (Storage Pool scope is added in addition to the existing Zone scope):\r\n- pool.storage.allocated.capacity.disablethreshold\r\n- pool.storage.allocated.resize.capacity.disablethreshold\r\n- pool.storage.capacity.disablethreshold\r\n\r\n\r\nDoc PR : https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/476\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nIf the URL params contains `username` or `domain`, it will use the values for the username and domain field in Login, forgot password and reset password page. This feature would be useful if you want to open a page which has prefilled usename and/or domain. To test the forgot password and reset password page, you need to enable the `user.password.reset.enabled` global setting.\r\n\r\ne.g. The below url will look like this when opened.\r\n\r\nhttps://qa.cloudstack.cloud/simulator/pr/10291/#/user/login?username=admin&domain=ABC\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb1ac0a8-5867-4ee8-b4b8-165da69a0fb2)\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Generated description</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes changes to the forms in the authentication views to support additional query parameters.

By using this option, the KVM hypervisor will choose the cache mode to be used by the disk.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Disk offering creation</summary>\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2025-01-27 12-13-00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8a1940a-3542-46dd-8cb1-fe0185304d10)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Compute offering with compute only disk offering creation</summary>\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2025-01-27 12-14-10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aab2680-c62e-4f75-949e-c510c1c3a4bf)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I created a disk offering and a compute offering with compute only disk offering using the `Hypervisor default` as cache mode;\r\n2. I deployed a VM for each offering from step 1;\r\n3. I verified through `virt-manager` that the disk of both VMs was using the `Hypervisor default` cache mode, as in the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2025-01-27

Description\r\n\r\nIt should have been always possible to use multiple primary storages, with the same linstor-controller, by just using different resource-groups with different settings.\r\nBut if the same template was used on 2 different primary storages, there would be a name collision on the linstor-controller, as 2 of them would get allocated to the same name.\r\nThis commit fixes this, by intelligently reusing the same template, as long as possible (if select filter properties match enough).\r\n\r\n<!--- *******************************************************************************

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when changing the `Decimal`, `Number` and `Range` global settings values through the UI, CloudStack does not validate if the inserted values are numeric. Additionally, when letters are entered in the inputs, a message indicating that the setting value was successfully updated is returned to the operators, which does not effectively happen.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to verify the values that are entered in those input fields. If non-numeric values are inserted, they will be ignored. Furthermore, it is still possible to use special keys, such as `Ctrl` and `Alt`, in order to make use of keyboard shortcuts.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- Verified that in `Decimal` and `Range` global settings it is only possible to enter digits and the period (`.`) character.\r\n- Verified that in `Number` global settings it is only possible to enter digits.\r\n- Verified that in `Decimal`, `Number` and `Range` global settings it is still possible to make use of keyboard shortcuts with special

Description\r\n\r\nAccounts created with the `Read-Only User - Default` and `Support User - Default` roles do not have access to `setupUserTwoFactorAuthentication`, `validateUserTwoFactorAuthenticationCode` and `listUserTwoFactorAuthenticatorProviders` APIs. Additionally, accounts created with the `Read-Only Admin - Default` and `Support Admin - Default` roles only have access to the `listUserTwoFactorAuthenticatorProviders` API.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, when 2FA is required for authentication, accounts with these roles cannot login into CloudStack. Thus, this PR proposes to grant access to the 2FA-related APIs for the previously mentioned roles.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #10269\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or

Description\r\n\r\nIn CloudStack, the security group selection box is displayed when editing a VM, regardless of whether the zone supports security groups or not. This causes the `securitygroupids` parameter to be sent with the request even if no security group is selected. If the zone is of type `NetworkType.Advanced` and does not support security groups, this triggers a `NullPointerException` in the `UserVmManagerImpl.updateVirtualMachine` method when calling `isSecurityGroupSupportedInNetwork`.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it was found that the `listZones` API call, which is used to fetch the zone details, incorrectly uses `zoneid` instead of `id` for the zone identifier. This prevents the correct zone information from being retrieved. Additionally, since the `listZones` API does not properly filter zones, it fetches all zones and always takes the first one in the list (index 0) to determine whether security groups are enabled. Consequently, if that first zone supports security groups, the security group selection box is displayed in the UI—even if the zone actually used by the VM does not support them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the logic for checking whether the security group selection box is empty is not strict enough, which causes the `securitygroupids` parameter to be included in the request even when the selection box is empty.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n1. Correct the parameter name for the zone identifier when calling the `listZones` API by using `id` instead of `zoneid`.\r\n2. Filter the zones correctly in the `listZones` API call to ensure that only the relevant zone is considered when checking for security group support.\r\n3. Improve the logic for checking if the security group selection box is empty before attaching the `securitygroupids` parameter to the request.\r\n\r\n#### Modified Files\r\n\r\n- `EditVM.vue`\r\n\r\n#### PR Changes\r\n- Fix incorrect usage of `zoneid` in `listZones` calls to properly retrieve the VM’s zone details.\r\n- Only consider the matching zone (instead of just taking the first item) to determine whether security groups are enabled.\r\n- Enhance the empty-check logic for the security group selection, preventing `securitygroupids` from being included if no security group is actually selected.\r\n- Prevent a `NullPointerException` when editing VMs in `NetworkType.Advanced` zones that do not support security groups.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. **Local Dev Environment**  \r\n   - Configured multiple zones: one supporting security groups and one not supporting security groups (VPC).  \r\n   - Edited a VM in each zone to confirm that:\r\n     1. When the zone supports SG, the security group selection is displayed and functions correctly.\r\n     2. When the zone does not support SG, no security group selection is displayed or an empty list is properly handled, and no `securitygroupids` is sent to the backend.\r\n   - Verified no `NullPointerException` is thrown even if `securitygroupids` is `null` or empty.\r\n\r\n2. **UI Validation**  \r\n   - Checked that the modified logic in `EditVM.vue` properly filters the correct zone from `listZones`.\r\n   - Ensured that if the user does not select a security group, the request does not include `securitygroupids`.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n- Attempted to edit a VM in a zone that does not support SG and artificially forced the frontend to pass `securitygroupids`, verifying that no NPE occurs.\r\n- Made sure any new changes do not affect zones where security groups are legitimately supported.","created_at":"2025-01-21T08:31:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T09:05:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e47c4445cda14940a1c1ef3d9a4fde795928592","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Pearl1594","id":10495417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk1NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10495417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594","html_url":"https://github.com/Pearl1594","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pearl1594/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/10224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/10224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/9d4128bc982e87747110bc7a876c68d0f3b20f90","head":{"label":"toolmanwyj:fix/security-group-selection-bug","ref":"fix/security-group-selection-bug","sha":"9d4128bc982e87747110bc7a876c68d0f3b20f90","user":{"login":"toolmanwyj","id":68314030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzE0MDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68314030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj","html_url":"https://github.com/toolmanwyj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":919898756,"node_id":"R_kgDONtSKhA","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"toolmanwyj/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"toolmanwyj","id":68314030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzE0MDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68314030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj","html_url":"https://github.com/toolmanwyj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toolmanwyj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/toolmanwyj/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the cpu shares value is never < 2 to be compatible with Libvirt versions before 9.1.0.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\nIt turned out that the older libvirt versions, such as Ubuntu 22.04 libvirt 8.0.0 has the hardcoded range of allowed cpu shares values for both cgroupv1 and cgroupv2, which is 2-262144. \r\nThis range enforcement was removed in Libvirt 9.1.0, see: https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/commit/38af6497610075e5fe386734b87186731d4c17ac\r\n\r\nIf a host has lots of cores, and the huge CPU overprovisioning factor is set, then the computed shares value can become 1.\r\nIn such case, the following exception is generated on the Cloudstack Agent during provisioning:\r\n`org.libvirt.LibvirtException: unsupported configuration: Value of cputune 'shares' must be in range [2, 262144]`\r\n\r\nWe noticed it when tried to restart a Shared network with cleanup.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Get a KVM hypervisor host with lots of cores that has affected Libvirt version. Ubuntu 22.04 works.\r\n2. Make sure that cgroup v2 is enabled on the hypervisor: `mount | grep -q cgroup2 && echo \"yes, enabled\"` should echo the output.\r\n3. Set the overprovisioning ratio to some ridiculously high value, e.g. 1000\r\n4. Try to restart any network with cleanup. Since the virtual routers have tiny CPU specs (1 core, 500Mhz by default), it should trigger the bug. \r\n5. The `com.cloud.exception.InsufficientServerCapacityException: No destination found for a deployment for VM instance` will be generated on the management server.\r\n6. On the agent, you will see the following message in the log: `org.libvirt.LibvirtException: unsupported configuration: Value of cputune 'shares' must be in range [2, 262144]`\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested on Ubuntu 22.04 with Libvirt 8.0.0.\r\nAfter the patch was applied, the error was gone, and the virtual router appeared after the restart with the cpushares value 2.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\nThe only effective change that this change does, is excluding the return value \"1\".

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when listing VMs by network (`networkid`) or VPC (`vpcid`), CloudStack does not check whether the VMs still belong to the specified network or VPC. Therefore, this PR fixes this issue by only filtering the VMs that have non-removed NICs in the specified network or VPC. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nFirst, I created an isolated network (`nw-01`) and a VPC (`vpc-01`) with two tiers (`tier-01` and `tier-02`).

Description\r\n\r\nOn the allocation process of VM volumes, the reordering of storage pools by capacity is wrongly identifying whether a pool is shared or not. A pool is considered to be shared when its type (represented by the `Storage.StoragePoolType` enum) is shared; however, as can be observed from the enum options, the `VMFS` storage type is considered to be shared.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/35fe19f096dd38987bd1f892c78e9cce42c05c49/api/src/main/java/com/cloud/storage/Storage.java#L138-L159\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of that, when trying to deploy VMs in `VMFS` local storages, the allocation of the volumes will fail. Based on the current reordering flow, CloudStack will check that the `VMFS` pool type is shared and set the capacity type to be equal to `Capacity.CAPACITY_TYPE_STORAGE_ALLOCATED`. Then, when the DAO method is executed, the `VMFS` pools will not be present in the returned list of pools, as they require the capacity type `Capacity.CAPACITY_TYPE_LOCAL_STORAGE` to be retrieved.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/35fe19f096dd38987bd1f892c78e9cce42c05c49/engine/storage/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/storage/allocator/AbstractStoragePoolAllocator.java#L135-L141\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to fix this issue by changing the validation of whether a given storage pool is shared. For this check, the `com.cloud.storage.StoragePool#isShared` method is now invoked, which considers a storage pool to be local if it has a scope equal to `HOST`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTo validate the allocation process of VM volumes before the PR changes, I first changed the `vm.allocation.algorithm` value to `firstfitleastconsumed`. Then, when deploying a VM with a local storage compute offering, I checked through the logs that no `VMFS` pool was being retrieved. When reproducing the same steps after applying the PR changes, I verified that the `VMFS` pools were correctly retrieved.","created_at":"2025-01-16T14:04:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T10:45:01Z","closed_at":"2025-01-30T17:44:48Z","merged_at":"2025-01-30T17:44:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"a335feab6a366e196b9f92c0a86fbbcefaa8eae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33/labels","id":11200547,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4Aqugj","number":33,"title":"4.19.2","description":"minor

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `account.created` preset variable to Quota tariffs, allowing users to consider an account's creation date when defining values to, for instance, grant a discount on the first month.\r\n\r\nThis variable is injected as a String. Therefore, users need to parse it first: `Date.parse(account.created)`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, the billing of two accounts was compared in relation to the amount of VM snapshots each one has.\r\n\r\n- User Account: created on 17 Oct 2024 17:36:46, with 3 VM snapshots\r\n- Root Account: created on 24 Oct 2024 13:51:35, with 1 VM snapshot\r\n\r\nThe base script for the activation rule used was:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntoday = new Date(); // current date was 24 Oct 2024\r\ndaysDiff = (today-Date.parse(account.created))/(1000*60*60*24);\r\n\r\nif (daysDiff <= 5 && daysDiff >= 0) {\r\n  20\r\n} else {\r\n  0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `daysDiff` is less than or equal to 15 both accounts were charged. When `daysDiff` is less than or equal to 5 only the Root Account was charged.\r\n\r\nIt was noted that the first Root Account created by ACS doesn't have a creation date so the script was changed to:

Description\r\n\r\nThe slider component for global settings of `Range` type is currently not working correctly. Its width is equal to `0px`, and operators can only set the settings values to 0 or 100%. This PR addresses this issue by fixing the slider's behavior, allowing operators to properly adjust the settings values using the component.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [X] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n- Before:\r\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f946b0ec-bccd-4a14-9cfa-0c40b2c9a446)\r\n\r\n-

modified using the slider

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, if an account with network permissions for guest networks is deleted, CloudStack does not automatically delete these permissions, and operators cannot delete them later through the APIs. The workaround for this scenario is to manually remove the permissions entries from the `cloud.network_permissions` table. Therefore, this PR proposes to clean up the network permissions of an account when it is deleted. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when attempting to delete an account that is a project administrator, an error message is returned. This error message has been enhanced to include instructions on the next steps the operator should perform to properly delete the given account.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #10103\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nFirst, I created a domain `ROOT/d1`, a domain admin (`d1`) and two regular users within it (`u1` and `u2`). With the `d1` account, I created a project and added the `u1` account as a project administrator. \r\n\r\nWhen attempting to delete the `u1` account, an error message was returned, indicating that the account was a project administrator.  \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125c5a37-c549-4c8d-b29d-aff37a371d8c)\r\n\r\nAfter demoting the account to a regular project role, I created two guest networks and granted permission to both `u1` and `u2` accounts.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nMariaDB [cloud]> select * from network_permissions;\r\n+----+------------+------------+\r\n| id | network_id | account_id |\r\n+----+------------+------------+\r\n|  8 |        209 |         14 |\r\n|  9 |        209 |         16 |\r\n| 10 |        210 |         16 |\r\n| 11 |        210 |         14 |\r\n+----+------------+------------+\r\n4 rows in set (0.001 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I deleted the `u1` account, which has a serial ID equal to `16`, and verified that the network permissions were correctly expunged:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nMariaDB [cloud]> select * from network_permissions;\r\n+----+------------+------------+\r\n| id | network_id | account_id |\r\n+----+------------+------------+\r\n|  8 |        209 |         14 |\r\n| 11 |        210 |         14 |\r\n+----+------------+------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.001 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI reproduced these same steps with the `u2` account and verified that the network permissions were also correctly

Description\r\n\r\nFor HA work items that are created for host state change, checks must be done when execution is called in a new management server session.\r\n\r\nA new column, reason, has been added in cloud.op_ha_work table to track the reason for HA work.\r\n\r\nWhen HighAvailabilityManager starts it finds and puts all pending HA work items in Investigating state. During execution of the HA work if it is found in investigating state, checks are done to verify if the work is still valid. If the jobs is found to be invalid it is cancelled.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solved an issue when cs-agent throws an exception during ssl handshake; the TCP connection is not closed between cs-server and cs-agent, which further causes the server thread to hang forever. \r\n\r\nWhen the ssl handshake is at the **client key exchange** phrase, the server will be waiting for the agent to provide cipher suit, but at the agent side the exception could happen when the agent can’t conform to the cipher suite that the server provides, so the agent couldn’t communicate client key to the server. Thus at the server side the handshake thread is **forever pending** on a function that expects to read packets from SocketChannel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce this issue\r\n1.server uses a 1024 bit rsa public key which you can verify by typing “keytool -list -storepass $keystore_password -keystore $keystore_file -v”. \r\n2.find “Subject Public Key Algorithm” in the step 1 output.\r\n2.at the agent, edit “JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security” and append “RSA keySize < 2048” to **jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms**.\r\n3.restart cloudstack-agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nBefore I applied this change, in that situation and at the agent side, the state of the tcp connection was CLOSE_WAIT and remained there forever.
