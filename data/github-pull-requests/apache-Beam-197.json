the Go SDK's necessary default use of reflection to achieve more idiomatic user code, it's up to the framework to reduce this overhead as much as possible. This benchmark illustrates the various methods available to the Go SDK and informs work I've been doing on [BEAM-3612].\r\n\r\nHaving properly generated type assertion shims at present represents a reduction of around ~400ns per function invocation. As mentioned in the JIRA, I've got a tool I've been working on to make generating these shims easier.\r\n\r\nFurther, this reveals there's a way to change how we handle *method* invocation which is relevant for Structural DoFns. The way we use a reflect.Value.Interface() call to get to back to an indirect interface{} version of the method, we typically go through the \"Implicit Receiver\" route, so that the receiver we're operating on (the Structural DoFn with the associated state) is implicitly cached and instated by the reflection code when we call it. This adds ~180ns overhead (on my machine) compared to the the Explicit Receiver version.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part here is that moving to Explicit Receivers requires a minor overhaul through the beam function handling code, to properly mark the receiver parameter for the type checking phase. This is better accomplished after we have *tools* to re-generate type assertion shims for the SDK, if we're doing it at all.\r\n\r\nFinally, by having arity Explicit invocation of the shims reduces overhead by another 30ns. This is probably something that can be generated one off (with the above concession to the Explicit Receiver approach) to get a base set of combinatorial values. However, the extra overhead of a arity specialized invoker might be more than the 30ns cost of allocating & extracting the values from the slice, so this should be more specifically benchmarked in context of invoking for ParDos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

have unfortunately not had enough time to figure out the best way to refactor these tests. It appears that the entire test class may have similar issues, but only this method is known to have failed.\r\n\r\nIf skipping this method or the class enables parallel tests, I think that is worthwhile. The tests themselves do add value for Dataflow in portability, so it should be temporary or they can be run another way.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

adds more detail to how to roll forward after a roll back, breaking it down into common cases.\r\n\r\nThe phrasing on the website implies that a postcommit failure is necessarily a bug in the code that caused the failure. This is only one of three common scenarios. We don't want people to think the policy does not apply to their change just because the failure was not a bug in their change.\r\n\r\nhttp://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/6873/contribute/postcommits-policies/index.html\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

The reason it passed was because 0 counters were created\r\n(false-positive).

It may be that the shading set up for the new test utils is broken all around, but this anyhow restores the Nexmark signal.\r\n\r\nI have verified offline that running the benchmarks at head fails for all runners, and succeeds for the direct runner with this change.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

pull request defines two properties that any `Coder` implementation should satisfy. There are two coders that don't properly implement `structuralValue`: `MapCoder` and `RowCoder`.\r\n\r\n`RowCoder#consistentWithEquals` is defined as always true. It isn't true in case schema has field of type `Map<BYTES, ?>`. However, such field type makes little sense. One of the ways to fix it would be to reject such schemas. For now, this test is ignored.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

changes 2 things:\r\n\r\n  1. Makes the rename() in HDFS overwrite existing files which is necessary as it is the only FS which throws on this scenario currently.\r\n  2. Changes the WriteOperation.moveToOutput() to do a `rename` instead of a \"copy and delete\". GCS and S3 implement a rename() as a copy and delete so this does not change behaviour when using those FS. It will change behaviour when using a LocalFileSystem to an atomic move instead of a copy/delete.\r\n\r\nThis PR brings necessary performance improvements for HDFS users (e.g. 102 minutes down to 42 minutes for rewriting 1.5TB avro.

default, beam will create a single python sdk worker per Flink taskmanager / job, and #6524 added an option (`--sdk-worker-parallelism stage`) that would instead create one python worker per Flink stage. However in our experience this leads to far too many python processes (possibly thousands), as flink may run many stages in a single task slot.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an alternate approach to managing sdk worker concurrency. Basically, we know that our box has some capacity (roughly correlated to number of CPU cores) and we'd like to use as much as possible for executing our worker code, while not suffering the overhead of too many worker processes.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `--sdk-worker-parallelism` now takes the number of processes to run per TM. By default this is 1 (retaining the existing behavior). There's also an \"auto\" value of 0 that will set it to `number of cores - 1`, which is likely what most streaming users would want. As stages are constructed, we will create new StageContexts until we have `--sdk-worker-parallelism` of them, then we round-robin assign new stages to the existing contexts.\r\n\r\ncc @tweise \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Python PostCommit build scripts to make testing easier to config and run:\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `script/run_postcommit.sh`, which has many hacks to cover corner cases and is hard to understand/use/maintain. Use [`script/run_integration_test.sh`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/scripts/run_integration_test.sh) instead. The new script does exactly same thing but has better documentations and more command line flags support, which can be used by Jenkins or manually on local machine.\r\n- Refactor Python Gradle tasks that run integration tests in PostCommit jobs. The purpose is to keep test specific configs in `build.gradle`. We should be able to run any set of integration tests (ITs, ValidatesRunner tests on any runner) by building necessary test/pipeline options in Gradle tasks and then run with `script/run_integration_test.sh`.\r\n- Add comment blocks in `build.gradle`.\r\n\r\nAlso increase timeout of each python execution to 4500s (using nose flag `--process-timeout`). \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status
