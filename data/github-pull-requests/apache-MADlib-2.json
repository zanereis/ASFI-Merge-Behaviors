is a major refactor of the model hopper parallelism of the deep learning module.\r\n\r\n# A new data flow for the model hopper\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nIn v1.17, MADlib creates 3 temporary tables to store the model weights while they are being\r\nhopped around and trained:  mst_weights_tbl, weights_to_update_tbl, and model_output_table.\r\nThis gives rise to 3 different long-running queries that each involve at least one Redistribute Motion:\r\nthe UDA query (which does the actual training), the UPDATE query, and the HOP query.  Most of the time in\r\nmadlib_keras_fit_multiple() is spent in a loop over iterations and hops calling the run_training()\r\nfunction which performs each of these 3 stages, where all of the models circulate between\r\nthese 3 temporary tables and get back to where they started after each full iteration.\r\nThe overall effect was a lot of unnecessary motion of the model weights going back and forth \r\nbetween different segment hosts several times for each call to run_training().  Each hop was\r\nreally 3 or 4 hops in terms of data motion, which for a modest sized data set can cause\r\nthe hopping phase of the cycle to take just as long as the training phase, leaving GPU's with a lot\r\nof idle time.\r\n\r\n## 3 Biggest Changes\r\n\r\n1.  This refactor involves a major simplification where the 3 temporary tables are replaced by 2 temporary tables (model_input_tbl and model_output_tbl) and the UPDATE stage is eliminated to leave only the HOP and\r\nUDA stages.  There were also 3 shorter-running TRUNCATE & DROP queries in between the 3 longer queries.\r\nThese are also reduced to only 2 TRUNCATE & DROP queries.\r\n\r\n### Two additional performance improvements closely related to the above are:\r\n\r\n2.  A __dist_key__ column is added to model_output table and both of the temporary tables are\r\n       DISTRIBUTED BY this key instead of mst.  The __dist_key__'s have a 1-to-1 mapping with segment_id's,\r\n       as in the batched source table.  This serves as the hash key for all JOIN's now.\r\n       The schedule table has both a __dist_key__ column and a __previous_dist_key__ column,\r\n       so that it can guide the weights from the specific segment they were on previously\r\n       to the one they are scheduled to be on for the next hop.  This avoids any additional\r\n       Redistribute Motions caused by table Hash Join's.  With this change, there is no longer any\r\n       movement of the models at all except during the hop itself.  They only move\r\n       exactly once per call to run_training().\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n3.  For model weight averaging (madlib_keras_fit()), we needed a merge and a final function\r\n     in addition to the fit_transition function, so a UDA was the natural choice.  For the model\r\n     hopper (madlib_keras_fit_multiple()), there is no need for merge or final, all we need is\r\n     to call the fit_transition function directly on each row--so it was less clear whether a UDA\r\n     was the right choice.  We found that calling it as a UDF directly, and using SD to pass\r\n     the state from one row to the next (as we were doing already anyway with the UDA), resulted\r\n     in slightly better performance.  So now fit_transition can be called either as a UDF or as part\r\n     of a UDA, and fit_transition_multiple_model() is always called as a UDF.\r\n\r\n## Other Performance Enhancements\r\n\r\n4.  There is no need to hop the models between the last hop of the previous iteration and the first hop of the next iteration, so once per iteration we skip the hop and instead just rename model_output_tbl to model_input_tbl before truncating and dropping model_output_tbl.  For example, if there were 4 segments then in v1.17 that means 4 model hops per iteration.  In this branch, the last hop is skipped and the next iteration just starts with the models on the same segments they are already on.  The 4 hops has been reduced to only 3 hops.  The same amount of training occurs as before, and each model is paired exactly once per iteration with each segment--just in a slightly different order.\r\n\r\n5.  Much faster initialization code:  previously, we were reading the weights\r\n      in from the original model output table (during warm start) and the model\r\n      arch table (for transfer learning) one mst row at a time from segment to\r\n      master, then writing them each back out one row at a time from master\r\n      back to segments with a large number of SELECT and INSERT queries.\r\n      Now, we just use a single query to copy the weights directly from the\r\n      original model output table into the new model output table on the\r\n      segments, without ever sending them to master.  And a similar single\r\n      query copies the transfer learning weights directly from model_arch to\r\n      model_output for training.  Both of these happen in parallel on the\r\n      segments, instead of in sequence on master.  During testing of warm\r\n      start on a 20-segment cluster with 20 models, this resulted in a 10x reduction\r\n      in initialization time (26s instead of 5 mins in v1.17)\r\n\r\n6.    Split get_model_arch_and_weights() into query_weights() and get_model_arch()\r\n        So we don't have to transfer weights from segment to master in places\r\n        where we only need the model_arch json\r\n\r\n7. Enables JIT XLA auto-clustering, if available.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n\r\n 8.  Simplified schedule rotation: schedule table is created only once, then gets\r\n      rotated on segments, instead of re-creating many times by transferring\r\n      data back and forth from master to segments to master each hop.  No longer\r\n      need separate \"current_schedule\" and \"grand_schedule\" data structures.\r\n      These tables do not contain model weights, so there is not much of a \r\n      performance benefit, but it's at least simpler and more maintainable.\r\n\r\n9.   Added some debugging that can be enabled to help profile the\r\n      performance of fit multiple, and track on which segment each mst_key\r\n      is located during each hop. This also serves as an example for\r\n      the utils/debug PR this is rebased on top of.\r\n\r\n10.  Remove AutoML dependency on internals of fit_multiple (needed to make AutoML\r\n     compatible with the new FitMultiple class, but also good for avoiding having to\r\n     do the same thing for any future updates to fit_multiple.  Better modularity.\r\n\r\n 11.  Improved Exception handling:  send full stack traceback from segment back to master (soon to be renamed \"coordinator\").  Now when an exception happens in fit_transition (or merge, final, etc.) we'll be able to see the stack trace of the internal UDF or UDA running on the segments, along with the stack trace of the outer UDF that runs on the\r\ncoordinator.  It's attached to the DETAILS of the Exception and includes the line number where the error occurred--something that we had to guess at before, making debugging difficult.\r\n\r\n# Testing Results\r\n\r\nBased on testing on our 20 segment cluster, with 20 VGG16 models, we've seen hop times reduced by a factor of about 5.5x (from 44s down to 8s).  Which shaved nearly 13 minutes off of each iteration (down from 26 minutes to 12 minutes for the smallish dataset we used).  As noted previously, the initialization time for warm start was also 10x faster, reducing overall runtime by an additional 4.5 minutes.  These optimizations can be combined with the caching optimization already merged, ensuring that v1.18 should run much faster on nearly any dataset/model than v1.17.","created_at":"2020-11-19T00:57:42Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T00:18:24Z","closed_at":"2021-01-20T00:18:24Z","merged_at":"2021-01-20T00:18:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"885104d62738877ae0e98c4eccdf2e3c22f5fe68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/2ffebef31f2ff263ec57816d51e468498083db7c","head":{"label":"reductionista:dl/new_flow","ref":"dl/new_flow","sha":"2ffebef31f2ff263ec57816d51e468498083db7c","user":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178961560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg5NjE1NjA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"reductionista/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista/madlib","description":"Mirror

Module name: Linear-Regression\r\n\r\n### JIRA: MADlib-1460\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nLinear regression training results in 2 output tables (**neither are optional**): \r\n\r\nThe **primary** output table, that includes the computed coefficients.\r\nA **summary** output table, that contains a single line.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario\r\n\r\nRunning the linear regression training in postgresql on an input table which has **more than 2^31 records** within it (even if a grouping column is specified), fails due to an \"**integer out of range**\" exception.\r\n\r\n#### Source\r\n\r\n**The summary table** has a column that stores **the total number of records** involved in the computation. The column's data type is a **singed integer**. However, the total number of records is computed as a **BIGINT**. Therefore, when the total number of records in the input table is beyond the range of a signed integer (i.e., 2^31), an \"integer out of range\" exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nA simple solution is to change the data type of the column from a **signed integer** into a **BIGINT**. \r\n\r\n### Test\r\n\r\nWe have executed the linear regression training function with and without the suggested modification on an input table having between 2^31-2^32 records. Without the modification, an integer out of range exception was thrown. After modifying the code as suggested, it worked perfectly. \r\n","created_at":"2020-10-27T10:10:31Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T23:26:04Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T23:26:04Z","merged_at":"2021-01-11T23:26:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0991965f7d4007d47902afcf7b319a78d766613","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/dfcc542b6e8887483227312b1915a06c9918e851","head":{"label":"dadanielniel:linear_regression_train_integer_out_of_range_bug_fix","ref":"linear_regression_train_integer_out_of_range_bug_fix","sha":"dfcc542b6e8887483227312b1915a06c9918e851","user":{"login":"dadanielniel","id":73522466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTIyNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73522466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel","html_url":"https://github.com/dadanielniel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":307640387,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDc2NDAzODc=","name":"madlib","full_name":"dadanielniel/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dadanielniel","id":73522466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTIyNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73522466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel","html_url":"https://github.com/dadanielniel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadanielniel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dadanielniel/madlib","description":"Mirror

are no functional changes in this PR, this is just for making MADlib development and performance profiling easier.\r\n\r\n1. Adds a new collection of utility functions (`utilities/debug.py_in`), to aid with the debugging process.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this new debug module is to make it easy to\r\n    turn on or off certain kinds of debug messages, without needing to make lots of temporary changes to the code.\r\n    There is a frequent debugging pattern which has kept repeating when it comes to performance issues:\r\n       - We find a bug, for example something is running slowly or filling up the disk or memory.  But we don't know where in a long sequence of SQL queriers it's happening.\r\n       - We add lots of different extra lines of code to print out timing information after each query is sent, as well as what the queries look like after all python formatting params have been filled in, what their EXPLAIN plans look like, and sometimes other things... like which models are on which segments after each hop (for the case of `madlib_keras_fit_mutliple`).\r\n       - We check these changes in on a temporary branch, and spend a while investigating, eventually getting a good picture of where the performance bottleneck is.  As we go along, often the types of information getting printed get more complicated and spread out through the code, and these commits get all mixed up with simultaneously commits we're making to actually fix the bug.\r\n        - After a series of tweaks to different stages of the UDF implementation, the performance profiling looks good again, and we declare the bug fixed.\r\n        - Then we sift through a complicated mess of commits, stripping out any debugging changes so they don't get merged in to the production code.\r\n        - Soon after, we find another bug, and now we've got to start putting some debugging statements back in, little by little.  Eventually the whole cycle repeats, and we've done and undone a lot of work many times at this point.\r\n\r\nTo improve the situation, we can build any of the profiling and debugging statements right into the production code, in a way where it can be easily enabled or disabled simply by changing a single line of code.  (In the future, we could even make it a compiler option.)\r\n\r\nHopefully this will speed up the process of tracking down performance bottlenecks and reduce the amount of redundant work repeated.\r\n\r\n    debug.start_timing(msg)`\r\n          Starts a timer.  msg is any name or short description of the timer which can be grepped for later.  Multiple timers can be running simultaneously, and they won't interfere with each other as long as they are each named differently.  This will print a header with column names that can be matched up later with the actual timings as they get printed.\r\n\r\n    debug.print_timing(msg, force=False)` :\r\n           Used to print timing information for different stages of a python UDF (for example, madlib_keras_fit_multiple()).  This will print (or not print) how many seconds have elapsed since this particular timer (associate with msg param) was started. If enabled, it will print a nicely formatted banner with information in different columns that can be easily extracted from logs with the grep and cut commands.  For example, we could use it to break down the current run_training() function into _hop_time_, _uda_time_, _truncate_time_, _copy_time_, and _delete_time_.  I'm not including this example yet because it's on a branch with a major refactor and these particular stages no longer line up.  (Refactor will be raised as a separate PR and call these functions with names appropriate for the new stages.)\r\n\r\n      Enable all timing messages in a source file (just after debug module has been imported):\r\n         debug.timings_enabled = True\r\n\r\n      Enable a single call to debug.print_timings()\r\n         by passing force=True.  Will print even if\r\n         debug.timings_enabled is False\r\n\r\n    debug.print_mst_keys(force=False) :\r\n        If enabled, prints a map between mst_keys and seg_id's as the mst_keys\r\n        hop around from segment to segment... to verify correct\r\n        MOP behavior.\r\n\r\n    debug.plpy.execute(query, ..., force=False)\r\n\r\n        If enabled, prints query, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, and timing of a query\r\n        while executing it.  Otherwise, just runs the query with plpy.execute(query, ...)\r\n\r\n    debug.plpy.info(msg,..., force=False):\r\n       Calls plpy.info(msg, ...) if enabled.\r\n       Otherwise, does nothing.\r\n\r\n    debug.plpy.debug(msg, ..., force=False):\r\n        Behaves like plpy.debug(msg, ...) if disabled (printing only\r\n        if DEBUG level is set high enough), but becomes a\r\n        plpy.info() if enabled.\r\n\r\n2. One minor fix to silence a warning message that started showing up for me recently (I think when I upgraded from pg9 to pg12).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-06T01:43:32Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T20:48:06Z","closed_at":"2021-01-04T20:48:05Z","merged_at":"2021-01-04T20:48:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"39c242185253ebaf8cf9bdd4c67b897fdaff673f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/907a60ef004ffeccfad4d2523cb00a5fffae2ef3","head":{"label":"reductionista:utils/debug","ref":"utils/debug","sha":"907a60ef004ffeccfad4d2523cb00a5fffae2ef3","user":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178961560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg5NjE1NjA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"reductionista/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1447\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue when calling fit multiple model with huge model\r\nweights(JIRA: MADLIB-1414). The fix for that issue was to set\r\n`plan_cache_mode` guc in gpdb6 to `force_generic_plan`. For automl,\r\nsince we directly call madlib_keras_fit_multiple_model from the within\r\nthe automl function, we need to set the GUC plan_cache_mode when calling\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<!--  \r\n\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

MADLIB-1427\r\n\r\nCurrently passing around independent and dependent vars to the\r\ntransition function is what takes up most of the time.\r\nAs part of this PR, a new fit_multipl_transition function is called that\r\nreads all the rows (for each seg) into the cache(SD) for the very first\r\nhop and for each subsequent hop/iteration, the data is read from the\r\ncache instead of table and cleared out at the final training call. This\r\nhelps reduces the time to pass along the data to the transition function.\r\nSince, the data is cached into memory, the memory usage per segment\r\nincreases significantly. To avoid this, a new optional param\r\n`use_caching` is added to madlib_keras_fit_multiple_model(), that can be\r\nset to TRUE if the memory on each segment meets the following\r\ncalculation:\r\n\r\n   IND_SZ (indep var size of each row) = ((image_dimension)*4)*(#of images per buffer)\r\n   DEP_SZ (indep var size of each row) = (#DEP_VAR * 4)*(#of images per buffer)\r\n   memory_data = (#seg_per_host) * (#rows_per_seg * IND_SZ) + (#seg_per_host) * (#rows_per_seg * DEP_SZ)\r\n   memory_model = model_size * #models_per_seg * #seg_per_host\r\n   total_memory = memory_data + memory_model\r\n\r\n<!--  \r\n\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

MADLIB-1451\r\n\r\nThe prob output for predict created a bunch of columns for different\r\nclass values.

MADLIB-{1447,1448,1449}\r\n\r\nWe integrate AutoML capabilities in Apache MADlib by introducing a function called `madlib_keras_automl`, which bridges the worlds of setting and running model selection together, and helps automate and accelerate the model selection and training processes end-to-end. The user can declaratively specify the names of their train/val datasets, mst and output tables, model architecture and param grid details, the chosen method name and associated params, and various training details as desired, and our API handles the scheduling and execution components with the algorithm workload info displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nThe first AutoML algorithm we implement is Hyperband, a state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithm which speeds up random search with adaptive resource allocation, successive halving (SHA) and early stopping. This algorithm generates a schedule with user inputs and evaluates model configurations in a smarter, more efficient way by continually exploring more promising configurations. \r\n\r\nIn the case of MPP databases such as Greenplum, we further accelerate this algorithm by simultaneously evaluating multiple rounds of the algorithm located along a 'diagonal', to keep machines busy and take advantage of the large distributed storage and compute power offered by Greenplum.\r\n\r\nWith the diagonal approach, we introduce some additional low-level optimizations with the implementation related to optimal runtimes and code quality by:\r\n\r\n1. Reducing number of random search function calls from `s_max+1` to just `1`.\r\n2. Reducing number of multiple model training function calls from `s_max(s_max+1)/2` to `s_max+1`.\r\n3. Reducing number of sampled SHA configuration groups from `s_max+1` to `s_max+1-skip_last` (i.e. only sampling the configurations actually needed for evaluation).\r\n4. Abstracting the model training process for every diagonal of Hyperband with the pre-existing `madlib_keras_fit_multiple_model` function, to evaluate models with Model hOpper Parallelism (MOP) and reap the advantages of both data and task parallel workloads/regimes.\r\n\r\nKey:\r\n1. R --> maximum amount of resources/iterations that can be allocated to a single configuration in any particular round of Hyperband\r\n2. eta --> factor controlling the proportion of configs discarded in each round of SHA\r\n3. s_max = `floor(log(R)/log(eta))` --> controls the number of SHA brackets (=`s_max+1`) executed with Hyperband\r\n4. skip_last --> Number of diagonals to skip at the end (to avoid running the most time/resource intensive bracket(s) and/or to avoid overfitting or loss in predictive power). skip_last ∈ [0, s_max]\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-22T01:19:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T19:22:57Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T19:22:57Z","merged_at":"2020-09-11T19:22:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b06bd0eff2063a36fec5b6b865e208b23ebf44f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/39278b6477bf0b8e6a9a44cc3cb830cc78cfe6b7","head":{"label":"Advitya17:dl/madlib_keras_automl_pr","ref":"dl/madlib_keras_automl_pr","sha":"39278b6477bf0b8e6a9a44cc3cb830cc78cfe6b7","user":{"login":"Advitya17","id":37190647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTkwNjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37190647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17","html_url":"https://github.com/Advitya17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":279377663,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzkzNzc2NjM=","name":"madlib","full_name":"Advitya17/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Advitya17","id":37190647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTkwNjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37190647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17","html_url":"https://github.com/Advitya17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Advitya17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Advitya17/madlib","description":"Mirror

   Add conditional support for C++11 compilers.\r\n\r\n    This allows madlib to be compiled on OSX with libc++ and\r\n    other C++11 compilers, and drops the requirement that an old\r\n    version of Boost be used.\r\n    (Previously we required Boost < 1.65 to compile.)\r\n\r\n    On OSX, this gets rid of the need to use either an old version\r\n    of MacOS (Sierra or earlier), download an old version of\r\n    XCode (9.x or earlier), or compile with gcc (the last of which\r\n    is unacceptable for a release version, as it means it will not\r\n    run on MacOS without the user manually

MADLIB-1442\r\n\r\nWe noticed that some MADlib modules drop output tables before\r\nrecreating them.

MADLIB-1439\r\n\r\nThe `load_model_selection_table` function requires the user to manually specify the grid of compile and fit params. Hence, we implement a function called `generate_model_configs` (in the same module) to perform grid/random search.\r\n\r\nThe user would declare the compile and fit params grid separately as strings enveloping python dictionaries, and the name of the search algorithm (along with any corresponding arguments), and the output format of the new function would be the same as the previous one for better integrability with other MADlib functions related to model training etc. \r\n\r\nThis pull request includes the implementation, unit tests (in python and SQL) and documentation for the newly

MADLIB-1017\r\n\r\nThe brute force DBSCAN runs on N^2 time. To improve this,\r\nwe added two layers of indexing.\r\n1. The data is broken into chunks with kd-tree\r\n2. Each leaf of the kd-tree creates an rtree index for\r\nefficient range queries.\r\n\r\nIn addition we added a separate process to reduce the number\r\nof edges to consider during wcc operation.\r\n\r\n<!--  \r\n\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-1441\r\n\r\nFor MADlib deep_learning module to support custom functions, we have the following functions are affected:\r\n1. madlib_keras_fit()\r\n2. madlib_keras_fit_multiple_model()\r\n3. madlib_keras_evaluate()\r\nCurrently the compile_param passed in are like\r\n `optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, nesterov=True), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['mae']`\r\nFor a custom function we would just pass in as follows:\r\n `optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, nesterov=True), loss=custom_fn1, metrics=['mae']` \r\n\r\nObject table definition with a dill object of custom functions is as follows:\r\n|id|name|description|function|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|1|custom_fn1|test function|\\x80026...|\r\n|2|custom_fn2|test function2|\\x8ab26...|\r\n\r\nFor fit_multiple, we want to support multiple configs in mst_table with a mix of custom and keras loss functions:\r\n|mst_key|model_id|compile_params|fit_params|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|2|1|loss='custom_fn1', optimizer=....|batch_size=16, epochs=1|\r\n|3|1|loss='custom_fn2', optimizer=....|batch_size=16, epochs=1|\r\n|1|1|loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=....|batch_size=16, epochs=1|\r\n\r\nFollowing are the relevant API Changes\r\n **Fit**: add a new optional param for passing in the object_table name\r\n object_table (optional) VARCHAR: Name of the table containing Python objects in the case that custom loss functions or custom metrics are specified in the parameter `compile_params\r\n```\r\nmadlib_keras_fit(\r\n    source_table,\r\n    model,\r\n    model_arch_table,\r\n    model_id,\r\n    compile_params,\r\n    fit_params,\r\n    num_iterations,\r\n    use_gpus,\r\n    validation_table,\r\n    metrics_compute_frequency,\r\n    warm_start,\r\n    name,\r\n    description,\r\n    object_table  -- new parameter\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n**Fit_multiple**: No change to the `madlib_keras_fit_multiple_model()` function. Reads object_table information from the model_selection table.\r\n A summary table named <model>_summary is also created, which has the following new columns:\r\n|model_selection_table |Name of the table containing model selection parameters to be tried.|\r\n|object_table| Name of the object table containing the serialized Python objects for custom loss functions and custom metrics (read from the mst_summary table).|\r\n\r\n**Evaluate**: No change to the `madlib_keras_evaluate()` function. Reads object_table information from the model table. Output table adds a new column\r\n|loss_type|Type of loss used that was used in the training step\r\n If a custom loss or metric is used, we should give the name of it. Otherwise list the built-in one used|\r\n<!--  \r\n\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1.

MADLIB-1414\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the previous commit for avoiding constant folding of weights in GPDB6 plans. Instead, there is a GUC introduced in GPDB6(`plan_cache_mode`) that allows controlling whether to choose generic plan(not constant folding the passed in params)/custom plans(constant folding the passed in params) for execution. This PR uses this GUC for choosing generic plan for GPDB6 execution.\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in the way `class_values` were populated in fit multiple's summary table; it would fail when the class_values had `NULL` values in the array.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For the prior versions of GPDB6, where this GUC doesn't exist, the DL queries will fail with `memory alloc` error for those versions.  \r\n\r\n- [X] Add the module name, JIRA# to PR/commit and description.\r\n- [X] Add tests for the change.

commit removes 2 problematic tests that we decided weren't worth including in the DL dev-check tests.\r\n\r\nOne of these tests was checking to make sure that `madlib_keras_fit()` fails when you pass `use_gpus=True`. And the other does the same for `madlib_keras_predict()`.  This wasn't a problem originally because we usually run dev-check only on Jenkins or other docker images where there are no GPU's. But as we continue to improve our pre-release testing process, we'd like to have dev-check be able to pass on GPU-enabled test platforms as well. So these tests are no longer appropriate.","created_at":"2020-03-11T23:04:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T17:59:12Z","closed_at":"2020-03-16T17:59:12Z","merged_at":"2020-03-16T17:59:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"c62dfe7c7c1dcd4c604def51fc0a6f9fa84f7d5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/525218942453b114853d1526c1d85b6456de6063","head":{"label":"reductionista:remove_test_for_no_gpu","ref":"remove_test_for_no_gpu","sha":"525218942453b114853d1526c1d85b6456de6063","user":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178961560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg5NjE1NjA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"reductionista/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1412\r\n\r\nmfvsketch merge function did not filter out duplicate entries if\r\na value is in the mfv list for multiple segments.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by keeping a list of added values and\r\nfiltering out duplicate entries.\r\n\r\nWe also noticed the use of memcmp() for comparing two Datums to\r\ncheck for equality.  There is a note in the postgres/gpdb source\r\nsaying this is unsafe, so we converted it over to calling the\r\npostgres function datumIsEqual() which can handle either\r\nlittle-endian or big-endian byte order, making it more portable.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Orhan Kislal <okislal@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nCloses #\r\n\r\n<!--  \r\n\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

[MADLIB-1410](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-1410)\r\n\r\n[Current implementation of `file` output parsing](https://github.com/apache/madlib/blob/fc81374d4d280ab4454150cb126137775e0f7ae6/cmake/Utils.cmake#L71) does not parse the architecture names properly.\r\n\r\n`file` command output is kernel-dependent. On Linux, the widest used implementation is http://www.darwinsys.com/file/. The definitions of its outputs for ELF files for the most recent version can be found at https://github.com/file/file/blob/master/magic/Magdir/elf.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements proper parsing of these outputs and their conversion to Mac OS `lipo` format.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nNot sure the `lipo` architecture format is the correct choice, but I suppose its values may currently be expected in various places.\r\n\r\nI would propose the following:\r\n* Introduce some \"unknown\" architecture in order not to limit architecture support. Not sure this is possible without extra changes, though.\r\n* Remove [`word_length`](https://github.com/apache/madlib/blob/fc81374d4d280ab4454150cb126137775e0f7ae6/cmake/Utils.cmake#L99) CMake macro. As far as I understand, it is currently not used anywhere.\r\n* Rewrite the architecture recognition CMake macro `architecture` and use `file` both on Mac OS and on Linux. This would simplify the parsing logic of the macro, and it would allow to determine word length directly (`file` output contains it) instead of hardcoding it in `word_length`.","created_at":"2020-02-12T18:20:16Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T19:57:46Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T19:57:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"821d6600f87ca9cc7cdd2adfad65e22f15577b5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/5fd815f2eb47ed15e0764f01c3178b73156d40fe","head":{"label":"arenadata:determine_architecture_by_file_fix","ref":"determine_architecture_by_file_fix","sha":"5fd815f2eb47ed15e0764f01c3178b73156d40fe","user":{"login":"arenadata","id":25401583,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI1NDAxNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25401583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata","html_url":"https://github.com/arenadata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":240018975,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDAwMTg5NzU=","name":"madlib","full_name":"arenadata/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arenadata","id":25401583,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI1NDAxNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25401583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata","html_url":"https://github.com/arenadata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arenadata/madlib","description":"Mirror

[MADLIB-1410](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-1410)\r\n\r\nImplement a check that `-mno-sse2` option is available for the chosen GNU CXX compiler. This [is a platform-specific option](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.5/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html) and should not be set on machines with architectures that do not support it.\r\n\r\nThis requires a new CMake module `CheckCXXCompilerFlag`. It [is available in CMake 2.8.4](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.4/cmake.html), which is the lowest currently supported CMake version.\r\n\r\nAn extra CMake variable, `SSE_DISABLE_OPTIONS`, is introduced to hold options required for GNU CXX compilers that support SSE-specific options.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe implemented mechanism is just one of multiple possible implementations. For example, one could check the target system architecture instead of using `CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG`. In addition, CMake itself has several implementation options, with the same result.","created_at":"2020-02-12T18:04:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T01:19:44Z","closed_at":"2020-02-13T01:19:44Z","merged_at":"2020-02-13T01:19:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"05a6e51463fdd619151a8ecaabc1e659b9dfa3c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/70f1f6f307fb6f3d66318f058ea1d0ac5359258c","head":{"label":"arenadata:no_sse_flag_check","ref":"no_sse_flag_check","sha":"70f1f6f307fb6f3d66318f058ea1d0ac5359258c","user":{"login":"arenadata","id":25401583,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI1NDAxNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25401583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata","html_url":"https://github.com/arenadata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":240018975,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDAwMTg5NzU=","name":"madlib","full_name":"arenadata/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arenadata","id":25401583,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI1NDAxNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25401583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata","html_url":"https://github.com/arenadata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arenadata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arenadata/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1405\r\n\r\nFor versions >=GPDB6, previously, for queries called with the initial\r\nweights value passed in, the query plan for it would have create custom\r\nplans with weights embedded in the plan itself.  This meant that the\r\nquery plan size would also include the size of these weights, bloating\r\nit up to hit the 1GB limit when dispatching the query plan to segments,\r\nleading to OOM for large weights.\r\n\r\nIn GPDB, for PREPARE plans, there is a threshold of 5 attempts to create\r\ncustom plans(constant folding the passed in params) for execution and\r\nthen it uses a generic plan(not constant folding the passed in params)\r\nfor all the subsequent executions.  Therefore, to avoid GPDB6 from\r\ncreating custom plans when passing in weights, the queries(with weights)\r\nis executed with DUMMY weights for 5 time, prior to calling it with the\r\nactual weights.\r\n\r\n<!--  \r\n\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

MADLIB-1334\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the following optimizations to the minibatch preprocessor:\r\n\r\n- Skip normalization if normalizing constant is 1.0\r\n\r\n- Split the batching query to generate buffer_id's (based of row_id)\r\nwithout moving around any data. Previously, calling `ROW_NUMBER()\r\nOVER()` to add row_id's to the table was causing the data to be gathered\r\non the master node and then numbering the rows, which for large datasets\r\nwould be taking most of the time.\r\n\r\n- Separate out the JOIN (called for even distribution) as well as\r\nconverting to BYTEA from the batching query. This avoids some VMEM limit\r\nissues we were seeing.\r\n\r\n- `num_buffers` gets rounded up to the nearest multiple of `num_segments`\r\nfor even distribution across buffers on segments.\r\n\r\n- Add new C function `array_to_bytea()` to convert array to `bytea`, and\r\nsome tests for it.  This is much faster than the python version we were\r\nusing, speeding up the query significantly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit adds a new function `plpy_execute()` that\r\nprints `EXPLAIN` plans and execution time for debugging.","created_at":"2020-01-01T01:34:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-11T21:08:11Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T02:06:57Z","merged_at":"2020-01-10T02:06:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"85eba2968b5651b6242a398df569b1f3f6412703","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/2dd33ff7a1ce6058254ee49a5613079cf2759d30","head":{"label":"reductionista:dl/preprocessor_optimization","ref":"dl/preprocessor_optimization","sha":"2dd33ff7a1ce6058254ee49a5613079cf2759d30","user":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178961560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg5NjE1NjA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"reductionista/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1334\r\n\r\nUsing real[] instead of anyarray for agg_array_concat solves the scaling\r\nproblem i.e. running input preprocessor on same dataset with different\r\nbuffer sizes results in comparable runtimes. This is because the plan\r\nfor the agg with real[] aggregates on the segments and then gathers on\r\nthe master but the plan for the agg with anyarray aggregate first\r\ngathers all the data on the master and then runs the aggregate function\r\non the master.\r\n\r\nHere are the results from my local mac with gpdb 5.21 3 segments\r\n\r\n```\r\nmnist 10k rows anyarray agg\r\nmadlib=# select

PR adds a new function to train multiple models in parallel\r\nwith model hopping method supported for Greenplum DB only.\r\n\r\nModel hopping method involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n- Train models in parallel for a single epoch using the data local\r\nto each segment.\r\n- Move the models to the next segment in round-robin fashion.\r\n\r\nThis method ensures that all of the models visit the entire dataset,\r\nwhich eliminates the need to average the model at the end.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the following issue:\r\n-  In the regular fit function, excessive amounts of threads were being\r\ncreated and left over by keras sessions. This issue was fixed by reusing\r\nthe same session and the same computational graph throughout the\r\nprocess.\r\n- While deserializing weights, if the model shape expected less elements\r\nthan present in the weights, the extra weights would get truncated.\r\nThis is fixed by adding an explicit check for validating number of\r\nelements in model weights matches the model.","created_at":"2019-09-17T20:33:55Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T21:52:24Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T21:52:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26d667b1f9969fc76d982dcac99c70322904e674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/bc95d6e08a9d5c082e9e8629acadab48d69dca5a","head":{"label":"khannaekta:dl/fit_multi_model","ref":"dl/fit_multi_model","sha":"bc95d6e08a9d5c082e9e8629acadab48d69dca5a","user":{"login":"khannaekta","id":15749573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzQ5NTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15749573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta","html_url":"https://github.com/khannaekta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":175877970,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzU4Nzc5NzA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"khannaekta/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khannaekta","id":15749573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzQ5NTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15749573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta","html_url":"https://github.com/khannaekta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khannaekta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khannaekta/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1381\r\n\r\nThe utility function `load_model_selection_table()` assumes that there\r\nis only 1 model architecture table (passed in as a parameter).\r\nTherefore, it should not be added to the output table.\r\nThis PR removes `model_arch_table` column from the output table of\r\n`load_model_selection_table()` and creates a summary table with this\r\ncolumn instead.\r\nAlso, added tests and split the unit test

simple PR:\r\n\r\nRename `madlib_keras_fit_multiple_model.*` to `madlib_keras_model_selection.*` so that once we merge in the `fit_multiple_models` code from #425, they will each have separate user-doc pages.  This will allow more flexibility to expand the current helper function into a more advanced model management utility.\r\n\r\nOther minor changes:\r\n\r\n- improves validation of input params `fit_params_list` and `compile_params_list` (checks for NULL values, reports error).\r\n- added `.vscode` to `.gitignore` for anyone using Visual Studio
