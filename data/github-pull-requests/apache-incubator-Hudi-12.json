Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently `show_fsview_all` support set `path_regex`, e.g.\r\n```sql\r\ncall show_fsview_all(table => '$tableName', path_regex => 'day=d1/hh=h2')\r\ncall show_fsview_all(table => '$tableName', path_regex => 'day=d1/*/')\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile `show_fsview_latest` only support set `partition_path`, e.g.\r\n```sql\r\ncall show_fsview_latest(table => '$tableName', partition_path => 'day=d1/hh=h2')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR make `show_fsview_latest` support `path_regex` too, In fact, `partition_path` can be completely replaced by  `path_regex`, but for compatibility with old versions, we keep it\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n`show_fsview_latest` support  `path_regex`\r\n\r\nOther fixs:\r\n\r\n- change `partition_path` in `show_fsview_latest` from required to optional\r\n- fix `call show_fsview_latest` when no commits in timeline\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nwill update the doc of `call show_fsview_latest`\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

fallbackToKeyBasedBuffer(). This conversion is not completely effective because delete records may not have key stored. We set a flag \"needToDoHybridStrategy\" to true and then handle this issue when merging with the base file. We don't remove those records from the map. We know that there will not be any collisions because positions are stored as long and recordkeys are stored as string. When we merge with the base file, we get the position from the base record and search the map for it. If we find a record, then we know it is a delete because only deletes have this issue. Additionally, we know that this delete is the most recent version of the record. That is because we process logs from newest to oldest. And these deletes occurred before the fallback. Therefore, they are newer than any versions of the record with a key.  Additionally, since deletes with positions don't have source ordering, we apply overwrite with latest logic. Finally, we get the key from the base record and delete it from the map if there is another occurrence of it. \r\n\r\nIn shouldSkip, I moved the check for keys.isEmpty to the beginning so that we don't need to read the recordkey from the record each time. \r\n\r\nI added TestPositionBasedMergingFallback to test different scenarios where we need to fallback\r\n\r\nI modified TestCustomMerger and TestEventTimeMerging to also test position based merging and position based fallback. Additionally, I added TestOverwriteWithLatestMerger so that we could test position only deletes and hybrid merge strategy.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nReads with position merging will not fail if there

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPosition merging was removed in [HUDI-7567](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10957)\r\nbut will now be added back with additional testing and proper use of filters.\r\n\r\nAdd position based merging for bootstrap.\r\n\r\nSome filters can be pushed down if we have record positions for bootstrap. We exclude any filters that involve both the skeleton file and base file.\r\n\r\nNo filters can be pushed down for MOR except required filters. I think required filters need to be investigated more in a followup ticket as well.\r\n\r\nAdd HoodiePositionBasedSchemaHandler to add position column to the schema if appropriate. That case is when the reader context supports adding record positions. As opposed to shouldUseRecordPosition which is controlled by a config and can be used even when record positions are not supported by the reader context.\r\n\r\nAdded tests for choosing bootstrap filters. Also added functional tests to ensure bootstrap and mor do not push down filters when they are not supposed to. SQLConf.PARQUET_RECORD_FILTER_ENABLED must be enabled to test this properly as I did in the test. \r\n\r\nAdded back the test files with some minor modifications: TestSpark35RecordPositionMetadataColumn\r\nTestHoodiePositionBasedFileGroupRecordBuffer\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\npositional merge feature added back to fg reader.\r\nBootstrap reading can be sped up with positional merging\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\nwrote tests\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-07T02:33:46Z","updated_at":"2024-06-07T23:47:42Z","closed_at":"2024-06-07T23:47:42Z","merged_at":"2024-06-07T23:47:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d7cc87d687bd235bac099e481535cb9f223b501","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCalcite is used at `TestParquetColumnProjection`. Currently Hudi uses calcite comes from Hadoop transitively while hadoop3+  has removed calcite from their project. We should switch to use scala.math.scala to avoid depending on calcite\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd new method getNextCheckpointWithPredicates in abstract class SnapshotLoadQuerySplitter for retrieving the next checkpoint along with file pruning predicates (partition filters etc.) for optimising snapshot query. These predicates help us in identifying the parquet files as part of the buildScan stage in spark data source.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact to existing API, new functionality being added for retrieving the next checkpoint with predicate filters. Null or Empty predicates are handled to ensure backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor now, all uses of `initTestServices()` are with `needsHdfs=false`, `needsHive=false`, `needsZookeeper=false`, except `HoodieDeltaStreamerTestBase`, where `needsHive=true`. So there is no problem with `initTestServices()` for now. But if we switch `needsZookeeper` to `true`, then we will face errors of Hive connection to Zookeeper in `HoodieDeltaStreamerTestBase`.\r\nCorrect order of services start:\r\n1. Zookeeper\r\n2. HDFS\r\n3. Hive\r\n\r\nAlso fixed `cleanUpUtilitiesTestServices()` ordering, in reverse to corresponding initializations.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDeltastreamer changes to add support for reading kafka commit offsets from Kafka instead of Hoodie Commit Timeline.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe change will not have any impact unless the config flag `--disable-hoodie-commit-checkpoint` is added.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNew config added : `--disable-hoodie-commit-checkpoint`.\r\nIf this flag is provided, then the Deltastreamer will not read the start offset from the hoodie commit timeline and get it from the source (Kafka commit offset for example). This may not be used for DFS or sources where the source can not keep track of the consumer offset. With kafka source, this might need additional configuration `hoodie.deltastreamer.source.kafka.enable.commit.offset=true` and `auto.offset.reset=group` so that kafka is committed appropriately and offset is fetched from the kafka group.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhenever a savepoint is removed, cleaner should resort to do entire partition cleaning instead of incr cleaning. We already attempted a fix https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10651, but it had a bug where not all partitions were accounted for. Whenever a savepoint is removed, cleaner should just resort to full partition cleaning. Anyways, savepoint meta files are deleted and savepoint will be tracking every latest base file for every partition, it makes sense to do entire partition list cleaning.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhenever a savepoint is removed, cleaner should resort to do entire partition cleaning instead of incr cleaning. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis patch is for branch-0-x. Master patch https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11343\r\nWe can't let clean action executor skip files to be deleted. Due to networking glitches, there are chances some files may not be cleaned up. As of now, clean action execution succeeds and is tracked as part of \"failedDeleteFiles\". But if files to be deleted does not exists or already cleaned up, we are good. but if file deletion fails due to some other exception, we can't go past the issue. It could cause data consistency issues once the commit of interest goes into archived timeline (specifically incase of replace commits). So, this patch fixes the flow, where in clean action executor will ensure all intended files will be deleted for sure. On any exception, clean execution will fail. \r\n\r\nAdded tests to cover below scenario:\r\n1. fs.delete returns true\r\n2. fs.delete returns false. fs.exists returns false\r\n3. fs.delete return false, fs.exists returns true (clean execution is expected to fail)\r\n4. fs.delete throws FileNotFoundException\r\n5. fs.delete throws Runtime exception (clean execution is expected to fail)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRobust clean action. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPR targeting master: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11355\r\nThis PR targets at `branch-0.x` with the same set of changes.\r\n\r\nWith Hudi 0.14.1 release, without the Spark config `spark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.spark.HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar`, Hudi queries in the Hudi Spark quick start guide succeed.  In Hudi 0.15.0-rc2, without the Kryo registratrar, the Hudi queries start to throw NPE (see the stacktrace below), due to `HadoopStorageConfiguration` not properly broadcasted and serded.  To maintain the same user experience without requiring the Spark config `spark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.spark.HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar` by default, this PR reverts the changes of `HadoopStorageConfiguration` usage in Spark broadcasts and uses `org.apache.spark.util.SerializableConfiguration` instead for broadcasting the Hadoop configuration.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDriver

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith Hudi 0.14.1 release, without the Spark config `spark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.spark.HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar`, Hudi queries in the Hudi Spark quick start guide succeed.  In Hudi 0.15.0-rc2, without the Kryo registratrar, the Hudi queries start to throw NPE (see the stacktrace below), due to `HadoopStorageConfiguration` not properly broadcasted and serded.  To maintain the same user experience without requiring the Spark config `spark.kryo.registrator=org.apache.spark.HoodieSparkKryoRegistrar` by default, this PR reverts the changes of `HadoopStorageConfiguration` usage in Spark broadcasts and uses `org.apache.spark.util.SerializableConfiguration` instead for broadcasting the Hadoop configuration.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDriver

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen multiple writers trigger table services, there is a chance that one of them could create requested in a different ordering compared to the actual timestamp. Linkedin jira has more details of the scenario w/ an illustration. This patch, ensure that before creating a requested entry in the timeline, there is no other instant greater than the current instant time. \r\n\r\nMajor reason is, a writer could generate a new commit time in memory (say t10), and then take a long time to do some computation and eventually add the requested instant to timeline very late (say t100). In b/w these two time, there could be another concurrent writer choosing t25 as commit time and proceed. This might lead to unexpected behaviors as called out in the jira.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo unintended gaps wrt multi-writers and timestamp ordering intricacies. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe can't let clean action executor skip files to be deleted. Due to networking glitches, there are chances some files may not be cleaned up. As of now, clean action execution succeeds and is tracked as part of \"failedDeleteFiles\". But if files to be deleted does not exists or already cleaned up, we are good. but if file deletion fails due to some other exception, we can't go past the issue. It could cause data consistency issues once the commit of interest goes into archived timeline (specifically incase of replace commits). So, this patch fixes the flow, where in clean action executor will ensure all intended files will be deleted for sure. On any exception, clean execution will fail. \r\n\r\nAdded tests to cover below scenario:\r\n1. fs.delete returns true\r\n2. fs.delete returns false. fs.exists returns false\r\n3. fs.delete return false, fs.exists returns true (clean execution is expected to fail)\r\n4. fs.delete throws FileNotFoundException\r\n5. fs.delete throws Runtime exception (clean execution is expected to fail)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRobust clean action. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the
