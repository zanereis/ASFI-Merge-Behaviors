fix #14515.\r\n\r\nI saw 3 ways of fixing it:\r\n1. do a DB migration to represent an infinite pool with `maxint` slots instead of `-1`.\r\n2. do the same thing but at runtime in `slots_stats`.\r\n3. get `_executable_task_instances_to_queued` to understand `-1` pools, changing all code operating on `pool_slots_free` and `open_slots ` [#](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L908) [#](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L975) [#](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L992) [#](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1045) [#](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1060)\r\n\r\nAs to why I chose 2:\r\n1. could be a decent alternative but it's a DB migration with all the complexities inherent to it.\r\n2. is relatively non-intrusive: it's almost free to do it at runtime and it keeps the change completely in the core Python part of Airflow ( in case someone out there directly creates pools by inserting them in his DB 😨 )\r\n3. has the benefit of truly handling infinite pools but I doubt anyone has reached a scale where it matters ( we're talking about a pool with `9223372036854775807` slots here on my system ), plus it increases the overall complexity of that function which is close to the core of the scheduler, we might as well try to keep it as lean as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-07T09:43:29Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T08:31:05Z","closed_at":"2021-06-22T08:31:05Z","merged_at":"2021-06-22T08:31:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"96f764389eded9f1ea908e899b54bf00635ec787","assignee":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"d

commit modifies the worker template to allow passing a non-default deployment update strategy to worker deployments, in particular celery workers. The values have been set to allow 100% `maxSurge` and 50% `maxUnavailable` allowing new deployments of celery workers to launch a full set of replicas before the old set goes away. Allowing the new workers to pick up work as quickly as possible, rather than the current default which is 1 at a time.\r\n\r\n`maxSurge` is the number of pods that will be scheduled beyond the replica count during a rolling deploy. You can specify specific values or percentages. For example if you set the `Marburger to 100% and had 4 replicas, when a rolling deployment started it would launch 4 new pods and then scale down the old ones as the new ones came online.\r\n\r\nThis is explained here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-update-deployment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR sets Pythong 3.6 specific limits for some of the packages\r\nthat recently dropped support for Python 3.6 binary packages\r\nreleased via PyPI. Even if those packages did not drop the\r\nPython 3.6 support entirely, it gets more and more difficult to\r\nget those packages installed (both locally and in the Docker image)\r\nbecause the require the packages to be compiled and they often\r\nrequire a number of external dependencies to do so.\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to automatically upgrade dependencies,\r\nbecause such upgrade fails for Python 3.6 images if we attempt\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nThis PR limits several of those dependencies (dask/pandas/numpy)\r\nto not use the lates major releases for those packages but limits\r\nthem to the latest released versions.\r\n\r\nAlso comment/clarification was added to recently (#15114) added limit\r\nfor `pandas-gbq`. This limit has been added because of broken\r\nimport for bigquery provider, but the comment about it was missing\r\nso the comment is added now.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the case where a child process is reaped early (before we get to it) the presumption in the code is that it is due to an OOM error and either we or psutil set the return code to `-9`. This adds an error message alongside that return code to make it more obvious.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a test that checks this overall functionality, and in the process of doing that switches the StandardTaskRunner tests to use `pytest`-style tests rather than a TestCase, as otherwise we can't use the `caplog` fixture.

I tried to follow the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst) guide step by step. It passed all the pre-commit tests.\r\n\r\nMy PR adds a description field for the Airflow variables that can only be set and seen trhough the UI. Also, I would prefer to have created a `textarea class` instead of an `input class` but I wasn't able to find a way to do it. Any advice on that will be appreciated. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

checking the test status of various CI tests we came to\r\nconclusion that Presto integration took a lot of memory (~1GB)\r\nand was the main source of failures during integration tests,\r\nespecially with MySQL8. The attempt to fine-tune the memory\r\nused turned out in the discovery, that Presto DB stopped\r\npublishing their Docker image (prestosql/presto) - apparently\r\nafter the aftermath of splitting-off Trino from Presto.\r\n\r\nTh split-off was already discussed in #14281 and it was planned\r\nto add support for Trino (which is the more community-driven\r\nfork of the Presto - Presto remained at Facebook Governance,\r\nwhere Trino is an effort continued by the original creators.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about it in the announcement:\r\nhttps://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html. While\r\nPresto continues their way under The Linux Foundation, Trino\r\nlives its own live and keeps on maintaining all artifacts and\r\nlibraries (including the image). That allowed us to update\r\nour tests and decrease the memory footprint by around 400MB.\r\n\r\nThis commit:\r\n\r\n* adds the new Trino provider\r\n* removes `presto` integration and replaces it with `trino`\r\n* the `trino` integartion image is built with 400MB less memory\r\n  requirementes and published as `apache/airflow:trino-*`\r\n* moves the integration tests from Presto to Trino\r\n\r\nFixes: #14281\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR fixes a problem introduced by #14144\r\n\r\nThis is a very weird and unforeseen issue. The change introduced a\r\nnew import from flask `before_render_template` and this caused\r\nflask to require `blinker` dependency, even if it was not\r\nspecified before as 'required' by flask. We have not seen it\r\nbefore, because changes to this part of the code do not trigger\r\nK8S tests, however subsequent PRs started to fail because\r\nthe setup.py did not have `blinker` as dependency.\r\n\r\nHowever in CI image `blinker` was installed because it is\r\nneeded by sentry. So the problem was only detectable in the\r\nproduction image.\r\n\r\nThis is an ultimate proof that our test harness is really good in\r\ncatchig this kind of errors.\r\n\r\nThe root cause for it is described in\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38491075/flask-testing-signals-not-supported-error\r\n\r\nFlask support for signals is optional and it does not blinker as\r\ndependency, but importing some parts of flask triggers the need\r\nfor signals.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds the ability to import connections from a file.\r\n\r\nThis implementation enables basic import functionality, mirroring what already exists for variables. There's room for additional features in future (as proposed in #9907 discussion), but I believe it's reasonable to add those extra features as incremental improvements in a future PR. For example:\r\n\r\n- handling conflict disposition consistently for variables and connections\r\n- accepting input from stdin\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the event of a conflict, the connection to be imported is skipped and a message is printed to stdout indicating to the user that there's a conflict. Any connections without conflicts are still imported.\r\n\r\ncloses:

@potiuk worked on building docs in parallel and managed to do so, but used a lot of Docker tricks. https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/build_docs.py\r\n\r\nI would like to present another workaround that patches only one function from `sphinx-autoapi` and does not change the rest of the process. This simplifies the build process and makes it independent of Docker.  You can use Docker to run a documentation build if you want, but it's not required.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#15144. That's my first pr. Here is the main idea of the feature. The handler reads the timestamp of Cloudwatch events. So timestamp can be seen on the `Log` page of the task. Also I wanted to add a support of `DEFAULT_UI_TIMEZONE` here. Basically to format UTC timestamp with respect to specified UI timezone. However i found only the code that resolves `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`. So i used it for now. Also i'm making `event_dt` as naive right before formatting in order to remove timezone information in logs. \r\n\r\nSo my main question is is it fine to use `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` for formatting of the timestamps? Or there should be similar resolver for `DEFAULT_UI_TIMEZONE` and timestamps are formatted with respect to specified ui timezone?","created_at":"2021-04-03T10:00:23Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T08:35:27Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T08:35:24Z","merged_at":"2021-05-14T08:35:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"1467046058c40f6d448a24b6cda43c2037180c41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xinbinhuang","id":27927454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI3NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27927454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

the KubernetesPodOperator uses the pod_launcher class in airflow core. This means that if we need to fix a bug in the KubernetesPodOperator such as #15137 then the new cncf.kubernetes package will require an Airflow upgrade. Since we hope to release providers in a much faster cadence than Airflow core releases, we should separate this dependency.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

This PR adds retries to handle Kubernetes API Exceptions while trying to start a pod. \r\n\r\n\r\nI've opted for a random exponential backoff since the issues we've been seeing have been the result of too many simultaneous requests, so using a retry without jitter could lead to just repeating the same race conditions over and over. \r\n\r\nThis will only retry in the event of HTTP 409 reponses from the kubernetes API, but can be easily extended if there's more Exceptions which should be handled.\r\n\r\nI'll try to run some experiments this morning to replicate the original issue and confirm that this fixes things. \r\n\r\n### Experiments / Validation:\r\n(All run on Airflow 2.0.1, Kubernetes version 1.18.15-gke.1500)\r\n\r\nI wrote a simple DAG to launch 50 pods at the same time, and let it run for a few hours:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import models\r\nfrom airflow import utils\r\nfrom airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.kubernetes_pod import KubernetesPodOperator\r\n\r\nNUM_TASKS = 50\r\n\r\ndag = models.DAG(\r\n    'data-infrastructure-examples.launch-many-pods',\r\n    start_date=utils.dates.days_ago(1),\r\n    max_active_runs=1,\r\n    dagrun_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10),\r\n    schedule_interval='*/5 * * * *',\r\n    concurrency=NUM_TASKS\r\n)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(NUM_TASKS):\r\n    task = KubernetesPodOperator(namespace='data-infrastructure-examples',\r\n                                            image=\"busybox\",\r\n                                            name=\"hello-world-pod\",\r\n                                            in_cluster=True,\r\n                                            task_id=f\"TASK_{i}\",\r\n                                            get_logs=True,\r\n                                            dag=dag,\r\n                                            arguments=['sleep', '60'],\r\n                                            is_delete_operator_pod=True\r\n                                            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nI let this run for a few hours and was able to replicate the sporadic failures due to 409s observed in the original issue:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16950874/113336496-7eaeea00-92f4-11eb-9ab4-4cc9390260ac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time I ran a different version with the fixes from this PR applied to the pod_launcher.

fix for this was very easy -- just a `timer` -> `timed` typo.\n\nHowever it turns out that the tests for airflow.stats were insufficient\nand didn't catch this, so I have extended the tests in two ways:\n\n1. Test all the other stat methods than just incr (guage, timer, timing,\n   decr)\n2. Use \"auto-specing\" feature of Mock to ensure that we can't make up\n   methods to call on a mock object.\n\n   > Autospeccing is based on the existing spec feature of mock.\n   > It limits the api of mocks to the api of an original object (the\n   > spec), but it is recursive (implemented lazily) so that attributes of\n   > mocks only have the same api as the attributes of the spec. In\n   > addition mocked functions / methods have the same call signature as\n   > the original so they raise a TypeError if they are called\n   > incorrectly.\n\nFixed #14839\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

this change we don't need to add a `LatestOnlyOperator` ensure that a task will skip in a backfill.\r\n\r\nNow, we can just set the parameter `latest_only=True`.\r\n\r\nWe don't deprecate LatestOnlyOperator here -- its behavior is somewhat different because it skips downstream tasks irrespective of trigger rule (I _think_) while this lets any task skip _itself_, and downstream tasks may or may not also therefore skip depending on trigger rules.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, though, this will save users from adding an extra task to dags.  IMHO, setting latest only behavior directly on the task itself is also more direct and more intuitive than setting it via a separate task.","created_at":"2021-04-01T05:13:47Z","updated_at":"2021-11-14T09:07:06Z","closed_at":"2021-11-14T00:06:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2e0480e5b785c529a5bfca1034decea68756931","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github

(active):\r\n \"MainThread\"\r\n    _send (multiprocessing/connection.py:368)\r\n    _send_bytes (multiprocessing/connection.py:411)\r\n    send (multiprocessing/connection.py:206)\r\n    send_callback_to_execute (airflow/utils/dag_processing.py:283)\r\n    _send_dag_callbacks_to_processor (airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py:1795)\r\n    _schedule_dag_run (airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py:1762)\r\n\r\n Process 77: airflow scheduler -- DagFileProcessorManager Python v3.8.7\r\n (/usr/local/bin/python3.8) Thread 0x7FF5C09C8740 (active): \"MainThread\"\r\n    _send (multiprocessing/connection.py:368)\r\n    _send_bytes (multiprocessing/connection.py:405)\r\n    send (multiprocessing/connection.py:206)\r\n    _run_parsing_loop (airflow/utils/dag_processing.py:698)\r\n    start (airflow/utils/dag_processing.py:596)\r\n ```\r\n\r\n What this shows is that both processes are stuck trying to send data to \r\n each other, but neither can proceed as both buffers are full, but since \r\n both are trying to send, neither side is going to read and make more space\r\n in the buffer. A classic deadlock!\r\n\r\n The fix for this is two fold:\r\n\r\n 1) Enable non-blocking IO on the DagFileProcessorManager side.\r\n\r\n    The only thing the Manager sends back up the pipe is (now, as of 2.0)\r\n   the DagParsingStat object, and the scheduler will happily continue\r\n   without receiving these, so in the case of a blocking error, it is\r\n   simply better to ignore the error, continue the loop and try sending\r\n   one again later.\r\n\r\n 2) Reduce the size of DagParsingStat\r\n\r\n    In the case of a large number of dag files we included the path for\r\n   each and every one (in full) in _each_ parsing stat. Not only did the\r\n   scheduler do nothing with this field, meaning it was larger than it\r\n   needed to be, by making it such a large object, it increases the\r\n   likely hood of hitting this send-buffer-full deadlock case!\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of the main advantages of using AWS Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically create secrets of RDS databases and Redshift databases. Those secrets consist of several keys with their values, i.e user, pass, etc. Also, it is normal to store API Keys, sftp, or whatever using different values, as shown in the picture below:\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2020-05-22 a las 10 41 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11339132/82648933-c23ac100-9c18-11ea-9f7c-6a36d0333bbe.png)\r\n\r\nWith the current code, all the keys and values obtained from a secret are stored in the schema attribute of the conn object, unless you have just one key with the conn_uri in the value. Thus, the current situation is forcing to use Secrets Manager in a way it is not intended to.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed modification, you can use AWS Secrets Manager using keys and values and have some kind of freedom to choose different words for each key to make the get_conn work.\r\n\r\nI need help and guidance with tests, please.

Overview\r\n\r\nPRs #15013 and #13934  raise the issue that airflow's conn uri format cannot handle arbitrary json values.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with connections that we can define in the web UI that are impossible to serialize to URI format (see #13934).\r\n\r\nAnd with some secrets backends using json serialization instead of URI, this leaves us with an inconsistency -- some backends can produce connections where `extra_dejson` is a nested dict; others cannot.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for nested json within the URI format without breaking backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### URI generation\r\n\r\nWhen generating the URI, the method `get_uri` will check whether the `extra` can be simply urlencoded without loss or error.  \r\n\r\nIf so, it will use traditional urlencoding.\r\n\r\nWhen loss or error would occur, `get_uri` will serialize the full dict to json and store under query param `__extra__`.\r\n\r\n### URI parsing\r\n\r\nFirst airflow will check for the existence of special query param `__extra__`.  If it exists, airflow will parse it.\r\n\r\nIf this param is not present, the traditional approach is used.\r\n\r\n## More background\r\n\r\nHere's example given in #15013:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> Connection(conn_id='id', conn_type='http', extra='foobar').get_uri()\r\n[2021-03-25 13:31:07,535] {connection.py:337} ERROR - Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/da.lum/code/python/airflow/airflow/models/connection.py\", line 335, in extra_dejson\r\n    obj = json.loads(self.extra)\r\n  File \"/nix/store/8kzdflq0v06fq0mh9m2fd73gnyqp57xr-python3-3.7.3/lib/python3.7/json/__init__.py\", line 348, in loads\r\n    return _default_decoder.decode(s)\r\n  File \"/nix/store/8kzdflq0v06fq0mh9m2fd73gnyqp57xr-python3-3.7.3/lib/python3.7/json/decoder.py\", line 337, in decode\r\n    obj, end = self.raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())\r\n  File \"/nix/store/8kzdflq0v06fq0mh9m2fd73gnyqp57xr-python3-3.7.3/lib/python3.7/json/decoder.py\", line 355, in raw_decode\r\n    raise JSONDecodeError(\"Expecting value\", s, err.value) from None\r\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\r\n[2021-03-25 13:31:07,535] {connection.py:338} ERROR - Failed parsing the json for conn_id id\r\n'http://'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of now, this PR adds support for this case.  Though there is debate whether such values should be allowed in the `extra` field, or whether extra should always be key-value.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-30T20:26:38Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T05:05:26Z","closed_at":"2021-04-14T05:05:12Z","merged_at":"2021-04-14T05:05:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4c4e616e7684b708f6704a27ba9f7d2c9cb1022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/a
