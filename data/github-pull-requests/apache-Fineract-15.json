Warnings ⚠\n\nWarnings were logged while processing this repo. Please check the Dependency Dashboard for more information.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>mockito/mockito</summary>\n\n### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\n\n### Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions\n\nFor a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.\n\n#### Switch the default mockmaker to `mockito-inline`\n\nBack in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the \"inline bytecode\" principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates \"real\" subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.\n\nMassive thanks to community member [@&#8203;reta](https://togithub.com/reta) who implemented this change.\n\n##### When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?\n\nThere are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.\n\nIf you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new `mockito-subclass` artifact (published [on Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass) along with all our other artifacts).\n\n#### Update the minimum supported Java version to 11\n\nMockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes [issues with the `SecurityManager`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798).\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.\n\nMassive thanks to community member [@&#8203;reta](https://togithub.com/reta) who implemented this change.\n\n##### What should I do if I still run JDK 8?\n\nFor JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.\n\n#### New `type()` method on `ArgumentMatcher`\n\nOne of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the [`ArgumentMatcher` interface](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html).\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the `ArgumentMatcher` was the lack of varargs support.\nThere were many, many issues filed related to varargs and Mockito unable to handle them.\n\nCommunity member [@&#8203;big-andy-coates](https://togithub.com/big-andy-coates) put in a lot of effort to come up with an appropriate solution, including fully implementing and comparing 2 approaches.\nUltimately, we decided that introducing a new `type()` method on `ArgumentMatcher` is the best solution.\nAs a result, it is now possible to update your custom matchers to implement varargs support, if you so desire.\nNote that `ArgumentMatcher` is still a `@FunctionalInterface` and can therefore still be written as a lambda.\n\nMassive thanks to community member [@&#8203;big-andy-coates](https://togithub.com/big-andy-coates) who implemented this change.\n\n##### What is the effect of this new method?\n\nFor varargs methods, there was previously a way to only match zero arguments, or two or more arguments, by using the exact number of matchers, i.e.\n\n```java\nlong call(String... args);\n\n// Will match calls with exactly zero arguments:\nwhen(mock.call()).thenReturn(0L);\n\n// Will match calls with exactly two arguments:\nwhen(mock.call(any(), any())).thenReturn(0L);\n```\n\nBut following the pattern to match exactly one argument:\n\n```java\nwhen(mock.call(any())).thenReturn(0L);\n```\n\ndoesn't work, as `any` is \"vararg aware\", so Mockito matched the `any` against *each element* of the varargs parameter, meaning it will match any number of arguments, i.e. the above would of matched all of these:\n\n```java\nmock.call();\nmock.call(\"a\");\nmock.call(\"a\", \"b\");\n```\n\nWith the new `type` method, it's now possible to differentiate matching calls with any exact number of arguments, or to match any number of arguments.\n\n```java\n// Match any number of arguments:\nwhen(mock.call(any(String[].class))).thenReturn(1L);\n// Match invocations with no arguments:\nwhen(mock.call()).thenReturn(1L);\n// Match invocations with exactly one argument:\nwhen(mock.call(any())).thenReturn(1L);\n// Alternative to match invocations with exactly one argument:\nwhen(mock.call(any(String.class))).thenReturn(1L);\n// Match invocations with exactly two arguments:\nwhen(mock.call(any(), any())).thenReturn(1L);\n```\n\nTherefore, if you want to match 0 or more arguments, use `any(String[].class)`.\nIf you want to match an exact number of arguments, use `any(String.class)` (and specify as many `any` matchers as arguments you want to match on).\n\nIn a similar fashion, the behavior of `ArgumentCaptor.forClass` has changed as well.\nIf you want to capture all arguments, use an `ArgumentCaptor` for `String[]`, otherwise `String`:\n\n```java\n// Will capture 1 string\n@&#8203;Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String> captor;\n// Will capture all strings\n@&#8203;Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String[]> captor;\n```\n\nFor more information, see the description and conversation in [pull request 2835](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2835) and [pull request 2807](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2807).\n\n##### Do I need to implement this new method?\n\nNo, you don't need to.\nMockito 5 declares a default implementation, returning `Void.type` as the type of an `ArgumentMatcher`.\nThis essentially means that Mockito will not consider the type when handling varargs.\nHowever, if you do return a specific type, Mockito will consider this when matching arguments.\nAs a result, this new method is not a source-breaking change, but is a bytecode-breaking change.\nAll code working on Mockito 4 should work as-is when recompiled with Mockito 5.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 3am on Monday\" (UTC),
