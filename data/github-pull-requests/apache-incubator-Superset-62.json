SUMMARY\r\n\r\nReopen: #21141\r\n\r\nSince DatabaseSelector component has an unnecessary key, DatabaseSelector will be re-mounted  rather than update whenever currentDatabase object is updated. This causes the unexpected duplicate database list api request.\r\nThis commit removes this key so will skip unnecessary re-rendering and data fetching.\r\nIt also fixes the logic for currentDb that directly transform from db instead of useState. (This resolves the issue for #21174)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFeature flags are saved to a global window object and read using the `isFeatureEnabled` utility function, which returns `true` or `false` after checking the global window object.  As noted in #21201, this process is prone to error because feature flags are set at JS module execution time and sometimes also read at JS module execution time, creating a race condition that can be triggered by a change in webpack bundling.  This PR takes steps towards resolving one instance of this issue by moving the feature flag check to component render.  Previously, shared chart controls were exported as an object of control config objects, each of which contained the control's React component to render, params used by the control-rendering engine, and props that the control's React component would be rendered with.  For each shared control that had drag-and-drop functionality, a different config object would be exported at JS module execution time if `isFeatureEnabled` checks indicated that drag-and-drop functionality was enabled.  This PR moves the `isFeatureEnabled` check to inside a wrapper component, and uses a single config to render that wrapper component regardless of feature flag status.  While there was some overlap between config objects, the DnD and non-DnD versions of some control components required different props, so some refactoring was required to make it possible to merge the two config objects' props to form one unified config object.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Confirm that every chart type's control panel works as expected when the `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` feature flag is enabled and disabled.  When `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` is enabled, also ensure that everything works when `ENABLE_DND_WITH_CLICK_UX` is enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAllowing users to access each others profiles is not ideal and can give unwanted access to lightly sensitive (private) data, that option is not ideal to every company, but can be

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n_following feedback from #21280_ \r\n\r\nSince the #21280 can cover too much space by the left bar panel, this commit makes the sidebar width fixed and collapsed the overflowing items as well.\r\n\r\nAs #20778 introduces the resizable menu on dashboard, this commit refactors the resizable component shareable and then introduces the resizable feature to sqllab left bar so user can expend the width to check the full text on demand.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n-

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis was a bug that occurs because we have a default footer in our modal styles that let us connect when there is no database, which gave users a connection error. This hides the footer in the first stage of the DB modal, which is what it was according to its original design. \r\n\r\nI also added some height to the modal so that the first stage doesn't need a scroll, happy to revert that. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/187991815-7eb1333c-1cb5-4b59-b16b-2ee3438d667d.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently only truthy values are shown on the tooltip of the ECharts plugin, causing zeros to be removed.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes the bug and adds unit tests for both extracting the series and formatting (logic of both have been updated). In addition the tests are refactored to the preferred single test format (the refactoring changes can best be seen with \"Hide whitespace changes\").\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow zero is shown on the tooltip; see the series `SUM(0)`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/187962377-a6ce57ca-27f1-41b3-831f-1f378bf51e8b.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously only truthy values were shown, i.e. excluding zero:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/187962435-fc5fabf9-c6dc-4d4d-b7a6-24faf1f89a70.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `/tables/...` endpoint was augmented (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1466) when SQL Lab supported:\r\n\r\n1. Fetching tables/views across either a single or all schemas, i.e., the `SEE TABLE SCHEMA` functioned (if configured) without having a schema specified.\r\n2. Backend filtering.\r\n\r\nhowever the endpoint is now always called with a specified schema and filtering (substring table name matching) is never invoked.\r\n\r\nGiven these observations this PR refactors the endpoint‚Äîby removing unnecessary logic and providing a more performant ORM query given that all table/views are from a specific schema‚Äîand reduces the size of the response payload to improve performance (especially for schemas with a large number of tables/views).\r\n\r\nAdditionally as a byproduct of the refactor this PR removes:\r\n\r\n1.  The (now unused) `get_all_table_names_in_database` and `get_all_view_names_in_database` utility methods as well as the `get_all_datasource_names` DB engine spec method.\r\n2.  The (now unused) `dbs.allow_multi_schema_metadata_fetch` column\r\n3.  The non-functional `MAX_TABLE_NAMES` config key, i.e., the logic (which potentially was wrong) only capped the number of tables/views if and only if a filter was defined, however this was never invoked.\r\n4. The `superset update-datasources-cache` CLI command.\r\n5. Unnecessary keys in the response payload (to reduce the payload size).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis adds a script that generates a report of technical debt issues we care to track. These tech debt items are added as lint rules in a separate lint config for cleanliness. The script generates a JSON file with rollups/counts of each type of offense, as well as their granular files/lines. Over time, we can use these rollups/files to generate a report/dashboard and track our technical debt over time or enforce that it doesn't grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nWe'll keep this stuff on multiple GSheet tabs:\r\n\r\nTab 1: Aggregated stats for all validators (eslint, pylint, whatever...). This will have a schema with the following columns:\r\n* timestamp\r\n* rule (e.g. \"use typescript\")\r\n* description (rationale, e.g \"we moved to Typescript in SIP-X - don't add more javascript!)\r\n* count\r\n\r\nTab 2-n: Schema depends on the validator, but these will be \"shopping lists\" of tech debt\r\n* rule\r\n* other metadata columns... (depends on validator's needs)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n#21201 added a console error if feature flags are read before initialization, but the Jest test environment doesn't include a feature flag initialization step, so all tests that render components that check feature flags were printing lots of these console errors (though still passing).  This PR sets `featureFlags` to an empty object in the global window shim object used by Jest.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Run Jest tests and search the output for any console errors with \"feature flag\".  After this update, there should be none.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nSince `max_tables` logic multiplies (would have intended to `or`) max_items by the current size, it always returns entire list.\r\n(i.e. `config[\"MAX_TABLE_NAMES\"] = 1000` and `len(tables) = 40000` then `max_tables = 40000 * 1000 = 40,000,000`) \r\nThe previous logic also cuts out only if substr passed.\r\nThis commit always follows the `MAX_TABLE_NAMES` for both cases. (must set MAX_TABLE_NAMES to 0 if full table list needed)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nSet MAX_TABLE_NAMES to a small number\r\nGo to Sqllab and check the count of table list\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n#13218 introduced a hook for api resources. The main purpose of the hook is for a state management for async api request and transformed a return data to a desired format. As @ktmud suggested, react-query includes these specs and also provides the global cache storage. \r\n\r\nThis commit introduces `react-query` to design a new api resource for tables query first.\r\nWith the react-query hook, sqlLab can skip the duplicate request for table list on switching each tab. (And it can save the request table query in dataset configuration modal)\r\n\r\nAfter this commit merged, we can replace existing charts and database hooks by `react-query` too.\r\n\r\n###

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR hopes to help future developers more easily identify issues arising from feature flag race conditions.  Correct feature flag setting and reading on the frontend currently relies on JS module loading order and fails silently:\r\n- Status of feature flags is made available to front-end code via an object written to `window.featureFlags`.\r\n- This object is written when `preamble.js` (or other another module in some cases) is executed.\r\n- `window.featureFlags` is read by other modules at various points in the JS lifecycle, including module execution, React component mount, and React component update.  In at least one case, a bug has been traced back to FFs being read before this object has been written.\r\n- If `window.featureFlags` does not exist, the `isFeatureEnabled` function just returns `false`.\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps current behavior but prints a console error with a stack trace so developers can more easily link bugs with FF detection issues and update their code to check feature flags in a way that avoids this race condition.  **An ideal place to check for feature flag status is on React component mount, but making this change to all affected code is a larger process and will be tackled in a separate PR.**\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1075\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-08-25 at 2 17 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/186770591-5ab086a9-651f-411d-b778-afbef2ec9388.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nIn local dev environment, you can simulate feature flag detection before initialization by replacing `superset-frontend/src/preamble.ts:67` with `setTimeout(() => initFeatureFlags(bootstrapData?.common?.feature_flags));`.  Doing so should raise the console errors shown above.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe want add snowflake in superset, but our snowflake is using SSO authentication so we can't add it with built-in snowflake connector, we found we can connect it with snowflake keypair authentication. so I modified connector file to support keypair authentication. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nHow does Superset map from a SQLAlchemy URI ‚Äî eg, `postgres+psycopg2://user:password@host/db` ‚Äî to a DB engine spec? Currently **the mapping is done using only the backend** part of the URI; in this example `postgres` matches the `PostgresEngineSpec` engine spec since it's listed in the `engine_aliases` class attribute:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d408393ba9bb6c81c661248521be93dd70c9e19b/superset/db_engine_specs/postgres.py#L166-L168\r\n\r\nThis matching has worked perfectly until the introduction of new DB engine specs that share the backend but have different drivers. Eg, for Databricks we currently have 3 DB engine specs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d408393ba9bb6c81c661248521be93dd70c9e19b/superset/db_engine_specs/databricks.py#L49-L52\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d408393ba9bb6c81c661248521be93dd70c9e19b/superset/db_engine_specs/databricks.py#L58-L61\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d408393ba9bb6c81c661248521be93dd70c9e19b/superset/db_engine_specs/databricks.py#L76-L79\r\n\r\nWhenever we encounter a database configured with a `databricks` backend ‚Äî be it `databricks+pyhive://`, `databricks+pyodbc://` or `databricsk+connector://` we discard the driver part, and perform a match using only the backend. The end result is that **one of the 3 DB engine specs is chosen at random** every time!\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, I extended the base DB engine spec with 2 new class attributes:\r\n\r\n- `drivers: Dict[str, str] = {}`, a dictionary with driver names (\"psycopg2\") and their descriptions\r\n- `default_driver: Optional[str] = None`, the recommended driver to be used when one is not selected (used only when the SQLAlchemy URI is not entered directly)\r\n\r\nWith these new attributes, instead of simply matching the backend of a URI (`databricks`) we can use the driver as well (`pyhive`) to find the associated DB engine spec.\r\n\r\nA few things of note: first, if the backend matches but no driver matches the new flow will still return a random DB engine specs from the ones that support the backend. This preserves the old behavior and allows people to use drivers that Superset is not aware of. Eg, someone could configure a database with the `postgres+newfancydriver://` URI and Superset would still use `PostgresEngineSpec` as the engine spec.\r\n\r\nSecond, if no backend matches we also preserve the old behavior of returning the `BaseEngineSpec`, since this allows users to explore databases that Superset is not aware of, though at limited functionality (no time grains, for example).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
