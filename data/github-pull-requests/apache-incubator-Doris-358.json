Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSegment index file content is not set as 0 when it is constructed in write procedure, so when load index from this file, and meet a null VARCHAR cell, the null field of this cell is 0, but the length field which is not initialized maybe a large random number, then memory copy may cause overflow.\r\nThis patch fix this bug, and also skip useless memory copy to improve a bit of performance.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nBE can not graceful exit because some threads are running in endless\r\nloop. This patch do the following optimization:\r\n- Use the well encapsulated Thread and ThreadPool instead of std::thread\r\n  and std::vector<std::thread>\r\n- Use CountDownLatch in thread's loop condition to avoid endless loop\r\n- Introduce a new class Daemon for daemon works, like tcmalloc_gc,\r\n  memory_maintenance and calculate_metrics\r\n- Decouple statistics type TaskWorkerPool and StorageEngine notification\r\n  by submit tasks to TaskWorkerPool's queue\r\n- Reorder objects' stop and deconstruct in main(), i.e. stop network\r\n  services at first, then internal services\r\n- Use libevent in pthreads mode, by calling evthread_use_pthreads(),\r\n  then EvHttpServer can exit gracefully in multi-threads\r\n- Call brpc::Server's Stop() and ClearServices() explicitly\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSometimes we want to detect the hotspot of a cluster, for example, hot scanned tablet, hot wrote tablet, but we have no insight about tablets in the cluster.\r\nThis patch introduce tablet level metrics to help to achieve this object, now support 4 metrics on tablets: `query_scan_bytes `, `query_scan_rows `, `flush_bytes `, `flush_count `. However, one BE may holds hundreds of thousands of tablets, so I add a parameter for the metrics HTTP request, and not return tablet level metrics by default.\r\nref https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/3517 https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/4027\r\n\r\nIn order to support re-register a same MetricEnity to MetricRegistry, and re-register a same Metric to MetricEntity I also redesign the metric structure.\r\nref https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/4396\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn the current code, if we do not specify replication_num when creating OlapTable, the default value of 3 will be used, but for some test environments and small clusters, the number of backends is likely to be less than 3, which will cause confusion for users\r\nTherefore, when the number of backends is less than 3 When the default replication_num should be equal to the number of backends, the default value should be 3 when the number of backends is greater than 3.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSince the Segment V2 has been released for a long time, we should make it as default storage format for newly created table.\r\n\r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n1. For all newly created tables, their default storage format is Segment V2.\r\n2. For all already exist tablets, their storage format remain unchanged.\r\n3. Fix  bugs described in Fix #4384 and Fix #4385\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4386), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nWe should provide a more friendly way to check the conversion progress of Segment

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe rewrite rule named `CountToSum` does not distinguish between `Count` and `Count distinct` which causes `Count distinct` is rewritten as `Sum` incorrectly.\r\nSo this commit

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen creating a tablet, it is necessary to select a disk from all disks that meet the requirements on the BE node to store the tablet. In doris, the current disk selection strategy is to randomly select a disk from all disks that meet the requirements for tablet creation. After the cluster has been running for a long time, we found that the distribution of the number of tablets on different disks in a BE node is unbalanced. In order to solve this problem, we introduced the algorithm of \"two random choices\" for disk selection when creating the tablet:\r\n(1) Select two disks from all disks that meet the requirements on the BE node randomly；\r\n(2) Choose the disk with a smaller number of tablet from the two disks selected in (1) for tablet creation.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Disable the MySQL client and LZO library by default when building the Doris.\r\n\r\n    MySQL client library is used for MySQL external table feature.\r\n    This feature will be replaced by the new ODBC external table soon.\r\n\r\n    LZO library is used to compress/decompress data of some old data format of Doris,\r\n    which is no longer used anymore.\r\n\r\n2. Add missing license to some files.\r\n\r\n3. For all non-Apache-License code, all are explained in NOTICE file and the corresponding license is declared.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the js source code from webroot, it will be downloaded as thirdparty\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] License\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [] I have create an issue on (Fix #ISSUE), and

Support convert(expr, target_type) function, which is same as CastExpr\r\n2.

Add more columns for table `information_schema.columns`\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSometimes we want to detect the hotspot of a cluster, for example, hot scanned tablet, hot wrote tablet, but we have no insight about tablets in the cluster.\r\nThis patch introduce tablet level metrics to help to achieve this object, now support 4 metrics on tablets: `query_scan_bytes `, `query_scan_rows `, `flush_bytes `, `flush_count `. However, one BE may holds hundreds of thousands of tablets, so I add a parameter for the metrics HTTP request, and not return tablet level metrics by default.\r\n\r\nref https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/3517 https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/issues/4027\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen setting global variables, such as `set global default_rowset_type=beta`,\r\nthe operation is not correctly persisted.\r\n\r\nThis CL change the fe meta version to 90.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this problem is that for the modification of global variable,\r\nwe directly use Java's reflection mechanism to modify static member variables in `GlobalVariable` class.\r\n\r\nBut in the persistence method of the `set` operation, we only persist the value stored\r\nin the `globalSessionVariable` variable, and this variable does not contain Global Variable.\r\n\r\nSo I added a new OperationType: `OP_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_V2`,\r\nand added a `GlobalVarPersistInfo` class to record all changes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4323), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests
