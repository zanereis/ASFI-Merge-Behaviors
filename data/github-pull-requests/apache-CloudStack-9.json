Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8662\r\nThe issue got introduced in 4.19. When we try to login, we check login credentials using different types of authenticators. While verifying in case of wrong password with `oauth2` authenticator and there are no providers setup for it, it throws a CloudRuntime Exception. Because the error isn't caught, we respond with 200 status code but with empty response. This results in UI getting stuck. This PR fixes this by skipping the authentication check if the secret code is null.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\nWhile logging in, if the user doesn't exist it fails with a valid error\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/8760112/35ffd5e2-f5e2-44d3-91f5-c209b44f9a89)\r\n\r\nIf the user exists, but the password is wrong then loading starts on top and the UI gets stuck. I had to clean up my local storage to make the browser work again.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/8760112/b542af8f-7e2e-4d86-ab88-3ae9a400adac)\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce, use username as \"admin\" or any other user which exists.

Description\r\n\r\nEach hypervisor can support a different number of network adapters. Comparing KVM and VMWare, VMWare defines a limited number of NICs for each ESXi machine (https://configmax.esp.vmware.com/guest?vmwareproduct=vSphere&release=vSphere%207.0&categories=1-0), while the number of tiers that can be allocated using KVM depends on the number of PCI slots availabe. For example, KVM provides 32 PCI slots, which are used to connect several devices, e.g. CD-ROM, keyboard, etc. Every ACS VR already consumes 9 slots of the 32 available; thus, in KVM we can have 23 slots for new tiers to be added.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the `vpc.max.networks` setting to `ConfigKey` and changes its scope to the cluster level, as the maximum number of networks per VPC depends on the hypervisor where the VR is deployed.\r\n\r\nThe setting value is defined based on the cluster in which the VPC's VR is running, using the lowest value found if the VPC has more than one VR and they are in different clusters.

Description\r\n\r\nWhile listing volumes from a primary storage, volumes from system VMs are not listed, making the primary storage removal process difficult as an exception is thrown if the storage still has active volumes when trying to be deleted.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, logs have been added to the primary storage removal process, informing which undestroyed volumes are associated with the primary storage and which instance they are allocated to if an exception is thrown during the process.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix

Description\r\n\r\nWhen calling the `listRoles` API, users can see roles with more permissions than theirs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the behavior of the `listRoles` API was changed so that users can only see roles that their role has permission to access (roles with same and less permissions).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n####

(if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I created a custom role based on User role and added the `listRoles` API to it.\r\n2. I created an account using the role from step 1 and logged into it.\r\n3. I called the `listRoles` API via CloudMonkey and verfied that the roles with more permissions than mine were not listed, such as default admin

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a scenario where if the first cluster verified by ACS does not have any compatible hosts, an exception is thrown, ignoring the verification of possible compatible hosts in other clusters.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- Cluster 1: Host A\r\n- Cluster 2: Host B\r\n\r\nUsing the environment above, I added the flexible host tag `false` to Host A, and tried to deploy a VM; which would always result on an incompatible host for Cluster 1. Prior to this patch, the `CloudRuntimeException` is thrown with the message `No suitable host found for vm [...].` and Host B is not verified.\r\n\r\nAfter applying this patch, the message `No suitable host found for VM [%s] in %s.` is still logged, however, Host B is verified for compatibility and the VM is deployed as expected.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, almost every command MS sends to the agents uses the global setting `wait` as the timeout's value. That means, if you want to extend or shorten the execution of a command, you will affect every other command. Therefore, currently we **do not** have a way to customize the timeout for specific commands.\r\n\r\nFor some edge cases, we have \"wait\"/\"timeout\" hardcoded values or values that come from global settings to set the commands timeout, like for `GetAutoScaleMetricsCommand` and for `MigrateCommand`. Currently, we have 385 classes that extend `com.cloud.agent.api.Command` (I skipped classes that extend `com.cloud.agent.api.Answer`); therefore, externalizing global settings for each command  to provide flexibility is not feasible; however, we can reach flexibility by other means. \r\n\r\nCurrently, if we do not set a `wait` to the command, `AgentManagerImpl` will fallback to the `wait` global setting:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/af8a582055c4194d1e42c8c1abd96969692046ed/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/agent/manager/AgentManagerImpl.java#L441-L443\r\n \r\nI propose to create a table of `command_timeout` to store the classpath of the command and its wait/timeout. Then, instead of fall backing directly to the `wait` global setting, we check if there is an entry of the command in this table. If it exists, then we use the entry's value; otherwise, we fall back to the `wait` global setting (the current behavior). Thus, we can change the commands wait/timeout on demand and in a flexible way.\r\n\r\nThe first step of the proposal is to create the table and changing `AgentManagerImpl` to check the table. Some entries will already be created for hardcoded values. Further steps can be found in #8506.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking

Description\r\n\r\nWhen validating the `endpoint.url` global setting, such as when using the `createKubernetesCluster` API, we encounter the exception message `Global setting endpoint.url has to be set to the Management Server's API endpoint`. This message lacks clarity about the problem to be solved and exposes information about the environment. Upon further analysis, it was found that this same message was used across several classes, repeating the same code in each one of them.\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses this issue by replacing the exception with a generic one that does not expose any information about the environment. Also, it introduces a more detailed and explicit message to the logs, including the current value of `endpoint.url`. Furthermore, a new method has been implemented to validate the `endpoint.url` whenever necessary.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested by using CloudMonkey and tried to create a Kubernetes cluster.

Description\r\n\r\nThe PR #7152 changed the unit of the Quota types `VM_DISK_IO_READ`, `VM_DISK_IO_WRITE`, `VM_DISK_BYTES_READ` and `VM_DISK_BYTES_WRITE`. However, the pre-populated tariffs were not considered, and their unit type is still with the old value. The unit was only displayed incorrectly, as the calculation utilizes the correct unit. Their unit types were updated to the correct ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Update script</summary>\r\n\r\n```log\r\n2024-02-05 14:42:03,890 INFO  [c.c.u.DatabaseUpgradeChecker] (main:null) (logid:) DB version = 4.19.0.0 Code Version = 4.19.1.0\r\n2024-02-05 14:42:03,894 INFO  [c.c.u.DatabaseUpgradeChecker] (main:null) (logid:) Database upgrade must be performed from 4.19.0.0 to 4.19.1.0\r\n2024-02-05 14:42:03,949 DEBUG [c.c.u.DatabaseUpgradeChecker] (main:null) (logid:) Running upgrade Upgrade41900to41910 to upgrade from 4.19.0.0-4.19.1.0 to 4.19.1.0\r\n2024-02-05 14:42:03,957 DEBUG [c.c.u.d.ScriptRunner] (main:null) (logid:) -- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n2024-02-05 14:42:03,958 DEBUG [c.c.u.d.ScriptRunner] (main:null) (logid:) -- or more contributor license agreements.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the overall Quota balance calculation by breaking into separate methods and calculating based on the period dates rather than the Quota usage records for a better understanding of its flow. This PR also introduces smoke test for Quota balance and normalized the aggregation usage calculation when it is not daily or hourly.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. Create a quota tariff with the usage type `6` (i.e. volume).\r\n2. Created an account.\r\n3. Added credits to the account.\r\n4. Created a volume assigned to the newly created account.\r\n5. Verified that the account balance was consistent with the tariff value.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nid   |account_id|domain_id|credit_balance|credits_id|updated_on         |\r\n-----+----------+---------+--------------+----------+-------------------+\r\n12876|        47|        1|  100.00000000|        26|2024-01-31 16:40:11|\r\n12879|        47|        1|    0.00000000|         0|2024-01-31 16:39:00|\r\n12880|        47|        1|   92.85277786|         0|2024-01-31 16:40:59|\r\n12883|        47|        1|   82.51944399|         0|2024-01-31 16:42:59|\r\n12886|        47|        1|   72.18611012|         0|2024-01-31 16:44:59|\r\n12889|        47|        1|   61.85277625|         0|2024-01-31 16:46:59|\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nI also tried to invert the steps in the test above\r\n\r\n1. Create a quota tariff with the usage type `6` (i.e. volume).\r\n2. Created an account.\r\n3. Created a volume assigned to the newly created account.\r\n4. Added credits to the account.\r\n5.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new API \"checkVolume\" that allows users or admins to check and repair if any leaks observed. Currently this is supported only for KVM\r\n\r\nDoc PR link : https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/380\r\n\r\nThere are few cases when VMs shutdown uncleanly, particularly those using qcow2, they can leak clusters. This may sometimes lead to volumes taking up much more space than they are supposed to. When we use qcow2 format to thin provision, and the volume size is pretty close to the actual formatted size, leaked clusters can run us out of space, so we need a way to check/repair.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we have introduced a new API \"checkVolume\" API which takes parameters volume id and repair (possible values are leaks/all)\r\n\r\nAPI name: checkVolume\r\nParameters:\r\n- id : volume ID\r\n- repair : parameter to repair the volume, leaks or all are the possible values\r\n\r\nThere is also option to repair the volume during VM start or while attaching the volume to VM. Introduced a new boolean global setting\r\nvolume.check.and.repair.leaks.before.use  with a default false.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Create a VM on local storage, or NFS storage.\r\n2. attach a data disk\r\n3. run a write benchmark on data disk in guest. e.g.:\r\n`    fio --filename=/dev/vdb --direct=1 --rw=randwrite --bsrange=512-4k --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=32 --runtime=120 --numjobs=8 --time_based --group_reporting --name=iops-test-job --norandommap`\r\n\r\n4. immediately kill the VM (from host try virsh shutdown or \"kill -9\" of qemu process\r\n5. run a check on the underlying qcow2 file, observe \"leaks\" count\r\n```\r\n# qemu-img check /var/lib/libvirt/images/26be20c7-b9d0-43f6-a76e-16c70737a0e0

qemu-img check /var/lib/libvirt/images/26be20c7-b9d0-43f6-a76e-16c70737a0e0 --output=json -r leaks 2>/dev/null\r\n{\r\n    \"image-end-offset\": 6442582016,\r\n    \"total-clusters\": 163840,\r\n

This breaks the API as the web routes are not defined.\r\n\r\nFixes #8558\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [x] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nRebuilt the RPM packages under Rocky Linux 8 / CentOS 8 using Docker.\r\n\r\nNew cloudstack-ui packages now have the proper permissions:\r\n```\r\n# rpm2cpio  ../cloudstack-ui-4.18.2.0-SNAPSHOT.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idm                           \r\n54793 blocks         \r\n                                                                                       \r\n# cd usr/share/cloudstack-ui/                                                                   \r\n\r\n# ls -al\r\ntotal 524                                                                                                   \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root    181 Jan 25 18:00 .                                                                \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root     38 Jan 25 18:00 ..                                                               \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    175 Jan 25 18:00 assets                                                           \r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14318 Jan 25 17:57 cloud.ico                                                        \r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 456667 Jan 25 17:57 color.less                                                       \r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     30 Jan 25 17:57 config.json -> /etc/cloudstack/ui/config.json                    \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   8192 Jan 25 18:00 css                                                              \r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1228 Jan 25 17:57 error.html                                                       \r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1220 Jan 25 17:57 example.html                                                     \r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  18123 Jan 25 17:57 index.html                                                       \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  16384 Jan 25 18:00 js                                                               \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    309 Jan 25 18:00 locales                                                          \r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root     21 Jan 25 18:00 WEB-INF                                                          \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\nAffects only rpmbuild for the cloudstack-ui package.

algorithm `firstfitleastconsumed` orders the secondary storages based on how much free capacity each has and returns the first item of the list that has enough free capacity. However, the ordering of this list is inverted, putting the storages with the least free capacity at the top.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has been adjusted, altering the order of the list to guarantee that the secondary storages with the most free capacity get allocated first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

templates, allowing operators to delete such templates.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes bug introduced in #8502. Timeout for script execution was set to 60 ms instead of 60s which resulted in host not getting UEFI enabled. This is a blocker for 4.19 release.\r\n\r\nWe do this by introducing a new agent parameter `agent.script.timeout` (default - 60 seconds) to use as a timeout for the script checking host's UEFI status.\r\n\r\nWe also externalize the timeout for the ReadyCommand by introducing a new global setting `ready.command.wait` (default - 60 seconds).\r\n\r\nFor ModifyStoragePoolCommand, we don't externalize the timeout to avoid confusion for the user. Since, the required timeout can vary depending on the provider in use and we are only setting the wait for default host listener for now. Instead, we reuse the global `wait` setting by dividing it by `5` making the default value of 6 minutes (1800/5 = 360s) for ModifyStoragePoolCommand.\r\n\r\nNote: the actual time, the MS waits is twice the wait set for a Command. Check reference code below.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/19250403e645c76f60b17aa4aeb4dc915f5ca206/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/agent/manager/AgentAttache.java#L406-L442\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nWe discovered this issue in one of our envs where a VM was running on the host but the state of the VM in the host was Stopped. Ideally power reports should have fixed this, but it didn't.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses below, to ensure power state in sync with the instance state.\r\n- allows the VM state update through power state report handler when there is a mismatch in power state - PowerOn, PowerOff and instance state - Stopped, Running respectively, that is when\r\n  * VM is in stopped state and power report is powerOn\r\n  * VM is in running state and power report is powerOff\r\n   It sends an update (publishes a message on Topic `VM_POWER_STATE`). The subscriber on this topic transits the VM as per the state & powerstate.\r\n- resets the power state update counter before VM migration, which allows power state report handler to update with proper state / host.\r\n- updates power state to 'PowerOff' when VM is stopped.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce the issue. But updating the entry for vm_instance in the database helps.\r\n1. Launch a VM and ensure it's running.\r\n2. Run the below update query for the instance\r\n```sql\r\nUPDATE vm_instance SET state = 'Stopped', power_state_update_count = 3 where id = 12345;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should switch back to 'Running' after next power state update, but it doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the StoragePoolType from an Enum to a class that is largely compatible with Enum. This allows for storage pool plugins to be added dynamically without needing to hard code an enum value into the core code. We are trying to be Enum compatible to avoid having to refactor much of the code where these are used.\r\n\r\nTo do this, on the KVM agent side we needed to move from annotation based StoragePoolTypes on the StorageAdaptors to having an adaptor method report the StoragePoolType. This was because annotations aren't dynamic enough to be able to use StoragePoolTypes that aren't static.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

Description\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/374\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses two issues:\r\n1. Allow DRS to work as expected in clusters with hosts of different capacities - We do this by using ratio of free/total metric. This is controlled using a new setting `drs.metric.use.ratio`.\r\n2. Imbalance can be greater than 1. For condensed algorithm, migrations don't take place when this happens. - This happens when the distribution of metrics is skewed. We fix this by filtering out values where ratio is less than `drs.imbalance.condensed.skip.threshold` if `drs.metric.type` is `free` and greater than `drs.imbalance.condensed.skip.threshold` if `drs.metric.type` is `used` to remove the skew and check if we need drs or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default value for the `vm_memballoon_stats_period` configuration is set to `0`. As a result, out of the box in ACS, memory metrics for Windows instances (with virtio drivers correctly installed and configured) is compromised when using KVM hypervisor. This pull request aims to propose setting the `vm_memballoon_stats_period` configuration value to `60`. This correction addresses situations such as the one reported through the issue: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8453.\r\n\r\nfixes: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8453\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n-  Before changes:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/19981369/3ad3cac5-3890-4057-9d1c-171435c45af6)\r\n\r\n- After changes:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/19981369/0a074d4b-636d-4b39-9a20-6f157ee0a46c)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nA Windows VM was created, and it was confirmed that the VirtIO drivers were correctly installed. However, upon inspecting the metrics collected by ACS, it was observed that they did not align with the actual consumption of the VM.

Description\r\n\r\nThe class `LibvirtComputingResource` does not provide enough information about what is happening during the metrics collection process and contains some logs with formatting issues. \r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the metrics collection process while adding logs, and fixes some logs that contained problems.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI manually verified the logs in the agent. Regarding the refactoring, I adapted the unit tests to a commit before the refactoring and verified that the metrics had the same values before and after the changes.","created_at":"2024-01-15T17:41:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T13:49:34Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T13:49:22Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T13:49:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"b11897cdfa88eb84254eee1bb20d5f0d0199c067","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":821716113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjE3MTYxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:cleanup","name":"type:cleanup","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1082374171,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDgyMzc0MTcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:logging","name":"component:logging","color":"eaa498","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30/labels","id":9577330,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AkiNy","number":30,"title":"4.20.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":245,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-06-23T18:43:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T09:42:31Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-11-27T14:52:35Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/8511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/8511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/8511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/28e36d690cc6b242201feb2a9dcf5f204600af3a","head":{"label":"scclouds:refactor-libvirtcomputingresource-metrics","ref":"refactor-libvirtcomputingresource-metrics","sha":"28e36d690cc6b242201feb2a9dcf5f204600af3a","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/

Description\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of test failures due to `test_vm_life_cycle.py` in multiple PRs due to host not available for migration of VMs.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8438#issuecomment-1886990285\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8433#issuecomment-1878406524\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7344#issuecomment-1886811369\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile debugging I noticed that the hosts get stuck in `Connecting` state because MS is waiting for a response of the `ReadyCommand` from the agent. Since we take a lock on connection and disconnection, restarting the agent doesn't work. To fix this, we have to restart the MS or wait for ~1 hour (default timeout).\r\n\r\nOn the agent side, it gets stuck waiting for a response from the Script execution.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, run `smoke/test_vm_life_cycle.py` (`TestSecuredVmMigration` test class to be specific). Once the tests are complete, you will notice that some hosts are stuck in `Connecting` state. And restarting the agent fails due to the named lock. Locks on DB can be checked using the below query.\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM performance_schema.metadata_locks\r\nINNER JOIN performance_schema.threads ON THREAD_ID = OWNER_THREAD_ID\r\nWHERE PROCESSLIST_ID <> CONNECTION_ID() \\G;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a wait for the ready command and a timeout to the Script execution to ensure that the thread doesn't get stuck and the named lock from database is released.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nRan `smoke/test_vm_life_cycle.py` multiple times.

Description\r\n\r\nThe description of the API `moveUser` parameters does not match its functionalities. Furthermore, the description of the API itself does not clearly state the limitation of only moving users between accounts within the same domain.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by changing those descriptions to align with the API functionality.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n-  Before changes:\r\n![old-moveuser](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/4229c954-5fc4-4b81-964c-aa067acf2761)\r\n\r\n- After changes:\r\n![new-moveuser](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/3c7568c7-e59c-4448-b684-cb6a7ca18cc0)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested by using CloudMonkey to list the command's description and its parameters.","created_at":"2024-01-11T18:29:41Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T10:13:51Z","closed_at":"2024-02-05T08:48:03Z","merged_at":"2024-02-05T08:48:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f299492f6565b4c00ce2977977b15f30e1a3725","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31/labels","id":9981290,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AmE1q","number":31,"title":"4.19.1.0","description":"issues
