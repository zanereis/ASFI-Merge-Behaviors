What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRefactor RRDD by separating the common logic interacting with the R worker to a new class RRunner, which can be used to evaluate R UDFs.\n\nNow RRDD relies on RRuner for RDD computation and RRDD could be reomved if we want to remove RDD API in SparkR later.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\ndev/lint-r\nSparkR unit tests\n","created_at":"2016-03-29T02:35:02Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T04:52:54Z","closed_at":"2016-03-29T04:52:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33d8335bb4c7fe3784857e5c2624c84a2651b578","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1eda42c4e54208d71838dde55adee4ce888bba90","head":{"label":"sun-rui:SPARK-12792_new","ref":"SPARK-12792_new","sha":"1eda42c4e54208d71838dde55adee4ce888bba90","user":{"login":"sun-rui","id":2528327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjgzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2528327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui","html_url":"https://github.com/sun-rui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34327558,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMyNzU1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sun-rui/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sun-rui","id":2528327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjgzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2528327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui","html_url":"https://github.com/sun-rui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sun-rui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sun-rui/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nData is displayed in the schema order of the encoder, but the column names are displayed in the order of the underlying data frame schema, this results in mismatch of column names and the data in the output. This PR modifies the schema used in the showString() method to the encoder schema. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new unit test case to check the output of showString when the schema orders are different.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, this causes batches where some values are dictionary encoded and some\nwhich are not. The non-dictionary encoded values cause us to remove the dictionary\nfrom the batch causing the first values to return garbage.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by first decoding the dictionary for the values that are\nalready dictionary encoded before switching.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR brings the support for chained Python UDFs, for example\n\n``` sql\nselect udf1(udf2(a))\nselect udf1(udf2(a) + 3)\nselect udf1(udf2(a) + udf3(b)) \n```\n\nAlso directly chained unary Python UDFs are put in single batch of Python UDFs, others may require multiple batches.\n\nFor example,\n\n``` python\n>>> sqlContext.sql(\"select double(double(1))\").explain()\n== Physical Plan ==\nWholeStageCodegen\n:  +- Project [pythonUDF#10 AS double(double(1))#9]\n:     +- INPUT\n+- !BatchPythonEvaluation double(double(1)), [pythonUDF#10]\n   +- Scan OneRowRelation[]\n>>> sqlContext.sql(\"select double(double(1) + double(2))\").explain()\n== Physical Plan ==\nWholeStageCodegen\n:  +- Project [pythonUDF#19 AS double((double(1) + double(2)))#16]\n:     +- INPUT\n+- !BatchPythonEvaluation double((pythonUDF#17 + pythonUDF#18)), [pythonUDF#17,pythonUDF#18,pythonUDF#19]\n   +- !BatchPythonEvaluation double(2), [pythonUDF#17,pythonUDF#18]\n      +- !BatchPythonEvaluation double(1), [pythonUDF#17]\n         +- Scan OneRowRelation[]\n```\n\nTODO: will support multiple unrelated Python UDFs in one batch (another PR).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests for chained

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds all the current Spark SQL DDL commands to the new ANTLR 4 based SQL parser.\n\nI have found a few inconsistencies in the current commands:\n- Function has an alias field. This is actually the class name of the function.\n- Partition specifications should contain nulls in some commands, and contain `None`s in others.\n- `AlterTableSkewedLocation`: Should defines which columns have skewed values, and should allow us to define storage for each skewed combination of values. We currently only allow one value per field.\n- `AlterTableSetFileFormat`: Should only have one file format, it currently supports both.\n\nI have implemented all these comments like they were, and I propose to improve them in follow-up PRs.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing DDLCommandSuite.\n\ncc @rxin @andrewor14 @yhuai

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to implement the following four Database-related DDL commands:\n- `CREATE DATABASE|SCHEMA [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name`\n- `DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] database_name [RESTRICT|CASCADE]`\n- `DESCRIBE DATABASE [EXTENDED] db_name`\n- `ALTER (DATABASE|SCHEMA) database_name SET DBPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)`\n\nAnother PR will be submitted to handle the unsupported commands. In the Database-related DDL commands, we will issue an error exception for `ALTER (DATABASE|SCHEMA) database_name SET OWNER [USER|ROLE] user_or_role`.\n\ncc @yhuai @andrewor14 @rxin Could you review the changes? Is it in the right direction? Thanks!\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a few test cases in `command/DDLSuite.scala` for testing DDL command execution in `SQLContext`. Since `HiveContext` also shares the same implementation, the existing test cases in `\\hive` also verifies the correctness of these

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the function `window` as a column expression.\n\n`window` can be used to bucket rows into time windows given a time column. With this expression, performing time series analysis on batch data, as well as streaming data should become much more simpler.\n### Usage\n\nAssume the following schema:\n\n`sensor_id, measurement, timestamp`\n\nTo average 5 minute data every 1 minute (window length of 5 minutes, slide duration of 1 minute), we will use:\n\n``` scala\ndf.groupBy(window(\"timestamp\", “5 minutes”, “1 minute”), \"sensor_id\")\n  .agg(mean(\"measurement\").as(\"avg_meas\"))\n```\n\nThis will generate windows such as:\n\n```\n09:00:00-09:05:00\n09:01:00-09:06:00\n09:02:00-09:07:00 ...\n```\n\nIntervals will start at every `slideDuration` starting at the unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).\nTo start intervals at a different point of time, e.g. 30 seconds after a minute, the `startTime` parameter can be used.\n\n``` scala\ndf.groupBy(window(\"timestamp\", “5 minutes”, “1 minute”, \"30 second\"), \"sensor_id\")\n  .agg(mean(\"measurement\").as(\"avg_meas\"))\n```\n\nThis will generate windows such as:\n\n```\n09:00:30-09:05:30\n09:01:30-09:06:30\n09:02:30-09:07:30 ...\n```\n\nSupport for Python will be made in a follow up PR after this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch has some basic unit tests for the `TimeWindow` expression testing that the parameters pass validation, and it also has some unit/integration tests testing the correctness of the windowing and usability in complex operations (multi-column grouping, multi-column projections, joins).\n","created_at":"2016-03-28T19:06:55Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:59:19Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T20:21:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9946e5a8cc03a7dad7ce611f9df547a94f6081d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff27b7aef7478ef17c1cede901688deb78d26a4c","head":{"label":"brkyvz:df-time-window","ref":"df-time-window","sha":"ff27b7aef7478ef17c1cede901688deb78d26a4c","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new `cloud` module and maven profile to pull in object store support from `hadoop-openstack`, `hadoop-aws` and `hadoop-azure` JARs, along with their dependencies. \r\n\r\nAs a result, it restores `s3n://` access to S3, adds its `s3a://` replacement , OpenStack `swift://` and azure `wasb://`.\r\n\r\nThe patch defines a new module, `spark-cloud` with transitive dependencies on the amazon and azure JARs. The spark assembly module JAR depends on this module to pull the relevant hadoop and dependent JARs into `SPARK_HOME/jars`. This module is only included in a build if the -`cloud` profile is set; there's an implicit dependency on the `hadoop-2.7` module too, because that is where the various hadoop-$CLOUD modules are imported.\r\n\r\nThere's a documentation page, `cloud_integration.md`, which covers the details of using Spark with object stores: API level, the different object stores, limitations, recommended tuning options. All the examples are in Scala. The docs try to be an introduction which avoids cut-and-paste text which will age fast against different versions, pointing at the Hadoop docs.\r\n\r\nHaving an explicit module enables downstream applications to declare their dependency upon `spark-cloud` and get object store access. This is used for the integration tests, which therefore implicitly test the correctness of the declared dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere is no import or coverage of the google cloud storage gs:// storage; that's not an ASF project & we've actually had some problems with gs; at the time of writing it hasn't implemented the standard Hadoop FS contract tests, so it's not clear what state is in. That could be future work.\r\n\r\nThere is a mention but no details on Amazon EMR's S3:// client. It's essentially says \"Amazon's code, their problem\", which is the case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere are no functional tests in this module; it is left to downstream projects to implement integration tests. I have such tests in [https://github.com/steveloughran/spark-cloud-examples/tree/master/cloud-examples](https://github.com/steveloughran/spark-cloud-examples/tree/master/cloud-examples)\r\n\r\nThe module has been tested against: Hadoop 2.7.3, branch-2.8 (2.8.0-SNAPSHOT), branch-2 (2.9.0-SNAPSHOT) and Hadoop trunk; \r\n\r\nTested endpoints: AWS S3 US-East, AWS S3 Ireland, Azure (US and EU), and Rackspace Swift US and EU,\r\n","created_at":"2016-03-28T17:57:00Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T15:27:03Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T17:18:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bcf1374fb13037c79c8b3b7d948fd63ac365b904","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/83d936870ad0651fc2622593e53d3e31d7eb8d4b","head":{"label":"steveloughran:features/SPARK-7481-cloud","ref":"features/SPARK-7481-cloud","sha":"83d936870ad0651fc2622593e53d3e31d7eb8d4b","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMajor changes:\n1. Implement `FileFormat.buildReader()` for the CSV data source.\n2. Add an extra argument to `FileFormat.buildReader()`, `physicalSchema`, which is basically the result of `FileFormat.inferSchema` or user specified schema.\n   \n   This argument is necessary because the CSV data source needs to know all the columns of the underlying files to read the file.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should do the work.\n","created_at":"2016-03-28T16:44:57Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T01:22:49Z","closed_at":"2016-03-31T01:22:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2462ec096cdb0a50781f409a9934516118adf651","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12002/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12002/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12002/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c48f7b2274039400928aa74e02b0db70380df7d","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14206-csv-build-reader","ref":"spark-14206-csv-build-reader","sha":"1c48f7b2274039400928aa74e02b0db70380df7d","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

pull request fixes an issue in which cluster-mode executors fail to properly register a JDBC driver when the driver is provided in a jar by the user, but the driver class name is derived from a JDBC URL (rather than specified by the user).  The consequence of this is that all JDBC accesses under the described circumstances fail with an `IllegalStateException`. I reported the issue here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14204\n\nMy proposed solution is to have the executors register the JDBC driver class under all circumstances, not only when the driver is specified by the user.\n\nThis patch was tested manually.  I built an assembly jar, deployed it to a cluster, and confirmed that the problem was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pr is to skip unnecessary sorts if input data have been already ordered in InMemoryRelation.\nLet's say we have a cached table with column 'a' sorted;\n\n```\nval df1 = Seq((1, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\nval df2 = df1.sort(\"a\").cache\ndf2.show // just cache data\n```\n\nIf you say `df2.sort(\"a\")`, the current spark generates a plan like;\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\nSort [a#13 ASC], true, 0\n+- InMemoryColumnarTableScan [a#13,b#14], InMemoryRelation [a#13,b#14], true, 10000, StorageLevel(true, true, false, true, 1), Sort [a#13 ASC], true, 0, None\n```\n\nThis pr removes this unnecessary sort.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd tests to check this kind of sort operators is removed in an optimizer.\n","created_at":"2016-03-28T10:29:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T11:43:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T06:45:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"543cfa76a6a7d34d0697c63db5d8541e8753be12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18a2e936ffe82925d9af0803057c35641198f3ea","head":{"label":"maropu:SortAttr","ref":"SortAttr","sha":"18a2e936ffe82925d9af0803057c35641198f3ea","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14191\n\n`Expand` operator now uses its child plan's constraints as its valid constraints (i.e., the base of constraints). This is not correct because `Expand` will set its group by attributes to null values. So the nullability of these attributes should be true.\n\nE.g., for an `Expand` operator like:\n\n```\nval input = LocalRelation('a.int, 'b.int, 'c.int).where('c.attr > 10 && 'a.attr < 5 && 'b.attr > 2)\nExpand(\n  Seq(\n    Seq('c, Literal.create(null, StringType), 1),\n    Seq('c, 'a, 2)),\n  Seq('c, 'a, 'gid.int),\n  Project(Seq('a, 'c), input))\n```\n\nThe `Project` operator has the constraints `IsNotNull('a)`, `IsNotNull('b)` and `IsNotNull('c)`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14189\n\nWhen inferred types in the same field during finding compatible `DataType`, are `IntegralType` and `DecimalType` but `DecimalType` is not capable of the given `IntegralType`, JSON data source simply fails to find a compatible type resulting in `StringType`.\n\nThis can be observed when `prefersDecimal` is enabled.\n\n``` scala\ndef mixedIntegerAndDoubleRecords: RDD[String] =\n  sqlContext.sparkContext.parallelize(\n    \"\"\"{\"a\": 3, \"b\": 1.1}\"\"\" ::\n    \"\"\"{\"a\": 3.1, \"b\": 1}\"\"\" :: Nil)\n\nval jsonDF = sqlContext.read\n  .option(\"prefersDecimal\", \"true\")\n  .json(mixedIntegerAndDoubleRecords)\n  .printSchema()\n```\n- **Before**\n\n```\nroot\n |-- a: string (nullable = true)\n |-- b: string (nullable = true)\n```\n- **After**\n\n```\nroot\n |-- a: decimal(21, 1) (nullable = true)\n |-- b: decimal(21, 1) (nullable = true)\n```\n\n(Note that integer is inferred as `LongType` which becomes `DecimalType(20, 0)`)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests were used and style tests by `dev/run_tests`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-28T05:22:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:52Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T07:32:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffd801b209c38aaa65b0aa9a13e2da59506b6354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5cb95bd21bd4b6ac931ac06a8850df174f2b194e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14189","ref":"SPARK-14189","sha":"5cb95bd21bd4b6ac931ac06a8850df174f2b194e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Supports native execution of SHOW DATABASES command\n2. Fixes SHOW TABLES to apply the identifier_with_wildcards pattern if supplied.\n\nSHOW TABLE syntax\n\n```\nSHOW TABLES [IN database_name] ['identifier_with_wildcards'];\n```\n\nSHOW DATABASES syntax\n\n```\nSHOW (DATABASES|SCHEMAS) [LIKE 'identifier_with_wildcards'];\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests added in SQLQuerySuite (both hive and sql contexts) and DDLCommandSuite\n\nNote: Since the table name pattern was not working , tests are added in both SQLQuerySuite to\nverify the application of the table pattern.\n","created_at":"2016-03-28T03:03:40Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T17:11:12Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T16:29:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54793caf8e84bb4a3186fd424d1f52430afb71da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bafca92906aaaa0a62d255f8067e11531d4609da","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:dkb_show_database","ref":"dkb_show_database","sha":"bafca92906aaaa0a62d255f8067e11531d4609da","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR tries to support more options for feature subset size in RandomForest implementation. Previously, RandomForest only support \"auto\", \"all\", \"sort\", \"log2\", \"onethird\". This PR tries to support any given value to allow model search.\n\nIn this PR, `featureSubsetStrategy` could be passed with:\na) a real number in the range of `(0.0-1.0]` that represents the fraction of the number of features in each subset,\nb)  an integer number (`>0`) that represents the number of features in each subset.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTwo tests `JavaRandomForestClassifierSuite` and `JavaRandomForestRegressorSuite` have been updated to check the additional options for params in this PR.\nAn additional test has been added to `org.apache.spark.mllib.tree.RandomForestSuite` to cover the cases in this PR.\n","created_at":"2016-03-27T23:28:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T18:33:34Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T14:55:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aec0818019df89717fb2c4048cc8a2d65bf6f146","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a4c29804848ccbcf472ec330be04536013deb8b","head":{"label":"yongtang:SPARK-3724","ref":"SPARK-3724","sha":"8a4c29804848ccbcf472ec330be04536013deb8b","user":{"login":"yongtang","id":6932348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzIzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6932348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang","html_url":"https://github.com/yongtang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5e64dab868be1a0d415fb6d6dd3463e7171fdd1a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to provide native parsing support for DDL commands: `Alter View`. Since its AST trees are highly similar to `Alter Table`. Thus, both implementation are integrated into the same one.\n\nBased on the Hive DDL document:\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL and https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/PartitionedViews\n##### 1. ALTER VIEW RENAME\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nALTER VIEW view_name RENAME TO new_view_name\n```\n- to change the name of a view to a different name\n##### 2. ALTER VIEW SET TBLPROPERTIES\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nALTER VIEW view_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('comment' = new_comment);\n```\n- to add metadata to a view\n##### 3. ALTER VIEW UNSET TBLPROPERTIES\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nALTER VIEW view_name UNSET TBLPROPERTIES [IF EXISTS] ('comment', 'key')\n```\n- to remove metadata from a view\n##### 4. ALTER VIEW ADD PARTITION\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nALTER VIEW view_name ADD [IF NOT EXISTS] PARTITION spec1[, PARTITION spec2, ...]\n```\n- to add the partitioning metadata for a view.\n- the syntax of partition spec in `ALTER VIEW` is identical to `ALTER TABLE`, **EXCEPT** that it is **ILLEGAL** to specify a `LOCATION` clause.\n##### 5. ALTER VIEW DROP PARTITION\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nALTER VIEW view_name DROP [IF EXISTS] PARTITION spec1[, PARTITION spec2, ...]\n```\n- to drop the related partition metadata for a view.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded the related test cases to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR reduces Java byte code size of method in `SpecificColumnarIterator` by using two approaches:\n1. Generate and call `getTYPEColumnAccessor()` for each type, which is actually used, for instantiating accessors\n2. Group a lot of method calls (more than 4000) into a method\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new unit test to `InMemoryColumnarQuerySuite`\n\nHere is generate code\n\n``` java\n/* 033 */

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a _prototype_.  It will be used to decide whether or not to proceed with [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14100].\n\nSummary of results of this prototype\n- This merge should be doable incrementally.\n- The merge is simple, except for algorithms with inconsistent Estimator-Model APIs (such as \"labels\" for StringIndexer).\n- Changes to unit tests and examples should be minimal.  This does not include updates to docs or example code, but those should be minimal as well.\n\nHow to read the PR: To understand what is needed when updating 1 model, look at the changes to:\n- StringIndexer.scala\n- features.py\n- unit tests\n\nMain changes\n- Created new abstraction MutableEstimator which will eventually replace Estimator for Spark 2.0.\n  - MutableEstimator inherits from Transformer, and it contains method `fit()`.\n  - It does not contain fit() methods taking ParamMaps.  The expected behavior of such methods becomes more ambiguous since it is unclear if they modify the current instance.\n- Merged StringIndexer and StringIndexerModel, where the merged abstraction now inherits from MutableEstimator.\n- Did the same for the Python API.  Also added JavaMutableEstimator for Python wrappers.\n\nOther required changes\n- Modified Pipeline to handle MutableEstimator.\n\nOther proposed changes\n- Deprecated transform() methods in Transformer taking Param settings.\n- Added `copy()` without arguments to PipelineStage since this will be a more common operation after the merge.\n- Added more `set()` methods to Params to facilitate setting Param values, now that fit() and transform() methods taking ParamMaps are going to be removed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests.  Note that the required changes were minimal.\n\nMore changes to meta-algorithms such as CrossValidator may be needed as we merge other Estimator-Model pairs.\n","created_at":"2016-03-27T00:39:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T21:30:03Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T21:30:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3f9892406e042ec245ca5c7486f5db487353e02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/367d25c3467320dcbfcad984d93120861ce36a16","head":{"label":"jkbradley:thunterdb-14100","ref":"thunterdb-14100","sha":"367d25c3467320dcbfcad984d93120861ce36a16","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

`degreesOfFreedom`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-26T23:28:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T02:32:13Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T02:32:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70f393097567d8867fdb52d511e72eb55f599b7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ec3d6ec1bc90ef7e9092935350d7ef6ea9509c1","head":{"label":"yongtang:SPARK-14163","ref":"SPARK-14163","sha":"6ec3d6ec1bc90ef7e9092935350d7ef6ea9509c1","user":{"login":"yongtang","id":6932348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzIzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6932348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang","html_url":"https://github.com/yongtang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongtang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b547de8a60074ca25c5bec3a24511f8042bdf0ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRowEncoder now respects nullability for struct fields when creating extractor expressions in the extractorsFor method.\n\nNote that to get the correct value for nullable for the returned expression i chose to drop the If statement checking for nulls if the field has nullable=false. If this is undesired because we should defensively be checking for nulls anyhow with the If statement then that can be achieved as well, by modifying the If class, however to me that solution seems less clear/elegant.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit test in DataFrameSuite for the bug described in the jira issue.\n","created_at":"2016-03-26T20:53:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T02:07:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-20T02:07:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2084be5bb6184b46fa11c22cb87c0854df48b06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9a9a30e1804785d3534bea78cf2ce588f7fc51b","head":{"label":"tresata-opensource:feat-rowencoder-nullable","ref":"feat-rowencoder-nullable","sha":"e9a9a30e1804785d3534bea78cf2ce588f7fc51b","user":{"login":"tresata-opensource","id":9121872,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkxMjE4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9121872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource","html_url":"https://github.com/tresata-opensource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tresata-opensource/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tresata-opensource","id":9121872,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkxMjE4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9121872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource","html_url":"https://github.com/tresata-opensource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tresata-opensource/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tresata-opensource/spark","description":"Mirror

Remove the closure cleaning in HadoopRDD init, which was mainly added to check if HadoopRDD can be made serializable or not.\n2. Directly instantiate HadoopRDD in OrcRelation, instead of going via SparkContext.hadoopRDD (which internally invokes threaddump in \"withScope\"). Clubbing this change instead of making a separate ticket for this minor change.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new tests have been added. Used the following code to measure overhead the HadoopRDD init codepath. With patch it took 340ms as opposed to 4815ms without patch.\n\nAlso tested with number of queries from TPC-DS in multi node environment. Along with, ran the following unit tests

DESCRIBE DATABASE\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nDESCRIBE DATABASE [EXTENDED] db_name\n```\n- `DESCRIBE DATABASE` shows the name of the database, its comment (if one has been set), and its root location on the filesystem. When `extended` is true, it also shows the database's properties\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded the related test cases to `DDLCommandSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-03-26T07:01:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-27T03:14:18Z","closed_at":"2016-03-27T03:14:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68ce739d00b1ebb5a2bc3d6e161071eb932060ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6517f1fdc4aefd4ae7629456bbbfc4eb01e17825","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:parseAlterDatabase","ref":"parseAlterDatabase","sha":"6517f1fdc4aefd4ae7629456bbbfc4eb01e17825","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSession catalog was added in #11750. However, it doesn't really support temporary functions properly; right now we only store the metadata in the form of `CatalogFunction`, but this doesn't make sense for temporary functions because there is no class name.\n\nThis patch moves the `FunctionRegistry` into the `SessionCatalog`. With this, the user can call `catalog.createTempFunction` and `catalog.lookupFunction` to use the function they registered previously. This is currently still dead code, however.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`SessionCatalogSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-26T00:00:37Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T01:42:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T23:47:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b24ca613997e58f8444d1327bb5c0f48c5a0ec82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11972/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11972/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11972/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/271227cfa0c99526ac3f2baed359065d195e2ec3","head":{"label":"andrewor14:temp-functions","ref":"temp-functions","sha":"271227cfa0c99526ac3f2baed359065d195e2ec3","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nNow that GBTs have been moved to ML, they can use the implementation of feature importance for random forests. This patch simply adds a `featureImportances` attribute to `GBTClassifier` and `GBTRegressor` and adds tests for each. \n\nGBT feature importances here simply average the feature importances for each tree in its ensemble. This follows the implementation from scikit-learn. This method is also suggested by J Friedman in [this paper](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were added to `GBTClassifierSuite` and `GBTRegressorSuite` to validate feature importances.\n","created_at":"2016-03-25T16:38:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T05:29:33Z","closed_at":"2016-03-29T05:29:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f721371c989d27370338e0662f58811d15eafab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/083b037f3b62cf9272b1816e6a295968e8ff9c72","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-11730","ref":"SPARK-11730","sha":"083b037f3b62cf9272b1816e6a295968e8ff9c72","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

R predict also does not output intermediate feature column. So SparkR `predict` should not output feature column.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14156\n\nIn HiveComparisonTest, when catalyst results are different to hive results, we will collect the messages for computed tables during the test. During creating the message, we use sparkPlan. But we actually run the query with executedPlan. So the error message is sometimes confusing.\n\nFor example, as wholestage codegen is enabled by default now. The shown spark plan for computed tables is the plan before wholestage codegen.\n\nA concrete is the following error message shown before this patch. It is the error shown when running `HiveCompatibilityTest` `auto_join26`.\n\nauto_join26 has one SQL to create table:\n\n```\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest_j1\nSELECT  x.key, count(1) FROM src1 x JOIN src y ON (x.key = y.key) group by x.key;   (1)\n```\n\nThen a SQL to retrieve the result:\n\n```\nselect * from dest_j1 x order by x.key;   (2)\n```\n\nWhen the above SQL (2) to retrieve the result fails, In `HiveComparisonTest` we will try to collect and show the generated data from table `dest_j1` using the SQL (1)'s spark plan. The you will see this error:\n\n```\nTungstenAggregate(key=[key#8804], functions=[(count(1),mode=Partial,isDistinct=false)], output=[key#8804,count#8834L])\n+- Project [key#8804]\n   +- BroadcastHashJoin [key#8804], [key#8806], Inner, BuildRight, None\n      :- Filter isnotnull(key#8804)\n      :  +- InMemoryColumnarTableScan [key#8804], [isnotnull(key#8804)], InMemoryRelation [key#8804,value#8805], true, 5, StorageLevel(true, true, false, true, 1), HiveTableScan [key#8717,value#8718], MetastoreRelation default, src1, None, Some(src1)\n      +- Filter isnotnull(key#8806)\n         +- InMemoryColumnarTableScan [key#8806], [isnotnull(key#8806)], InMemoryRelation [key#8806,value#8807], true, 5, StorageLevel(true, true, false, true, 1), HiveTableScan [key#8760,value#8761], MetastoreRelation default, src, None, Some(src)\n\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.errors.package$.attachTree(package.scala:47)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.TungstenAggregate.doExecute(TungstenAggregate.scala:82)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$execute$1.apply(SparkPlan.scala:121)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$execute$1.apply(SparkPlan.scala:121)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$executeQuery$1.apply(SparkPlan.scala:140)\nat org.apache.spark.rdd.RDDOperationScope$.withScope(RDDOperationScope.scala:151)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan.executeQuery(SparkPlan.scala:137)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan.execute(SparkPlan.scala:120)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.TungstenAggregate$$anonfun$doExecute$1.apply(TungstenAggregate.scala:87)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.TungstenAggregate$$anonfun$doExecute$1.apply(TungstenAggregate.scala:82)\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.errors.package$.attachTree(package.scala:46)\n... 70 more\nCaused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Filter does not implement doExecuteBroadcast\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan.doExecuteBroadcast(SparkPlan.scala:221)\n```\n\nThe message is confusing because it is not the plan actually run by SparkSQL engine to create the generated table. The plan actually run is no problem. But as before this patch, we run `e.sparkPlan.collect` to retrieve and show the generated data, spark plan is not the plan we can run. So the above error will be shown.\n\nAfter this patch, we won't see the error because the executed plan is no problem and works.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR generates Java code to get a float/double value of each column from CachedBatch when DataFrame.cache() is called. This is done in whole stage code generation.\n\nWhen DataFrame.cache() is called, data is stored as column-oriented storage (columnar cache) in CachedBatch. This PR avoid conversion from column-oriented storage to row-oriented storage.\n\nThis PR handles only float and double that are stored in a column without compression. Another PR will handle other primitive types that may be stored in a column in a compressed format. This is for ease of review by reducing the size of PR\n\nThis PR consists of two parts.\n1. Pass data in CachedBatch to generated code by using `decompress()` method. CachedBatch consists of multiple ByteBuffer arrays. A ByteBuffer is just passed to generated code.\n2. Generate code both for row-oriented storage and column-oriented storage only if\n   - InMemoryColumnarTableScan exists in a plan sub-tree. A decision is performed by checking an given iterator is ColumnaIterator at runtime\n   - Sort or join does not exist in a plan sub-tree. \n\nThis PR generates Java code for columnar cache only if types in all columns, which are accessed in operations, are primitive\n\nThis PR improves performance of aggregate sum by 3.8x - 5.2x.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe ran into a problem today debugging some class loading problem during deserialization, and JVM was masking the underlying exception which made it very difficult to debug. We can however log the exceptions using try/catch ourselves in serialization/deserialization. The good thing is that all these methods are already using Utils.tryOrIOException, so we can just put the try catch and logging in a single place.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA logging change with a manual test.\n","created_at":"2016-03-25T06:14:02Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T08:28:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-25T08:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c62c98367102633504ddb2addd015c89536cb58d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11951/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11951/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11951/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed7766f526e82ce37099340952c9c5ce7c32478f","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14149","ref":"SPARK-14149","sha":"ed7766f526e82ce37099340952c9c5ce7c32478f","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDataset has two variants of groupByKey, one for untyped and the other for typed. It actually doesn't make as much sense to have an untyped API here, since apps that want to use untyped APIs should just use the groupBy \"DataFrame\" API.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch

The `MemoryManager`'s `storageMemoryPool` has been split into separate on- and off-heap pools and the storage and unroll memory allocation methods have been updated to accept a `memoryMode` parameter

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nParam setters in python previously accessed the _paramMap directly to update values. The `_set` method now implements type checking, so it should be used to update all parameters. This PR eliminates all direct accesses to `_paramMap` besides the one in the `_set` method to ensure type checking happens. \n\nAdditional changes:\n- [SPARK-13068](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11663) missed adding type converters in evaluation.py so those are done here\n- An incorrect `toBoolean` type converter was used for StringIndexer `handleInvalid` param in previous PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR implements `FileFormat.buildReader()` for our ORC data source. It also fixed several minor styling issues related to `HadoopFsRelation` planning code path.\n\nNote that `OrcNewInputFormat` doesn't rely on `OrcNewSplit` for creating `OrcRecordReader`s, plain `FileSplit` is just fine. That's why we can simply create the record reader with the help of `OrcNewInputFormat` and `FileSplit`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test cases should do the work\n","created_at":"2016-03-24T15:58:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T16:58:14Z","closed_at":"2016-03-26T23:12:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35fbac6470422cd5b39cdb3a1c3fac0e52a89e17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11936/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11936/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11936/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25d894f02148ef2bf0018c7fb83ea798f3ad6e4a","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14116-build-reader-for-orc","ref":"spark-14116-build-reader-for-orc","sha":"25d894f02148ef2bf0018c7fb83ea798f3ad6e4a","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11410, we missed a corner case: define the inner class and use it in `Dataset` at the same time by using paste mode. For this case, the inner class and the `Dataset` are inside same line object, when we build the `Dataset`, we try to get outer pointer from line object, and it will fail because the line object is not initialized yet.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13456?focusedCommentId=15209174&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15209174 is an example for this corner case.\n\nThis PR make the process of getting outer pointer from line object lazy, so that we can successfully build the `Dataset` and finish initializing the line object.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in repl suite.\n","created_at":"2016-03-24T07:34:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T12:20:59Z","closed_at":"2016-03-25T12:20:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f00cd3b173bbef374afb1dce304004544925eae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f7e1f25a3f5a2de6aa9dd4cd6edcabcb60b55763","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:repl","ref":"repl","sha":"f7e1f25a3f5a2de6aa9dd4cd6edcabcb60b55763","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to introduce unique constraints over a set of `AttributeReference`s. Below are just two of use cases:\n- Remove unnecessary `Distinct` from the plan, as shown in the PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11854. \n- Eliminate the no-op `Join` from the plan, as shown in the PR: \n  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9089\n\nWe can infer the output uniqueness of the current operator through the uniqueness of the child node's output. The bottom-up propagation rule of unique constraints is \n- `Distinct`, `Intersect`, `Except` always return distinct values. \n- `Aggregate` has three cases:\n  1. When its aggregate expressions is identical to its grouping expressions, it is equivalent to `Distinct`. It can always return distinct values.\n  2. When the child's `outputSet` is subset of its own `outputSet`, it keeps the unique constraints of the child.\n  3. Otherwise, it does not enforce unique constraints\n- UnaryNode `Filter`, `BroadcastHint`, `Sort`, `Window`, `GlobalLimit`, `LocalLimit`, `Sample` and `SubqueryAlias` still keep the unique constraints of the child.\n- BinaryNode `Left-semi Join` keeps the unique constraints of the left child.\n- `Project` keeps the unique constraints of the child if and only if the child's `outputSet` is subset of its own `outputSet`\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nTODO: add a set of test cases for verifying the propagation rules\n","created_at":"2016-03-24T06:54:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T21:12:34Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T21:12:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"407e1a4666ed0fc5102e62f174d08b254a2f64a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aea61460ca904883c68cf27e9dacc5ee617efb8e","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:uniquenessConstraints","ref":"uniquenessConstraints","sha":"aea61460ca904883c68cf27e9dacc5ee617efb8e","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn case of failure in subprocess launched in PipedRDD, the failure exception reads “Subprocess exited with status XXX”. Debugging this is not easy for users especially if there are multiple pipe() operations in the Spark application. \n\nChanges done:\n- Changed the exception message when non-zero exit code is seen\n- If the reader and writer threads see exception, simply logging the command ran. The current model is to propagate the exception \"as is\" so that upstream Spark logic will take the right action based on what the exception was (eg. for fetch failure, it needs to retry; but for some fatal exception, it will decide to fail the stage / job). So wrapping the exception with a generic exception will not work. Altering the exception message will keep that guarantee but that is ugly (plus not all exceptions might have a constructor for a string message)\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added a new test case\n- Ran all existing tests for PipedRDD\n","created_at":"2016-03-24T04:03:02Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T20:53:45Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T09:25:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e36f7ed9e07118914f23e4d07d02dc6cde7549b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9929da95ad29a2568b5891d4627627220999c3b7","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-14110-piperdd-failure","ref":"SPARK-14110-piperdd-failure","sha":"9929da95ad29a2568b5891d4627627220999c3b7","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14111\n\nWe use output of logical plan as schema. Output nullablity is important and we should keep its correctness.\n\nWith constraints and optimization, in fact we will change output nullability of logical plans. But we don't reflect such changes in the output attributes. So the output nullablity is not correct now.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified `InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite` and `AnalysisSuite`. Existing tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-24T03:33:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:22Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T06:28:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08f35604014190f4f3f7493c98bd05da3174addf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6dabcd38f4822e19f989b2196d52ea9e806af3b","head":{"label":"viirya:output-nullable-with-constraint3","ref":"output-nullable-with-constraint3","sha":"c6dabcd38f4822e19f989b2196d52ea9e806af3b","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror
