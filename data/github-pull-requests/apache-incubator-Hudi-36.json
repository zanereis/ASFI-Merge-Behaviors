Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn the following scenario, before this fix, the validation job fires a false alarm complaining that the partition list returned by the file system does not match that of the metadata table:\r\n- Commit C1 creates the partition, the partition metadata is written, and C1 fails during writing data files.  Next time, C2 adds new data to the same partition after C1 is rolled back. In this case, the partition metadata still has C1 as the created commit time, since Hudi does not rewrite the partition metadata in C2.  Note that there are other commits in the active timeline before C1, which created existing partitions.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the validator filters the partition out in the partition list returned by the file system, thinking that the partition is created by a failed commit and should not be included.\r\n\r\n```\r\n23/03/11 00:27:18 ERROR HoodieMetadataTableValidator: Compare Partitions Failed!

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the configs for Deltastreamer and schema providers to config classes extending `HoodieConfig` and using `ConfigProperty`, so that when we generate the documentation of configurations for Hudi website, these configs are surfaced.  Configs in the following classes are in scope:\r\n```\r\nInitialCheckPointProvider\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer\r\nHoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer\r\nFilebasedSchemaProvider\r\nHiveSchemaProvider\r\nJdbcbasedSchemaProvider\r\nProtoClassBasedSchemaProvider\r\nSchemaPostProcessor\r\nSchemaRegistryProvider\r\nSparkAvroPostProcessor\r\nDropColumnSchemaPostProcessor\r\nBaseSchemaPostProcessorConfig\r\nKafkaOffsetPostProcessor\r\nSanitizationUtils\r\n'hoodie.deltastreamer.multiwriter.source.checkpoint.id' in HoodieWriteConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdds the configs to the configuration docs around Deltastreamer and schema providers.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe need to update the configuration docs in `asf-site` branch by auto-populating the changes.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR tweaks a few defaults and remove unnecessary configs after config review:\r\n- `hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.table`: add default value of `hudi_locks`\r\n- `hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.table_creation_timeout`: default changed from 10 minutes to 2 minutes\r\n- `hoodie.clustering.preserve.commit.metadata`: removed since this should always be true\r\n- `hoodie.compaction.preserve.commit.metadata`: removed since this should always be true\r\n- `hoodie.write.lock.max_wait_time_ms_between_retry`: default changed from 5s to 16s\r\n- `hoodie.write.commit.callback.http.timeout.seconds`: default changed from 3s to 30s\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRemoves configs that should not be changed and flip the defaults to values that make more sense.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nRegenerates the configuration page in `asf-site` branch.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix `testHoodieFlinkClusteringScheduleAfterArchive()`.  Fixes the test in https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7891.\r\n\r\nThe fix here will use `String.contains` method to make the test path agnostic. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone, this fixes the test such that it will fail on Hudi versions without the fix.\r\n\r\nWhen `FSUtils.getCommitTime(HoodieSliceInfo.getDataFilePath())` is used, it will return the `writeToken` of a file instead of instantTime, causing the anyMatch to always return false.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nExecuting `FSUtils.getCommitTime()` on the string below will return `0-1-0`\r\n```\r\n/var/folders/p_/09zfm5sx3v14w97hhk4vqrn8s817xt/T/junit8134894453710103701/par2/27cab7e5-b7ac-41df-b5da-2bf105c89ea9-1_0-1-0_20230307150705289.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR is introducing capability for Record Key Auto Generation\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nAt present ingesting data into Hudi has a few unavoidable prerequisites one of which is specifying record key configuration (with record key serving as primary key). Necessity to specify primary key is one of the core assumptions built into Hudi model centered around being able to update the target table efficiently.\r\n\r\nHowever, some payloads actually don't have a naturally present record key: for ex, when ingesting some kind of \"logs\" into Hudi there might be no unique identifier held in every record that could serve the purpose of being record key, while meeting global uniqueness requirements of the primary key. Nevertheless, we want to make sure that Hudi is able to support such payloads while still providing for Hudi's core strength\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n1. Auto-generated record keys have to provide for global uniqueness w/in the table, not just w/in the batch. \r\nThis is necessary to make sure we're able to support updating such tables.\r\n2. Keys should be generated in a way that would allow for their efficient compression\r\nThis is necessary to make sure that auto-generated keys are not bringing substantial overhead (on storage and in handling)\r\n3. Auto generation of record keys should be robust against partial failures and retries like task and stage failures and retries. In other words, such events should not result in data duplication or data loss. \r\n\r\nNo new configs are added for the purpose. If user configures value for 'hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field', it will be honored. If not, auto record key generation will chime in. So, its expected to work with any key gen class. \r\n \r\n#### Implementation\r\nTo support payloads with no naturally present record key, here we're proposing to enable new mode of operation for Hudi where synthetic, globally unique (w/in the table) record key will be injected upon persistence of the dataset as Hudi table.\r\n\r\nFor achieving our goal of providing globally unique keys we're planning on relying on the following synthetic key format comprised of 2 components\r\n\r\n - (Reserved) Commit timestamp: Use reserved commit timestamp as prefix (to provide for global uniqueness of rows)\r\n - Engine's task partitionId or parallelizable unit for the engine of interest. (Spark PartitionId incase of spark engine)\r\n - Row id: unique identifier of the row (record) w/in the provided task partition. \r\n\r\nCombining them in a single string key as below\r\n\r\n```\"${commit_timestamp}_${partition_id}_${row_id}\"```\r\n\r\nFor row-id generation we're planning on using generator very similar in spirit to `monotonically_increasing_id()` expression from Spark to generate unique identity value for every row w/in batch (could be easily implemented for any parallel execution framework like Flink, etc)\r\n\r\nPlease note, that this setup is very similar to how currently `_hoodie_commit_seqno` is produced.\r\n\r\n- Added support to all 4 different writes in spark(spark ds, spark streaming, spark-ds and deltastreamer). \r\n    - Having said that hudi already supports inferring partition path from incoming dataframe, users can now realize auto key generation w/ hudi using following examples.\r\n    \r\n```\r\na. non-partitioned. df.write.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path) \r\nb. partitioned dataset. df.write.partitionBy(colA).format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path)\r\nc. multi-field partitioning: df.write.partitionBy(colA, colB).format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path) \r\n```\r\n\r\n- Added/Fixed all built in key generators to support auto generation of record keys. \r\n- Added guard rails around some of the configs when used along side auto generation of record keys (for eg, de-dup within same batch is not allowed. \r\n\r\nFollow up work items:\r\nSupport updates and deletes for table w/ auto generation record keys: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1885\r\nSupport merge into for table w/ auto generation record keys: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3314 \r\nAlso a related patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4702. \r\nFlink support: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6161\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Eases the usability of Hudi among users who are looking to ingest immutable datasets. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWill be updating the configurations page on this.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, savepoint only considers the completed clean instant. It is possible just before savepoint started, a clean instant was inflight. Savepoint completed as well as clean complated. But, now when we do restore to that savepoint, it will fail as the cleaner would have cleaned up the instant. This PR fixes that by aborting savepoint if there is a pending clean with earliest commit to retain greater than savepoint instant.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change. Fixing a corner case in savepoint.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\n- relax MDT pending instants deduction to compact to ignore compaction and clustering from DT.;\r\n- Ensure compaction of MDT ignores uncommitted data;\r\n- this might work only for spurious deletes ignored flow. \r\n\r\n#### New Workflow\r\n\r\n1. t5: assumes there is requested compaction at t5 on DT timeline:\r\n\r\nDT: t5.compaction.req\r\n\r\n2. t10: the MDT compaction triggers (ignore the pending t5 on DT)\r\n\r\nMDT: t10_002.commit\r\n\r\n3. t20: DT triggers a ROLLBACK for t5\r\n\r\nDT: t20.rb\r\nMDT: t20.dc\r\n\r\nWe may not know if t5 was already committed to MDT or not.\r\nAnd hence had to go for -F records. (only works for spurious deletes ignore flow). \r\n\r\n4. t30: t5 is retried and succeed in MDT but failed in DT (attempt1)\r\n\r\nMDT: t5.dc with files f10, f11.\r\nDT: crash\r\n\r\n5. t31: MDT compaction triggered\r\n\r\nMDT: t31_002.commit\r\n\r\nThe rollback payload for t5 in MDT decides that t5 is already synced. We do -F.\r\n\r\n6. t40: t5 is retried and filed to commit to MDT (attempt2)\r\n\r\nDT: t5.compaction.req._2nd with files f20, f21.\r\ncrash\r\n\r\nThe rollback payload for t5 in MDT decides that t5 is not synced. We do -F with tombstone messages (only works for spurious deletes ignore flow))\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCould reduce the metadata small files significantly for MOR table. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-03T02:15:08Z","updated_at":"2023-05-28T01:34:35Z","closed_at":"2023-05-28T01:34:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f5ad9c97be457d6d865c07f45f3c6022b19669f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3366016062,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzY2MDE2MDYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/metadata","name":"metadata","color":"F9F12C","default":false,"description":"metadata

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn 0.13.0 and latest master, the table service client `BaseHoodieTableServiceClient` is instantiated without any timeline server instance, even if the regular write client has one.  This causes the table service client to start a new embedded timeline server and overwrite the write config passed in from the constructor so that the write config points to the newly started timeline server.  The issue is introduced by #6732, adding the Hudi table service manager.\r\n\r\nAs the regular write client such as `SparkRDDWriteClient` directly passes in the same writeConfig instance, the regular write client's write config is also affected, causing the regular write client to use the newly started embedded timeline server always, instead of the timeline server instance passed in from the constructor or the one instantiated by the regular write client itself.\r\n\r\nThis means that the Deltastreamer's long-lived timeline server is never going to be used because of this issue.\r\n\r\nNote that, this issue does not cause a correctness issue; nevertheless, at least one additional timeline server is instantiated because of the issue, which is never used during the write transaction, wasting compute and memory resources.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by properly initiating the table service client with the timeline server from the regular write client.\r\n\r\nThree new tests are added to make sure the timeline server used by the write client and the table service client is expected:\r\n- `TestSparkRDDWriteClient#testWriteClientAndTableServiceClientWithTimelineServer`\r\n- `TestFlinkWriteClient#testWriteClientAndTableServiceClientWithTimelineServer`\r\n- `TestHoodieJavaWriteClientInsert#testWriteClientAndTableServiceClientWithTimelineServer`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis makes sure that the timeline server instance passed to the regular write client is used by the write transaction.\r\n\r\nThe new tests added guard the behavior:\r\n- `TestSparkRDDWriteClient#testWriteClientAndTableServiceClientWithTimelineServer`\r\n- `TestFlinkWriteClient#testWriteClientAndTableServiceClientWithTimelineServer`\r\n- `TestHoodieJavaWriteClientInsert#testWriteClientAndTableServiceClientWithTimelineServer`\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, these tests fail:\r\n<img width=\"728\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 23 11 05\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/226090585-2082a864-d22f-4f4d-ace5-4308c0e88d89.png\">\r\n<img

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe observe that for MOR table, occasionally (<10% for large tables with frequent updates and compactions, <1% of updates affected), the deltacommit after the compaction commit may add a new log file to the old file slice, not the latest file slice, in the corresponding file group.  This happens when both the metadata table and timeline server are enabled.  If either is disabled, the problem does not show up.  This means that any data written to the log file is lost, i.e., data loss issue.\r\n\r\nDeeper analysis of the code surfaces that the file system view at the timeline server may serve the stale view, causing the issue.  This is because the sync of `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView` is not atomic when the metadata table is enabled.\r\n\r\nHere's a concrete walkthrough of how this problem can happen.  When the timeline server is long-running and passed to the write client for reusing (like Deltastreamer), the timeline server internally needs to refresh and sync the outdated file system view if it is behind what the client (which sends the request to the timeline server) sees.  This is based on whether the latest instant seen by the client matches what timeline server's file system view has.  The sync logic is implemented in `RequestHandler`:\r\n```\r\n[L1]  private boolean syncIfLocalViewBehind(Context ctx) {\r\n[L2]    if (isLocalViewBehind(ctx)) {\r\n[L3]      String basePath = ctx.queryParam(RemoteHoodieTableFileSystemView.BASEPATH_PARAM);\r\n[L4]      String lastKnownInstantFromClient = ctx.queryParamAsClass(RemoteHoodieTableFileSystemView.LAST_INSTANT_TS, String.class).getOrDefault(HoodieTimeline.INVALID_INSTANT_TS);\r\n[L5]      SyncableFileSystemView view = viewManager.getFileSystemView(basePath);\r\n[L6]      synchronized (view) {\r\n[L7]        if (isLocalViewBehind(ctx)) {\r\n[L7]          HoodieTimeline localTimeline = viewManager.getFileSystemView(basePath).getTimeline();\r\n[L8]          LOG.info(\"Syncing view as client passed last known instant \" + lastKnownInstantFromClient\r\n[L9]              + \" as last known instant but server has the following last instant on timeline :\"\r\n[L10]              + localTimeline.lastInstant());\r\n[L11]          view.sync();\r\n[L12]          return true;\r\n[L13]        }\r\n[L14]      }\r\n[L15]    }\r\n[L16]    return false;\r\n[L17]  }\r\n```\r\n```\r\n  private boolean isLocalViewBehind(Context ctx) {\r\n    String basePath = ctx.queryParam(RemoteHoodieTableFileSystemView.BASEPATH_PARAM);\r\n    String lastKnownInstantFromClient =\r\n        ctx.queryParamAsClass(RemoteHoodieTableFileSystemView.LAST_INSTANT_TS, String.class).getOrDefault(HoodieTimeline.INVALID_INSTANT_TS);\r\n    String timelineHashFromClient = ctx.queryParamAsClass(RemoteHoodieTableFileSystemView.TIMELINE_HASH, String.class).getOrDefault(\"\");\r\n    HoodieTimeline localTimeline =\r\n        viewManager.getFileSystemView(basePath).getTimeline().filterCompletedOrMajorOrMinorCompactionInstants();\r\n    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\r\n      LOG.debug(\"Client [ LastTs=\" + lastKnownInstantFromClient + \", TimelineHash=\" + timelineHashFromClient\r\n          + \"], localTimeline=\" + localTimeline.getInstants());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if ((!localTimeline.getInstantsAsStream().findAny().isPresent())\r\n        && HoodieTimeline.INVALID_INSTANT_TS.equals(lastKnownInstantFromClient)) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    String localTimelineHash = localTimeline.getTimelineHash();\r\n    // refresh if timeline hash mismatches\r\n    if (!localTimelineHash.equals(timelineHashFromClient)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // As a safety check, even if hash is same, ensure instant is present\r\n    return !localTimeline.containsOrBeforeTimelineStarts(lastKnownInstantFromClient);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the implementation of `sync()` of the file system view based on the metadata table (`HoodieMetadataFileSystemView`):\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void sync() {\r\n    super.sync();\r\n    tableMetadata.reset();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe `super.sync()` calls the `sync()` in `AbstractTableFileSystemView`:\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void sync() {\r\n    HoodieTimeline oldTimeline = getTimeline();\r\n    HoodieTimeline newTimeline = metaClient.reloadActiveTimeline().filterCompletedOrMajorOrMinorCompactionInstants();\r\n    try {\r\n      writeLock.lock();\r\n      runSync(oldTimeline, newTimeline);\r\n    } finally {\r\n      writeLock.unlock();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nNote that, the file system view logic should be guarded by the read-write lock, i.e., any read of the cached file system info should be blocked before updates to the cache in the file system are fully done, which is guarded by the write lock.  However, we can see that for `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView`, the write lock covers the sync logic partially, and `tableMetadata.reset()` is not guarded by the write lock, meaning that it can create race condition that the metadata table content can be stale when being read.\r\n- When metadata table is enabled using `HoodieBackedTableMetadata`, `tableMetadata.reset()` has logic to execute.\r\n- When metadata table is disabled, with `FileSystemBackedTableMetadata`, `tableMetadata.reset()` is a no-op, so there is no issue.\r\n\r\nLet's now look at concurrent requests are handled in `RequestHandler` to cause the stale view to be read.  Consider two concurrent requests to the timeline server, REQ1 and REQ2:\r\n- Thread1 for REQ1: L2 with `syncIfLocalViewBehind()` returns `true`. Then enters synchronized block from L6 to sync the file system view.  In the middle, the timeline has already been updated, yet the metadata and file system view has not been refreshed.\r\n- Thread2 for REQ2: This comes after the timeline has been updated because of REQ1 at the timeline server, but metadata and the file system view is still in progress.  At this moment, L2 with `syncIfLocalViewBehind()` returns `false`, skipping the synchronized block and continue for getting the information from the file system view.  As mentioned above, given that the sync logic is not fully guarded by the write lock, the read lock thinks that the info is fully updated, thus allowing the file system view to return the info, which is stale.\r\n\r\nTo easily reproduce this race condition problem consistently, a new test `TestRemoteFileSystemViewWithMetadataTable` is added with `HoodieBackedTestDelayedTableMetadata` to delay the `reset()` process.  By applying the same change to the `HoodieBackedTableMetadata`, we can also reproduce the same problem with the Deltastreamer.\r\n\r\nThe fix is the following:\r\n- Makes sure all logic in `sync()` and `reset()` are guarded by the write lock.  This is done by implementing the logic with the write lock in each file system view, instead of overriding indect method (e.g., `runSync()`).\r\n- Simplifies the implementation of `syncIfLocalViewBehind()` to be more readable.\r\n\r\n**History and Impact of the problem:**\r\n\r\nThe problematic implementation of `sync()` and `reset()` in `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView` class is introduced by #4307 to properly sync and reset the file system view based on the metadata table.  This did not have an impact at that moment, as Hudi refreshes/synces the file system view explicitly while initializing the `HoodieTable` instance for each write, masking the issue.  Only when the file system view based on the metadata table is synced because of new requests at the timeline server, there's a chance of the `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView` serving a stale view, which is not hit when #4307 is landed.  Subsequently, two more optimization PRs, #5617 and #5716, are landed to remove \"unnecessary\" refreshes/syncs of the file system view when initializing the `HoodieTable` instance.  It turns out that without this PR properly fixing the `sync()` and `reset()` in `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView`, such refreshes and syncs are necessary to avoid potential stale and inconsistent views.  As the probability of hitting this issue is very low, it is not uncovered during manual testing or CI runs.\r\n\r\nAfter running the same tests added in this PR, it is found that the following Hudi releases are affected: `0.11.1`, `0.12.0`, `0.12.1`, `0.12.2`, `0.13.0`.  This also aligns with the findings around the offending PRs mentioned above.  Although the tests pass for `0.13.0`, because of another bug #8080 introduced in `0.13.0` release (timeline server instance passed to the write client is ignored due to this bug), there's still an impact on `0.13.0`.  #8134 reproduces the issue for `0.13.0`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the data loss issue and makes sure that the timeline server with the metadata table enabled (using `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView`) always serves the correct information.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested with deltastreamer writing MOR table with inline compaction in continuous mode, with intentional delay in `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` just like `HoodieBackedTestDelayedTableMetadata` to ensure the problem happens consistently before the fix.  After the fix, the problem goes away.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe need to update the release notes regarding this severe regression that can cause data loss: HUDI-5864.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T01:46:43Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T19:09:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-04T21:01:38Z","merged_at":"2023-03-04T21:01:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ddcf96cddb9e4cc4ff1427bccc432922b031225","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","sit

Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. For Spark SQL, add `bulk_insert` support for `insert_overwrite` and `insert_overwrite_table`\r\n3. Add tests to cover new feature\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nIn order to keep consistent behavior, this pr still deletes old data completely when overwriting whole table while enabling `BULK_INSERT`. Here's a table to better understand current HUDI behaviors under different `SaveMode` and `Operation`(Especially for `BULK_INSERT` and `INSERT_OVERWRITE` related).\r\n\r\ndataframe:\r\n| SaveMode | Operation | behavior| \r\n| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |\r\n|Overwrite| BULK_INSERT | delete whole table data |\r\n| Overwrite | INSERT_OVERWRITE_TABLE | use `replaceCommit` to overwrite all table data |\r\n| Overwrite | INSERT_OVERWRITE | delete whole table data |\r\n| Append | INSERT_OVERWRITE | use `replaceCommit` to overwrite old partitions |\r\n\r\nsql:\r\n| SQL Type | Operation | behavior(before) | behavior(after) |\r\n| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |\r\n| INSERT OVERWRITE | BULK_INSERT | delete whole table data | same |\r\n| INSERT OVERWRITE PARTITION | BULK_INSERT | Not Supported | use `replaceCommit` to overwrite old partitions |\r\n| INSERT OVERWRITE | INSERT_OVERWRITE_TABLE | use `replaceCommit` to overwrite all table data | same |\r\n| INSERT OVERWRITE PARTITION | INSERT_OVERWRITE | use `replaceCommit` to overwrite old partitions | same |\r\n\r\nThere still are some issues needed to be addressed,\r\n1. `INSERT_OVERWRITE` with `Overwrite` mode should not delete whole table data, it only needs to overwrite old partitions\r\n2. We should always keep old data for time travel purpose & ACID-compliance,  but currently `Overwrite` mode will delete all data first\r\n\r\ncreated a issue to track this: [HUDI-6286](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6286)\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSnapshot query result is wrong after apply insert overwrite to an existed table with simple bucket index.\r\nsee detailed in [HUDI-5857](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5857).\r\nThe root cause of the bug is the write handler reuses existed bucket file id for insert overwrite. Besides it use replace commit for insert overwrite operation and mark all the existed bucket file id as replaced. \r\nSo the snapshot query result is wrong.\r\nThe pr aims to fix this bug by generating new file id for bucket if insert overwrite into bucket index table.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAlign with Flink behaviour, since precombine is now optional in Spark let users do updates on Hudi table where precombine field is not defined.\r\nresolves #7282\r\n\r\nThis PR can be merged after #7998 is done as it depends on this fix to work.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo API change.\r\nUser-facing feature change - SQL UPDATE and upsert in Spark are allowed on CoW table with no PreCombine field specified.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\nSpark quick start guide should be updated, sql updates/ ds upserts are possible now on CoW (only) without PreCombine filed out of the box with no additional configuration provided by the user.\r\nUsers should be informed that UPSERT/ UPDATE without PreCombine field will not deduplicate the dataset.\r\nWe should make it clear that users will need to handle duplicated with DELETE and INSERT statements on their own and make sure to deduplicate incoming data if using Spark Hudi data source.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor MOR Table, restoring to a very old delta commit is very time consuming. since internally, we do rollback of 1 commit at a time. This standalone tool takes a stab at improving the performance of restore. You can choose a delta commit just before a compaction commit, and this tool will directly delete files for newer file slices after the delta commit chosen. \r\n\r\nthis tool does not yet suport restoring to middle of file slice. \r\nRestore timestamp has to be latest delta commit before any compaction commit. \r\n\r\nFor eg, \r\ndc1,\r\ndc2\r\nc3,\r\ndc4,\r\ndc5,\r\nc6, \r\ndc7, \r\ndc8, \r\nc9,\r\ndc10,\r\ndc11\r\n\r\n\r\nValid commit times to restore w/ this tool:\r\ndc2, or dc5, dc8. \r\n\r\nIn other words, this tool can only clean up entire file slices and hence. \r\n\r\nAfter cleaning up the data files, this toll will also delete the corresponding commit meta files from \".hoodie\". \r\n\r\nCaution:\r\nMetadata has to be disbaled. \r\nAnd this tool takesn unconventional route of not going via rollback. This tool directly lists the files and deletes them and also deleted the timeline files if necessary. \r\n\r\nSample command\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --num-executors 1 --executor-cores 2 --deploy-mode client --driver-memory 8g --executor-memory 8g  --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.MORRestoreTool BUNDLE_LOCATION/hudi-utilities-bundle_2.11-0.14.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --base-path /tmp/hudi_trips_more_restore/ --parallelism 4 --commitTime 20230225091008404 --spark-master local[2] --execute --cleanUpMetadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd relocated prefix(org.apache.hudi)  for hbase classes in hbase-site.xml, because we have relocated hbase classes in the bundle jar.  \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nMaybe it's better to put hbase-site.xml in bundle module instead of `hudi-common` module. But currently it seems that every bundle jar will relocated hbase classes, so it's fine to modify the hbase-site.xml in `hudi-common` module directly\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk level

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdates the MercifulJsonConverter to have more mercy by:\r\n1. Replaces field names with illegal avro name chars with __\r\n2. Leverages aliases in the avro schema if present\r\n\r\nThis issue is within the scope of row sources. The actual issue is that if the names of the columns in the row sources contain invalid avro characters ref [here|https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/spec.html#names] then using configuration set we can sanitize the column names both in the schema and actual data and the data ingestion to hudi isn't failed. The schema provider is scoped out to filebasedschemaregistry as other schema registries might not allow to register invalid schema in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact by default because configs are turned off by default. If turned on, data and schema(file based) are repaired, so the dataset contains renamed columns.\r\nAllows users to more easily get their data into hudi even if their json data has field names that are not avro compatible\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow (as it has to be turned on explicitly).\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nEven though the metadata table writer used by the async indexer is configured to use `LAZY` failed write cleaning policy, the `SparkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` is hard-coded to roll back failed writes regardless of the configuration, which should not be triggered for the async indexer.  In the current logic, the async indexer can trigger the rollback of inflight delta commit from another regular writer in the metadata table, causing issues.  This also makes the following test flaky.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `SparkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` so that the rollback of failed writes is not triggered by the async indexer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1573775Z [ERROR] Tests run: 113, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 2, Time elapsed: 3,518.191 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.TestHoodieDeltaStreamer\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1576031Z [ERROR] testHoodieIndexer{HoodieRecordType}[2]  Time elapsed: 79.838 s  <<< ERROR!\r\n...\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1705711Z Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1706251Z \tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.ValidationUtils.checkArgument(ValidationUtils.java:31)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1706995Z \tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.timeline.HoodieActiveTimeline.transitionState(HoodieActiveTimeline.java:633)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1707847Z \tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.timeline.HoodieActiveTimeline.transitionRequestedToInflight(HoodieActiveTimeline.java:698)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1708751Z \tat org.apache.hudi.table.action.commit.BaseCommitActionExecutor.saveWorkloadProfileMetadataToInflight(BaseCommitActionExecutor.java:147)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1709792Z \tat org.apache.hudi.table.action.commit.BaseSparkCommitActionExecutor.execute(BaseSparkCommitActionExecutor.java:172)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1710733Z \tat org.apache.hudi.table.action.deltacommit.SparkUpsertPreppedDeltaCommitActionExecutor.execute(SparkUpsertPreppedDeltaCommitActionExecutor.java:44)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1712815Z \tat org.apache.hudi.table.HoodieSparkMergeOnReadTable.upsertPrepped(HoodieSparkMergeOnReadTable.java:111)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1713593Z \tat org.apache.hudi.table.HoodieSparkMergeOnReadTable.upsertPrepped(HoodieSparkMergeOnReadTable.java:80)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1714353Z \tat org.apache.hudi.client.SparkRDDWriteClient.upsertPreppedRecords(SparkRDDWriteClient.java:154)\r\n2023-02-16T13:46:06.1715155Z \tat org.apache.hudi.metadata.SparkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter.commit(SparkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter.java:186)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the rollback behavior of async indexer.
