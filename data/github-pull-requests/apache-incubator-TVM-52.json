targets don't have an FP16 erf intrinsic. This causes compilation to fail when such an op is encountered. This PR adds two cases to avoid this failure. I've added an FP16 ERF legalization pass that will just cast to FP32 for the ERF call. I've also extended fast_erf to support FP16 directly. This does lose some precision compared to doing FP32 wrapping around ERF, but since the desire is to be faster I think it's acceptable

checked, as it was done for [GraphExecutor](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/c216cbec5bb795a8b13bdb1e177b523e4f7e4ca8/src/runtime/graph_executor/graph_executor.cc#L168).\r\nIn view of this, runtime

if the `vta_config.json` on the host side and the hardware side are the same, it will be judged as a different configuration, and the `libvta.so` file will be rebuilt.\r\nI found that the reason is that `old_cfg` is the original json object parsed from the file, but the obtained `cfg` is no longer the original json object, it adds some fields when building pkg. As the following code:\r\n```\r\n    # 3rdparty/vta-hw/config/pkg_config.py\r\n    def __init__(self, cfg):\r\n\r\n        # Derived parameters\r\n        cfg[\"LOG_BLOCK_IN\"] =

PR removes the type tvm_ssize_t introduced in ([PR11232](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11232/)) , and unifies the definition of ssize_t.\r\nInitially, there was an issue with the Windows build in ([PR10967](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10967)) , since the ssize_t was not properly defined in rpc_channel_logger.h \r\nour initial solution was to define the ssize_t in that specific file. but we got a redefinition error, since ssize_t was also defined in socket.h. We also tried to include socket.h in rpc_channel_logger.h but we got some errors on hexagon build. ([PR11223](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11223))\r\nNext attempt, we added another type, tvm_ssize_t, in c_runtime_api.h to resolve the redefinition issue ([PR11232](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11232/)) and the plan was to propagate tvm_ssize_t to most of other ssize_t mentions to minimize confusion. The PR got merged, however, there are two issues with this solution. First, the c_runtime_api.h doesn't seem to be the appropriate place for the definition and required header files ([here](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11232/#discussion_r876954435)), and ssize_t is widely used in the codebase, so propagating the tvm_ssize_t requires changes all over the codebase.\r\nThis brings us to this current solution. It is basically back to our initial solution of defining ssize_t where it is needed (rpc_channel_logger.h ), and resolving the redefinition error by placing the definition in ssize.h file, and including it in both places. I believe this solution makes more sense because it doesn't add an unnecessary and potentially confusing type tvm_ssize_t and keeps the ssize_t definitions consistent.\r\n@areusch, @mehrdadh,

finishes the work started in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11173 to support\r\n'external codegen' targets in the N build-like API surfaces, which in turn requires all the\r\nRelay-level build interfaces to support list-of-targets instead of dictionary-of-targets. And\r\nprepare for plumbing targets through the external codegen machinery.\r\n\r\n(See https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/byoc-supporting-cutlass-byoc-with-collage/12796/6 for\r\nmore context on build/target changes, and https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md\r\nfor the overall Collage RFC).\r\n\r\n - It turns out it's ok if a build is given only a single 'external codegen' target, so remove that check\r\n   in CompilationConfig::Init. (When Collage builds a 'candidate partition' it does so for a single target.\r\n   As far as Collage is concerned it does not care whether the target is regular (eg Target(\"cuda\")), or\r\n   for a specific external codegen (eg Target(\"cutlass\")), it just passes the target into the build.)\r\n\r\n - Add CompilationConfig::FindPrimitiveTargetForKind which I'll later need to retrieve\r\n   the external codegen Target instance corresponding to a \"Compiler\" attribute value.\r\n\r\n - Target.update_target_host_consist was supporting three API styles:\r\n    - single target\r\n    - map from device type to target\r\n    - map from target to IRModule (for the ir_to_runtime API)\r\n   \r\n   I replaced all those calls with a more specialized 'canonicalize' call:\r\n    - Target.canonicalize_target_and_host\r\n    - Target.canonicalize_multi_targets_and_host\r\n    - Target.canonicalize_target_map_and_host\r\n   \r\n   In particular, all the tuning interfaces (task extraction, tuning, tuning records) all explicitly\r\n   *do not* support multiple targets since that just doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\n - Rev the micro library format version from 5 to 6 since the 'target' attribute in the metadata.json\r\n   output is now an array rather than a dictionary. Remove the N uses of target.values() to follow\r\n   suite.","created_at":"2022-05-19T23:17:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T22:38:24Z","closed_at":"2022-05-23T16:14:28Z","merged_at":"2022-05-23T16:14:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1467777c66d20f32008c9cbf55d64f0cd8e401a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/715daab89f7b744b5c21be4a99d36b529e6f5485","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-collage-more-targets","ref":"mbs-collage-more-targets","sha":"715daab89f7b744b5c21be4a99d36b529e6f5485","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

came about after investigating some simplifications that may be useful for handling of padding introduced during padded layout transformations.\r\n\r\n- Enabled simplification of `A[i] = A[i] + 0` into no-op.  This was a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9727, which applied this rewrite only to `A[i] = A[i]`, and not to statements which simplify to `A[i] = A[i]`.  Regression test added to prevent reoccurrence of this bug.\r\n\r\n- Enabled simplification of `x - x` to zero for floating point types. Previously, this simplification was applied only for data types that could be used as buffer indices.","created_at":"2022-05-19T17:06:37Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T16:56:01Z","closed_at":"2022-05-26T16:26:30Z","merged_at":"2022-05-26T16:26:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"52df2e84141b34cda2b1e723c22d38b22796d6a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/069fba9a1cb786c1bd94140d2fa45162a63ae37c","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_simplify_rules","ref":"tir_simplify_rules","sha":"069fba9a1cb786c1bd94140d2fa45162a63ae37c","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a draft of implementation of 'set_output_zero_copy' method on VirtualMachine side.\r\n\r\nBrief description of approach.\r\n1. There is python API function 'set_output' which save external outputs in VM outputs_ field (map) for specified func name. It looks like 'set_input' method.\r\n2. During 'invoke' outputs_ are saved in register_file. For this the register indices of output tensors are found from code_ field. I observed in tests for different models that AllocTensor and AllocADT ops are used for result tensors. Let's consider these two cases: result index is destination for AllocTensor op or AllocADT op. At the first case instead of construction new NDArray the outside output tensor is used. At the second one the fields of AllocADT are analyzed and register indices are extracted. During tests I observed that ReshapeTensor operation is rarely used as final one (SqueezeNet-v1.0 and DUC). Mechanism for replacement by external output tensors was also implemented for this op.  \r\n\r\nNotes: 1. I'm not sure that it works for many frames. Practically it looks like we need code_ not frame and any number of frames does not change ops stack (code_). Other thing I observed that code_ does not depend on func_name, may be it should, it is not threadsafe just now.\r\n2. It was implemented for CPU, I plan to check GPU specifics.\r\n3. It seems that tensor(s) is(are) allocated over storage with prepared memory. It means that skipped AllocTensor and AllocADT can keep memory in RAM, it is not good thing but it generates questions about scenarios and VM flexibility.\r\n4. Possibly CI tests are needed to cover some base scenarios\r\n\r\nHello @altanh and @mbs-octoml!

and ldmatrix intrinsics were respectively added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9909 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10855, this PR enables using them together in a TIR schedule. I think this is a very cool example of using `transform_layout + tensorize` together to target very low-level instructions.\r\n\r\nWriting many variants of intrinsic descriptions and their tensorized implemenations (different shape, data type, transposed or not etc) was very tedious, but still it was reasonably manageable thanks to recent improvements in TVMScript meta programming - see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11097 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11324 and how they are exploited in `tir/tensor_intrin/cuda.py`. \r\n\r\nOf all the possible variants of MMA + ldmatrix combinations, only 6 of them are supported for now:\r\n* `ldmatrix` always loads 4 8x8 matrices\r\n* Only support 16x8x16 shape (float16) and 16x8x32 shape (int8) for MMA. These shapes are only supported by Ampere, so sm75 (T4) or sm70 (V100) are not supported. Missing variants (16x8x8 or 8x8x4) can be easily added later if desired.\r\n* Since I always load 4 matrices for each of A and B, I issue two MMA calls to fully utilize the loaded matrices and compute 16x16 output tiles (one MMA call consumes only 2 8x8 matrices from B). Operating on 16x16 tiles also makes it easier to port existing schedules using WMMA intrinsics to use MMA + ldmatrix instead.\r\n\r\nThe test case `test_tir_schedule_tensorize_ldmatrix_mma.py` exercises all 6 supported variants. If we set `measure_perf = True`, it reports GFLOPS on 4k inputs. The following is an example output running on RTX 3070. In particular, I also have an equivalent schedule for the `f16f16f32` case using WMMA intrinsic (~38 TFLOPS), MMA + ldmatrix one below is faster (~40 TFLOPS). \r\n\r\n(`trans` means the matrix B is

This patch tries to eliminate some of them.\r\n\r\nMulti instance mode means: call Run() method concurrently from several threads for single instance of DNNLJSONRuntime. \r\n\r\nParticularly changed for multi instance support:\r\n * Do not modify DNNLJSONRuntime fields from Run method. Make it like a \"const\" method.\r\n * Use explicit dnnl scratchpads where it requested.\r\n * Make Intermediate tensors collection individual for each thread.\r\n\r\nOther improvements:\r\n * Zero copy handling of Input/Output tensors\r\n * Use query API to ask DNNL about desired layouts. Prevent from using of unoptimised kernels.\r\n * Automatic injection or reorder primitives if layout doesn't match.\r\n * Support of different data types (int8, uint8, int32). Eliminate all \"fp32\" hardcoded values.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\nIntroduced indirect handling of memory objects. New objects are TensorRequisite and TensorRegistry.   \r\nTensorRequisite - describe sequence of transformation on top of some source tensor.\r\nTensorRegistry - implement matching of TensorRequisite described tensor and real dnnl::memory objects. \r\n\r\nThis concept allows to:\r\n* Decouple primitives arguments and real memory object. Matching of arguments to memory objects happens on demand depending on contexts of execution (thread id, arguments of method Run).\r\n* Don't care about nature of tensor. Constant weights, intermediate tensors and external input/output processed identically.     \r\n\r\nSome pseudo code to demonstrate concept:\r\n```\r\nDLTensor src_mem = {5, 2, 128, 128, 8} // 5D tensor\r\n\r\n// Describe sequence of layout transformation\r\nauto tr = TensorRequisite.AsIs(src_mem, eid);  // 5D\r\ntr = tr.treatAs(\"ABCD8b\");  // 4D\r\ntr = tr.permute({0, 2, 3, 1});  // permute axes NCHW -> NHWC\r\ntr = tr.crop({1, 128, 128, 16}, {0, 0, 0});  // extract first batch\r\ntr = tr.squeeze();\r\n\r\n// register TR\r\nTensorRegistry t_reg;\r\nauto t_id = t_reg.register(tr);\r\n\r\n// Obtain dnnl::memory object inside of method Run()\r\nauto solver = t_reg.makeSolver(ext_io_provider);\r\nauto mem = solver(t_id);\r\n```","created_at":"2022-05-17T18:38:13Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T10:04:12Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T10:04:12Z","merged_at":"2022-06-02T10:04:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbca53d2ab354d7e8bed11fc9e1eae13fbee7730","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11345/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11345/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11345/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ee39484c0b798473b5bf0e745ff5a407641f7c2a","head":{"label":"apeskov:ap/dnnl-tensor-requisite","ref":"ap/dnnl-tensor-requisite","sha":"ee39484c0b798473b5bf0e745ff5a407641f7c2a","user":{"login":"apeskov","id":14873477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODczNDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14873477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov","html_url":"https://github.com/apeskov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317199412,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTcxOTk0MTI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"apeskov/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apeskov","id":14873477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODczNDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14873477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov","html_url":"https://github.com/apeskov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeskov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apeskov/tvm","description":"Open

issue appeared after implementation of handling broadcast axis on dependent eltwise operators in alter op layout.\r\nThe pattern that I had `conv->add` and it happened that the block size was equal to the number of output channels. In one moment during network compilation we got a situation when we have already blocked layout and alter_op_layout is called one more time. During this second invocation the part dedicated for determination of the layout for second input of `add` detects `1` unconditionally as broadcast axis and puts wrong `layout_transform(->NCHW1c)`. This is wrong. In our case 1 was a reminder. Need to take into account block part as well in such cases.\r\n\r\nI believe test `test_alter_layout_blocked_no_broadcast` shows situation clearly. The second test `test_alter_layout_re_blocking_broadcast` is not required on 100% but let's have it as well - it reproduce scenario of re-blocking of axises and verifies that our algos are correct.\r\n\r\n+@lazycal","created_at":"2022-05-17T11:08:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T11:00:08Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T11:00:08Z","merged_at":"2022-05-18T11:00:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"7f1c54f96ae4099c178f45402f3c156a565dedce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/cc3779be69504674a7ca83ad8ecb78b91c203e5e","head":{"label":"Deelvin:amalyshe/aol_elwise_fix","ref":"amalyshe/aol_elwise_fix","sha":"cc3779be69504674a7ca83ad8ecb78b91c203e5e","user":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321290323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjEyOTAzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Deelvin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin/tvm","description":"Open

sets us up to rebuild Docker images and uses them in later stages in the same build. This is not yet enabled (see the commented out code in `DockerBuild.groovy.j2`. If the build is running on `main`, then the images are uploaded to Docker Hub automatically once the run is complete. To avoid landing a complicated infra PR all at once this mostly adds the scaffolding and a follow up PR will: 1. upload images to tlcpack instead of tlcpackstaging 2. dynamically determine the docker image to use based on the latest hash 3. always rebuild docker images if an updated one hasn't been uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius

`no-else-return` check in pylint has some cases where (to me at least) it leads to less readable code.  In the hypothetical example below, I'd prefer to use if/elif/else to indicate that these are three mutually distinct options, each of which results in similar control flow.  However, the no-else-return check requires writing these as separate if statements.  This reads as though each check is independent, inviting the reader to view the if statements in isolation rather than as a joint structure that exhaustively handles all options.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Preferred style\r\ndef sign(x):\r\n    if x > 0:\r\n        return '+'\r\n    elif x < 0:\r\n        return '-'\r\n    else:\r\n        return ''\r\n\r\n# Required by no-else-return check\r\ndef sign(x):\r\n    if x > 0:\r\n        return '+'\r\n    if x < 0:\r\n        return '-'\r\n    return ''\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the if/elif/else style should be used exclusively, but that the style requires by `no-else-return` is not always preferred, and shouldn't be mandated.\n\ncc @Mousius @areusch

came across a use case where being able to call a python function as a sugar to construct AST fragments is extremely handy. \r\n\r\nThe attached test case illustrates two ways of describing the same TVMScript function, one of which is using the proposed syntax sugar. Here, the called function does some complicated index transformation - Calling a function to construct such mapping, rather than spelling them out by hand, significantly cleans up the TVMScript description.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since the index map is just a normal python function, it can also be used in the layout transformation primitive in a schedule:  \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef index_map(i, j):\r\n   # The same index map shared between TVMScript and Python schedule\r\n    return (i // 16, j // 16, *shared_16x16_to_ldmatrix_32x8_layout(i % 16, j % 16) ) \r\n\r\nsch.transform_layout(C_warp, 0, \"read\", index_map)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, we can be sure that tensorize pattern matching will not fail, since the intrinsic description (written in TVMScript) and the schedule are using exactly the same index map. Without this capability, we need to keep the index map used in a schedule and its explicit description in TVMScript always in sync manually. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\n* The outputs of the called function are inlined into the following body, i.e. no variable or let binding is created.\r\n* The called function cannot be arbitrary - it must be a \"pure\" function consuming and producing TIR expressions. In particular, I don't think we can (or should) construct TIR stmt with this approach. Besides index transformation, describing various activations could be a good use case. \r\n\r\n@Hzfengsy @spectrometerHBH @vinx13 @junrushao1994 @Lunderberg @csullivan

comes with global cli configurations which can persist through\r\nout the process. Direct setting these parameters can affect future LLVM codegens.\r\n\r\nWhile an ideal approach is to config compilation pipeline in a way that is\r\nindependent of such global configs, it is hard to do so given the state of LLVM project itself and its passes are being configed.\r\n\r\nTo work around this problem. This PR introduced a helper scope\r\nto set these configurations in RAII style and recover the settings\r\nafter the scope

PR has two main goals.\r\n\r\n* Improve the pytest messages when unit tests are skipped.  When investigating the bug in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11294, reporting the reason why a test is skipped (disabled in `config.cmake`, disabled in `TVM_TEST_TARGETS`, or no device available).\r\n* Distinguish between tests that only require compile-time support from tests that require a physical device.  The existing `@tvm.testing.requires_*` decorators maintain the same semantics, skipping a test unless both compile-time and run-time support are present.  This adds an optional argument to indicate that the test does not require a physical device (e.g. to require cuda library support without requiring a cuda-capable GPU: `@requires_cuda(support_required=\"compile-only\")`\n\ncc @Mousius @areusch

there, the PR propose to represent `tir.RampNode` in buffer access index just as python slice. I believe this could be a more user friendly way for script users on SIMD-based target, since it just mimic usages in various python numerical libraries like numpy.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n`A[T.ramp(0, 1, 1024)]`  => `A[0:1024]`\r\n`A[T.ramp(i*32, 1, 32)]` => `A[i*32:i*32+32]`\r\n`A[T.ramp(i*4, 4, 32)]` => `A[i*4:i*4+128:4]`\r\n\r\nThe syntax sugar is only available for constant stride and lanes. Also please correct me on two points:\r\n- TIR lowering actually do not support vectorized index in non-last axes, but it is not checked by current change.\r\n- `Slice` with non-trivial step is only allowed in buffer indices, we may want to ensure all other usages should check step==1.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao1994 @Hzfengsy @Lunderberg

`NDArray` is being stored as `ObjectRef`, the serializer won't trigger the right path for storage. Under the new serialization mode, we need to be able to leverage the `repr_bytes` mechanism to save `NDArray`.\r\n\r\nThis change is backward compatible -- ndarray saved in previous format will continue to work. And fixes the problem of serialization when `NDArray` is involved as part of `ObjectRef`. In the future, we can consider consolidate the `NDArray` save into the `repr_bytes` and remove the specialization as we evolve to newer versions\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @areusch
