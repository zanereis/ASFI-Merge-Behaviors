Description\r\n\r\nAfter #6046 changes, CloudStack stopped incrementing the number of public IPs an account has allocated when a user acquires a new IP for a guest network, allowing them to allocate more public IPs than their account's limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix the behavior and honor the account's IP address limit. On top of that, the method `updateIpResourceCount` was refactored and renamed to `checkIfIpResourceCountShouldBeUpdated`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nEverything has been tested in a local lab.\r\n\r\nTests related to the public IPs count:\r\n- I acquired a public IP for a guest network and verified that the account's number of allocated public IPs was incremented;\r\n- I acquired a public IP for a VPC and verified that the account's number of allocated public IPs was incremented.\r\n\r\nTests related to the feature that introduced the bug:\r\n- I reserved a public IP and verified that the IP was successfully reserved and the account's number of public IPs incremented;\r\n- I released a reserved public IP and verified that the IP was successfully released and the account's number of public IPs decremented.\r\n- Through the `associateIpAddress` API, I associated a reserved IP to a guest network. Then, I verified that the IP was successfully associated, that its state changed from `Reserved` to `Allocated` and that the account's number of allocated public IPs did not change.\r\n\r\nTests related to `updateIpResourceCount`:\r\n- I added unit tests that passed before refactoring, refactored the function and checked they were still

Description\r\n\r\nAfter a backup is successfully restored in Veeam, CloudStack tries to synchronize the restored VM; however, during the NIC synchronization process, all NIC devices are cast to `VirtualE1000`, whether they are an `E1000` or not, resulting in a casting exception being thrown and the process failing when they are not.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix

restore a backup of a VM that had a network adapter of types `PCNet32`, `Vmxnet2` or `Vmxnet3`, I would receive the following error message:\r\n```\r\n(<vm_name>) Error during vm backup restoration and import: class com.vmware.vim25.VirtualPCNet32 cannot be cast to class com.vmware.vim25.VirtualE1000 (com.vmware.vim25.VirtualPCNet32 and com.vmware.vim25.VirtualE1000 are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these changes, I was able to successfully restore the

makes the KVM guru pass the max memory to KVM agent by picking the max. memory from the VM transfer object. This lets the cluster/agent decide if VM should start with the min or max memory depending on whether vm.memballoon.disable is false (default) or true.\r\n\r\nWhen vm.memballoon.disable is true, VMs start with max. memory. Right now the max memory isn't sent to the KVM agent causing the regression.

cap limitation was enabled as part of\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6420 that changes behaviour for existing environments.\r\n\r\nThe CPU cap limitation on KVM causes systemvms to not start or be really slow in nested and virtualised environments.

By setting the value to false, no cpu share/limitation was put on new SSVMs and they could start and work. On git history check, found this to be a recent change introduced between 4.17->4.18 via #6420. This should be

makes the KVM guru pass the max memory to KVM agent by picking the max. memory from the VM transfer object. This lets the cluster/agent decide if VM should start with the min or max memory depending on whether vm.memballoon.disable is false (default) or true.\r\n\r\nWhen `vm.memballoon.disable` is true, VMs start with max. memory. Right now the max memory isn't sent to the KVM agent causing the regression.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n1) Sets disk format correctly according to thin/thick provisioned PowerFlex volumes when encryption is in play. It delegates the volume format to the implementation (ScaleIOStorageAdaptor) and ensures it is passed back so it is stored properly in the VolumeVO. \r\n\r\nThis allows us to trigger the code that resizes the qcow2 container if we are thin provisioned - this wasn't working for data volumes when VM was stopped because they were hard coded to RAW format.\r\n\r\n2) Defensive coding in case volume has no VM instance name (detached)\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n1) Sets disk format correctly according to thin/thick provisioned PowerFlex volumes when encryption is in play. It delegates the volume format to the implementation (ScaleIOStorageAdaptor) and ensures it is passed back so it is stored properly in the VolumeVO. \r\n\r\nThis allows us to trigger the code that resizes the qcow2 container if we are thin provisioned - this wasn't working for data volumes when VM was stopped because they were hard coded to RAW format.\r\n\r\n2) Defensive coding in case volume has no VM instance name (detached)\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nDuring deployment, ACS creates a Root CA and stores it in the database. From this Root CA, ACS generates a self-signed certificate for the management servers and other components. The MS certificate is stored in memory and is generated every time the MS is restarted.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the MS adds as alternative name only the IP of its default network, therefore, if the network used for communication between the MSs is different from their default network, the certificate will never be accepted and the communication will not take place.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the MS's IP in the `management.network.cidr` network as an alternative name in the self-signed certificate. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nWith `ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness` turned on and `management.network.cidr` configured to the MGMT network. I changed the default network in one of my env's MS and restarted ACS. \r\nWithout this PR's changes, handshake errors between MSs started to show in the logs. \r\n```\r\n2023-07-06 14:23:48,647 DEBUG

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses rare cases of potential overlap of resource reservation and resource count.

PR - https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/334\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request (PR) implements a Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) for a CloudStack cluster. The primary objective of this feature is to enable automatic resource optimization and workload balancing within the cluster by live migrating the VMs as per configuration.\r\nAdministrators can also execute DRS manually for a cluster, using the UI or the API.\r\nAdds support for two algorithms - `condensed` & `balanced`. Algorithms are pluggable allowing ACS Administrators to have customized control over scheduling.\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\nThere are three top level components:\r\n\r\n1. **Scheduler**\r\nA timer task which:\r\n* Generate DRS plan for clusters\r\n* Process DRS plan\r\n* Remove old DRS plan records\r\n\r\n2. **DRS Execution**\r\nWe go through each VM in the cluster and use the specified algorithm to check if DRS is required and to calculate `cost`, `benefit` & `improvement` of migrating that VM to another host in the cluster. On the basis of `cost`, `benefit` & `improvement`, the best migration is selected for the current iteration and the VM is migrated. The maximum number of iterations (live migrations) possible on the cluster is defined by `drs.iterations` which is defined as a percentage (as a value between 0 and 1) of total number of workloads.\r\n\r\n3. **Algorithm** \r\nEvery algorithms implements two methods: \r\n    1.  `needsDrs` - to check if drs is required for cluster\r\n    2.  `getMetrics` - to calculate `cost`, `benefit` & `improvement` of a migrating a VM to another host.\r\n\r\n**Algorithms**\r\n1. `Condensed` - Packs all the VMs on minimum number of hosts in the cluster.\r\n2. `Balanced` - Distributes the VMs evenly across hosts in the cluster. \r\nAlgorithms use `drs.level` to decide the amount of imbalance to allow in the cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### APIs Added\r\n_listClusterDrsPlan_\r\n> `id` - ID of the DRS plan to list\r\n> `clusterid` - to list plans for a cluster id\r\n\r\n_generateClusterDrsPlan_\r\n>`id` - cluster id\r\n>`iterations` - The maximum number of iterations in a DRS job defined as a percentage (as a value between 0 and 1) of total number of workloads. Defaults to value of cluster's `drs.iterations` setting.\r\n\r\n_executeClusterDrsPlan_\r\n> `id` - ID of the cluster for which DRS plan is to be executed.\r\n> `migrateto` - This parameter specifies the mapping between a vm and a host to migrate that VM.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to create a raw L2 network within an advanced zone with security groups enabled.\r\nIt is expected that Cloudstack does not have any control over the security in an L2 network, by the definition itself of such network.\r\n\r\nThe fact that security groups are enabled or disabled should not be a blocker for L2 networks. Especially as these L2 can be useful when used as secondary networks (with no services) in a zone with existing shared networks protected by security groups.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't add a new feature per se, but rather prevent cloudstack from blocking the creation of L2 networks.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

PR adds supports to cloudstack for managing and unmanaging VM's in KVM Hypervisor. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses  #7127\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe support is extended through API's and also the UI. The Apache Cloudstack  KVM plugin has been extended with new command wrappers for fetching unmanaged VM's xml attribute. The code paths in management server have been cleaned up and refined for managing KVM specific importing commands.\r\nAPI's involved are :\r\n\r\n- unmanageVirtualmachine\r\n- listunmanageInstances\r\n- importVirtualMachine\r\n\r\n### Testing steps:\r\n\r\n- Build pull request and deploy a new apache cloudstack environment with KVM hosts(used monkeybox for local development and testing).\r\n- From the cloudstack UI, create a new virtual machine.\r\n- Go to tools option and choose import-export instances.\r\n- In the managed instance section, see if the newly created virtual machine exist.\r\n- From the managed instance section, choose the virtual machine and unmanaged it.\r\n- Once the VM is unmanaged you can see it disappear from manage instance section and it will appear in unmanage instance section.\r\n- To manage an unmanage instance, choose an instance from unmanage instance section.\r\n- On click of unmanage  instance a popup will appear, where you need to enter vm name and choose vm template, service offering, network and then click import instance button.\r\n- You can see the unmanage instance is managed now and you can see it populate in the mananged instance section under import-export instances section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features,

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the case [testCRUDAcl](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/6125886f3d0b64ff3d0a743d00bf414774e7e2e3/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/test/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraNvpApiIT.java#L107).\r\n\r\nFix #6665 \r\n\r\n- Extracted shared ACL setup logic into a private helper method, setupAcl().\r\n- Split original testCRUDAcl into two separate tests: testCRUDAclReadAll and testCRUDAclReadOne.\r\n- Each test case now represents a unique scenario for better readability and maintainability.\r\n- Replaced assertTrue(false) with fail() in catch blocks for better test failure indication.\r\n\r\nThese changes aim to enhance the clarity and maintainability of the test suite, and ensure each test case checks only one scenario.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nWhen deploying a VM is failed during the allocation process it may leave the resources that have been already allocated before the failure. They will get removed from the database as the whole code block is wrapped inside a transaction twice but the server would not inform the network or storage plugins to clean up the allocated resources. This PR removes Transactions during VM allocation which results in the allocated VM and its resource records being persisted in DB even during failures. When failure is encountered VM is moved to Error state. This helps VM and its resources to be properly deallocated when it is expunged either by a server task such as ExpungeTask or during manual expunge.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking

Description\r\n\r\nDesign document: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/%5BDRAFT%5D+Minimal+changes+to+allow+new+dynamic+hypervisor+type%3A+Custom+Hypervisor\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the minimal changes to add a new hypervisor type (internally named Custom in the codebase, and configurable display name), allowing to write an external hypervisor plugin as a Custom Hypervisor to CloudStack\r\n\r\nThe custom hypervisor name is set by the setting: 'hypervisor.custom.display.name'. The new hypervisor type does not affect the behaviour of any CloudStack operation, it simply introduces a new hypervisor type into the system.\r\n\r\nCloudStack does not have any means to dynamically add new hypervisor types. The hypervisor types are internally preset by an enum defined within the CloudStack codebase and unless a new version supports a new hypervisor it is not possible to add a host of a hypervisor that is not in part of the enum. It is possible to implement minimal changes in CloudStack to support a new hypervisor plugin that may be developed privately\r\n\r\nThis PR is an initial work on allowing new dynamic hypervisor types (adds a new element to the HypervisorType enum, but allows variable display name for the hypervisor)\r\n\r\n##### Proposed Future work:\r\nReplace the HypervisorType from a fixed enum to an extensible registry mechanism, registered from the hypervisor plugin\r\n\r\n#### Feature Specifications\r\n- The new hypervisor type is internally named 'Custom' to the CloudStack services (management server and agent services, database records).\r\n- A new global setting ‘hypervisor.custom.display.name’ allows administrators to set the display name of the hypervisor type. The display name will be shown in the CloudStack UI and API.\r\n   - In case the ‘hypervisor.list’ setting contains the display name of the new hypervisor type, the setting value is automatically updated after the ‘hypervisor.custom.display.name’ setting is updated.\r\n- The new Custom hypervisor type supports:\r\n   - Direct downloads (the ability to download templates into primary storage from the hypervisor hosts without using secondary storage)\r\n   - Local storage (use hypervisor hosts local storage as primary storage)\r\n   - Template format: RAW format (the templates to be registered on the new hypervisor type must be in RAW format)\r\n- The UI is also extended to display the new hypervisor type and the supported features listed above.\r\n- The above are the minimal changes for CloudStack to support the new hypervisor type, which can be tested by integrating the plugin codebase with this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Use cases\r\nThis PR allows the cloud administrators to test custom hypervisor plugins implementations in CloudStack and easily integrate it into CloudStack as a new hypervisor type (\"Custom\"), reducing the implementation to only the hypervisor supported specific storage/networking and the hypervisor resource to communicate with the management server.\r\n\r\n- CloudStack admin should be able to create a zone for the new custom hypervisor and add clusters, hosts into the zone with normal operations\r\n- CloudStack users should be able to execute normal VMs/volumes/network/storage operations on VMs/volumes running on the custom hypervisor hosts\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nHaving set 'hypervisor.custom.display.name' = 'MyCustomHW', added an extra zone with the hypervisor type 'MyCustomHW' and added one host:\r\n\r\n- Listing hosts, one per zone. The hypervisor type is set as the display name of the custom hypervisor\r\n<img width=\"1124\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-06 at 10 38 56\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/5295080/28d96b1f-9506-494b-a0ba-dba2957c8727\">\r\n\r\n- Listing hosts in database.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an intermittent issue where SDC id (local_path) is getting deleted and not getting populated when host connects back again.\r\n\r\nFix is to remove the code to delete the records from storage_pool_host_ref table. We are anyways updating the entry if the SDC ID is changed during agent restart which is anyways required inorder to get the new connections. I've quickly verified the host delete scenario to check the storage_pool_host_ref entries behavior, entries are getting deleted.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nFixes case of account/domain having negative storage count when there is a volume size difference while deploying volumes on certain stroages. In case of Powerflex volume size results in a multiple of 8. If user deploys a volume of 12GB it will result in 16GB in size. But currently CloudStack will not update resource count after deployment.\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR bypasses overprovisioning settings on memory for SSVMs to make sure these can always start.\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR adds autodeflate to memballoon on KVM VMs and sets the memory to `memory` instead of `currentMemory`. It implement sugestions by @rajujith at https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/7430#issuecomment-1600245780. This solution seems not to fixs overprovisioning issues in VMs and a new PR will have to be created for a definite solution on that.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has
