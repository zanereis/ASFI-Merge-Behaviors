PR implements a first part of [KIP-841](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-841%3A+Fenced+replicas+should+not+be+allowed+to+join+the+ISR+in+KRaft). Specifically, it implements the following:\r\n* Adds a new metadata version.\r\n* Adds the InControlledShutdown field to the BrokerRegistrationRecord and BrokerRegistrationChangeRecord and bump their versions. The newest versions are only used if the new metadata version is enabled.\r\n* Writes a BrokerRegistrationChangeRecord with InControlledShutdown set when a broker requests a controlled shutdown.\r\n* Ensures that fenced and in controlled shutdown replicas are not picked as leaders nor included in the ISR.\r\n* Adds or extends unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe second half (the AlterPartition part) is implemented in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12181.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

detailed description of your change*\r\nWill will generate NoOpRecord periodically to increase metadata LEO, however, when a broker startup, we will wait until its metadata LEO catches up with the controller LEO, we generate NoOpRecord every 500ms and send heartbeat request every 2000ms. \r\n\r\nIt's almost impossible for a broker to catch up with the controller LEO if the broker sends a query request every 2000ms but the controller LEO increases every 500ms, so the tests in `KRaftClusterTest` will

1. I wonder if it's necessary to include support for type casting with this\r\n> SMT. We already have a Cast SMT (\r\n> https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/transforms/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/transforms/Cast.java)\r\n> that can parse multiple fields of a structured record value with differing\r\n> types. Would it be enough for your new SMT to only produce string values\r\n> for its structured data, and then allow users to perform casting logic\r\n> using the Cast SMT afterward?\r\n\r\n> 2. It seems like the \"struct.field\" property is similar; based on the\r\n> examples, it looks like when the SMT is configured with a value for that\r\n> property, it will first pull out a field from a structured record value\r\n> (for example, it would pull out the value \"\r\n> https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect\" from a map of {\"url\": \"\r\n> https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect\"}), then parse that field's\r\n> value, and replace the entire record value (or key) with the result of the\r\n> parsing stage. It seems like this could be accomplished using the\r\n> ExtractField SMT (\r\n> https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/transforms/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/transforms/ExtractField.java)\r\n> as a preliminary step before passing it to your new SMT. Is this correct?\r\n> And if so, could we simplify the interface for your SMT by removing the\r\n> \"struct.field\" property in favor of the existing ExtractField SMT?\r\n\r\n1.

patch rearranges some code to remove the FinalizedFeatureCache and replace it with MetadataCache. Since features are included in the MetadataImage in KRaft mode (where feature flags are actually used), it makes sense to expose them through MetadataCache.\r\n\r\nOne catch was that the ZK controller needed access to the feature flags cache and I didn't want to pass MetadataCache into KafkaController. For this case I pulled out an interface of the two accessors the controller used.\r\n\r\nThis patch also adds a MetadataVersion getter on the MetadataCache

PR fixes a bug where FeatureControlManager#replay(FeatureLevelRecord) was throwing an\r\nexception if not all controllers in the quorum supported the feature being applied. While we do\r\nwant to validate this, it needs to be validated earlier, before the record is committed to the log.\r\nOnce the record has been committed to the log it should always be applied if the current controller\r\nsupports it.\r\n\r\nFix another bug where removing a feature was not supported once it had been configured. Note that\r\nbecause we reserve feature level 0 for \"feature not enabled\", we don't need to use\r\nOptional<VersionRange>; we can just return a range of 0-0 when the feature is not supported.\r\n\r\nIn error messages, give more detail about what the problem is when a controller in the quorum cannot\r\nhandle a new version. For example, \"Local controller 0 does not support this feature\" rather than just\r\n\"quorum does not support this feature\".\r\n\r\nAllow the metadata version to be downgraded when UpgradeType.UNSAFE_DOWNGRADE has been set.\r\nPreviously we were unconditionally denying this even when this was set.\r\n\r\nAdd a builder for FeatureControlManager, so that we can easily add new parameters to the\r\nconstructor in the future. This will also be useful for creating FeatureControlManagers that are\r\ninitialized to a specific MetadataVersion.","created_at":"2022-05-24T23:46:15Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T23:09:44Z","closed_at":"2022-06-01T23:09:38Z","merged_at":"2022-06-01T23:09:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ca9cd4d2d2a89510dbe357783a316f2f0789799","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5f3ffad6bf86a8a4478f599ef2a2f28c74cd0773","head":{"label":"cmccabe:feature-control-manager-fixes","ref":"feature-control-manager-fixes","sha":"5f3ffad6bf86a8a4478f599ef2a2f28c74cd0773","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

an initial step to address the notoriously flaky `BlockingConnectorTest` test suite, we can try increasing test timeouts.\r\n\r\nThis approach may not be sufficient, and even if it is, it's still suboptimal. Although it may address flakiness on Jenkins, it will make genuine failures harder to detect when testing local changes. Additionally, if the workload on Jenkins continues to increase, we'll probably have to bump these timeouts in the future again at some point.\r\n\r\nPotential next steps, for this PR and beyond:\r\n1. Stop leaking threads that block during test runs\r\n2. Instead of artificially reducing the REST request timeout at the beginning of every test, reduce it selectively right before issuing a REST request that is expected to time out, and then immediately reset it.\r\n3. Eliminate artificial reduction of the REST request timeout entirely, as it may be negatively impacting other Connect integration tests that are being run concurrently.\r\n4. Test repeatedly on Jenkins, ideally at least 50 times\r\n5. Gather information on the number of CPU cores available to each Jenkins node and the distribution of how many threads are allocated over a given time period (maybe a day?); this is especially relevant since local testing indicates that these tests all do much better when parallelism is reduced, which shouldn't be too surprising considering that each Connect integration test spins up separate threads for at least one Zookeeper node, one Kafka broker, one Connect worker, and usually at least one connector and one task.\r\n\r\nI'd like to test these changes as a first step before investigating any of the above (except maybe items 1 and 2, which should be fairly straightforward). To trigger new runs I plan on pushing empty commits or, if those do not trigger new Jenkins runs, dummy commits. If this is objectionable let me know and hopefully we can find a suitable alternative.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation\r\n- [ ]

the kraft broker begins controlled shutdown, it immediately disables the metadata listener. This means that metadata changes as part of the controlled shutdown do not get sent to the respective components. For partitions that the broker is follower of, that is what we want. It prevents the follower from being able to rejoin the ISR while still shutting down. But for partitions that the broker is leading, it means the leader will remain active until controlled shutdown finishes and the socket server is stopped. That delay can be as much as 5 seconds and probably even worse.\r\n\r\nThis PR revises the controlled shutdown procedure as follow:\r\n* The broker signals to the replica manager that it is about to start the controlled shutdown.\r\n* The broker requests a controlled shutdown to the controller.\r\n* The controller moves leaders off from the broker, removes the broker from any ISR that it is a member of, and writes those changes to the metadata log.\r\n* When the broker receives a partition metadata change, it looks if it is in the ISR. If it is, it updates the partition as usual. If it is not, it stops the fetcher/replica. This basically stops all the partitions for which the broker was part of their ISR.\r\n\r\nWhen the broker is a replica of a partition but it is not in the ISR, the controller does not do anything. The leader epoch is not bumped. In this particular case, the follower will continue to run until the replica manager shuts down. In this time, the replica could become in-sync and the leader could try to bring it back to the ISR. We rely on https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12181 to ensure that does not happen.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

Problem\r\nImplementation of connection creation rate quotas in Kafka is dependent on two configurations:\r\n[quota.window.num](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs_quota.window.num) AND [quota.window.size.seconds](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs_quota.window.size.seconds)\r\n\r\nThe minimum possible values of these configuration is 1 as per the documentation. However, when we set 1 as the configuration value, we can hit a situation where rate is calculated as NaN (and hence, leads to exceptions). This specific scenario occurs when an event is recorded at the start of a sample window.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThis patch fixes this edge case by ensuring that the windowSize over which Rate is calculated is at least 1ms (even if it is calculated at the start of the sample window).\r\n\r\n## Test\r\nAdded a unit test which fails before the patch and passes after the patch\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Public Changes\r\n1. A new configuration flag metadata.max.idle.interval.ms\r\n2. A new metrics group \"broker-metadata-metrics\" to the brokers\r\n3. Four new metrics to the KafkaController metric group\r\n4. Increase the IBP and metadata.version\r\n5. A new metadata  record called NoOpRecord which is only written if we have a matching metadata version\r\n\r\n### Implementation Changes\r\nThe KRaft controller schedules an event to write NoOpRecord to the metadata log if the metadata version supports this feature. This event is scheduled at the interval defined in metadata.max.idle.interval.ms. Brokers and controllers were improved to ignore the NoOpRecord when replaying the metadata log.\r\n\r\nThe replica control manager was also changed to accept a metadata version supplier to determine if leader recovery state is supported.\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\nFixed a bug where metadata version 3.3-IV1 was not marked as changing the metadata.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-19T17:27:10Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T17:48:49Z","closed_at":"2022-06-01T17:48:24Z","merged_at":"2022-06-01T17:48:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d1b0926fab104311a505826831ddc45864e9a6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5e43b7ed15035012a54a43e8231fb364bbd6b806","head":{"label":"jsancio:kafka-13883-monitor-quorum","ref":"kafka-13883-monitor-quorum","sha":"5e43b7ed15035012a54a43e8231fb364bbd6b806","user":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169502372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjk1MDIzNzI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"jsancio/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio/kafka","description":"Mirror

If we are downgrading from 3.2 to 3.0, the downgrade of the feature flag will cause the active controller to stop populating this field, but the value will still be present in existing records.

Specifically, it implements the following:\r\n* It introduces INELIGIBLE_REPLICA and NEW_LEADER_ELECTED error codes.\r\n* The KRaft controller validates the new ISR provided in the AlterPartition request and rejects the call if any replica in the new ISR is not eligible to join the the ISR - e.g. when fenced or shutting down. The leader reverts to the last committed ISR when its request is rejected due to this.\r\n* The partition leader also verifies that a replica is not fenced before trying to add it back to the ISR. If it is not eligible, the ISR expansion is not triggered at all.\r\n* Updates the AlterPartition API to use topic ids. Updates the AlterPartition manger to handle topic names/ids. Updates the ZK controller and the KRaft controller to handle topic names/ids depending on the version of the request used.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

remain connected and able to produce or consume despite an expired OAUTHBEARER token.\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced using the https://github.com/acsaki/kafka-sasl-reauth project by starting the embedded OAuth2 server and Kafka, then running the long running consumer in OAuthBearerTest and then killing the OAuth2 server thus making the client unable to re-authenticate.\r\n\r\nRoot cause seems to be SaslServerAuthenticator#calcCompletionTimesAndReturnSessionLifetimeMs failing to set ReauthInfo#sessionExpirationTimeNanos when tokens have already expired (when session life time goes negative), in turn causing KafkaChannel#serverAuthenticationSessionExpired returning false and finally SocketServer not closing the channel.\r\n\r\nThe issue is observed with OAUTHBEARER but seems to

The current timeout behavior in a heartbeat request is to just keep retrying — which generally makes sense, just not in the context of a controlled shutdown.\r\n\r\nWhen a heartbeat request times out, if we are in the middle of a controlled shutdown, we shouldn't just retry forever but rather just give up on trying to contact the controller and proceed with the controlled shutdown.\r\n\r\n[1]

the AlterConfigs/IncrementalAlterConfigs zk handler, we return `INVALID_REQUEST` and `INVALID_CONFIG` inconsistently. The problem is in `LogConfig.validate`. We may either return `ConfigException` or `InvalidConfigException`. When the first of these is thrown, we catch it and convert to `INVALID_REQUEST`. If the latter is thrown, then we return `INVALID_CONFIG`. It seems more appropriate to return `INVALID_CONFIG` consistently.

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13889\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Fixes `AclsDelta` to handle `ACCESS_CONTROL_ENTRY_RECORD` quickly followed by `REMOVE_ACCESS_CONTROL_ENTRY_RECORD` for same ACL\r\n- As explained in the JIRA, in https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/image/AclsDelta.java#L64 we store the pending deletion in the `changes` Map. This could override a creation that might have just happened. This is an issue because in `BrokerMetadataPublisher` this results in us making a `removeAcl` call which finally results in https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/metadata/authorizer/StandardAuthorizerData.java#L203 being executed and this code throws an exception if the ACL isnt in the Map yet. If the `ACCESS_CONTROL_ENTRY_RECORD` event never got processed by `BrokerMetadataPublisher` then the ACL wont be in the Map yet.\r\n- So the fix here is to remove the entry from the `changes` Map if the ACL doesnt exist in the image yet. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added unit tests for new behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-13T17:18:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T23:24:34Z","closed_at":"2022-05-19T23:24:34Z","merged_at":"2022-05-19T23:24:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8e3a259e5d4daf098a503a25aa6249e21ba557a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/86e62aa27cf4cf059baa445b379c8026f4f4dff7","head":{"label":"andymg3:KAFKA-13889","ref":"KAFKA-13889","sha":"86e62aa27cf4cf059baa445b379c8026f4f4dff7","user":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":475882650,"node_id":"R_kgDOHF1kmg","name":"kafka","full_name":"andymg3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3/kafka","description":"Mirror

a partition leader receives a `Fetch` request from a replica which is not in the current replica set, the behavior today is to return a successful fetch response, but with empty data. This causes the follower to retry until metadata converges without updating any state on the leader side. It is clearer in this case to return an error, so that the metadata inconsistency is visible in logging and so that the follower backs off before retrying. \r\n\r\nThe question then is what error to return? In this patch, we use `UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH` when the `Fetch` request includes the current leader epoch. The way I see this is that the leader is validating the (replicaId, leaderEpoch) tuple. When the leader returns `UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH`, it means that the leader does not expect the given leaderEpoch from that replica. If the request does not include a leader epoch, then we use `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER`. We can squint our eyes a little and take a similar interpretation for this case: the leader is rejecting the request because it does not think it should be the leader for that replica. But mainly these errors ensure that the follower will retry the request.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this patch, I have refactored the way that the leader updates follower fetch state. Previously, the process is slightly convoluted. We send the fetch from `ReplicaManager` down to `Partition.readRecords`, then we iterate over the results and call `Partition.updateFollowerFetchState`. It is more straightforward to update state directly as a part of `readRecords`. All we need to do is pass through the `FetchParams`. This also prevents an unnecessary copy of the read results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13892\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/controller/AclControlManager.java#L143 we loop through the ACL filters and and add `RemoveAccessControlEntryRecord` records to the response list for each matching ACL. There's a bug where if two (or more) filters match the same ACL, we create two (or more) `RemoveAccessControlEntryRecord` records for the same ACL. This is an issue because upon replay we throw an exception (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/controller/AclControlManager.java#L195) if the ACL is not in the in-memory data structures which will happen to the second `RemoveAccessControlEntryRecord`.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to dedupe `List<AclDeleteResult>`. It contains a list of results, where each result contains the ACLs that matched the filter. It should be OK for the same ACL to be in multiple AclDeleteResult results because it really could match multiple filters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added a unit test that tests the new behavior\r\n- Ran pre-existing `AclControlManager` tests:\r\n```\r\n kafka % ./gradlew metadata:test --tests org.apache.kafka.controller.AclControlManagerTest --rerun-tasks\r\n\r\n> Configure project
