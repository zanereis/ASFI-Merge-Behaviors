now a `Range` could only step by an integer value, even if its elements had other types, e.g. doubles.\nThis made stepping over ranges like `0.1..0.9`strange, as that resulted in a single element.\n\nAlso, stepping over `ObjectRange` instances (like the above one) called the `next`/`previous` method reflectively, even if the range had a numeric type (the most common case).\nThis made it ~10x slower than e.g. `IntRange`.\n\nThe new implementation changed the `step` type to `Number` and unified the way stepping is done in\n`ObjectRange` and `IntRange`, making them as fast as the original `IntRange` for numeric cases.\n\nAlso, `IntRange` treats the overflow issue by storing the intermediary value in a `Long` directly.\n\nAt the boundaries, the `next` and `previous` methods may now wrap to the other extreme - or return null.\n\n---\n\nI tested the speed via the following trivial method:\n\n``` Groovy\nvoid testSpeed() {\n    for (def i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n        run()\n}\n\nprivate void run() {\n    def time = System.currentTimeMillis()\n    def size = 0G\n    for (def i = 0; i < 100; i++) { // changed to `i = 0G` when testing ObjectRange\n        for (def j = 0; j < 100; j++) {\n            def range = i..j\n            def inverseRange = j..i\n            for (def k = 1; k < 100; k++) {\n                size += range.step(k).size()\n                size += range.step(-k).size()\n\n                size += inverseRange.step(k).size()\n                size += inverseRange.step(-k).size()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    println \"size = ${size} in ${(System.currentTimeMillis() - time) / 1000.0}s\"\n}\n```\n\nresulting in\n\n```\n* Old impl for ObjectRange: `66.30s`\n* New impl for ObjectRange: `5.52s` (12x faster)\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n* Old impl for IntRange: `4.54s`\n* New impl for IntRange: `4.52s` (same speed as before)\n```\n","created_at":"2015-09-17T20:36:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T19:31:02Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T16:28:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"555fe135601607e6bcf1f80f81dcd8df060bd2b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/bcaa3acd5a84eae9a80d789189dabc148610a5ec","head":{"label":"l0rinc:RangeNumberStepSize","ref":"RangeNumberStepSize","sha":"bcaa3acd5a84eae9a80d789189dabc148610a5ec","user":{"login":"l0rinc","id":1841944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDE5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc","html_url":"https://github.com/l0rinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41491197,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTQ5MTE5Nw==","name":"incubator-groovy","full_name":"l0rinc/incubator-groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"l0rinc","id":1841944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDE5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc","html_url":"https://github.com/l0rinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/l0rinc/incubator-groovy","description":"Mirror

PR allows to grab Grapes via a new `:grab` command. Classes from the new jar are available ia the import command completion. \n\nTo allow the completion to work, I had to change the selection of the classLoader in GrapeIvy. I do not know if that will break anything. Grabbing without completion is already possible in groovysh in a cumbersome way using the grapes code API. Merely adding a command to hide that would also be nice, but the real benefit would be to have import completion, as manually typing import commands is very tiring.\n","created_at":"2015-08-28T11:29:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T18:29:24Z","closed_at":"2016-05-09T18:29:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c063d95b59b42d50876b17b287158f35772f20d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/14ebcae27d584769067b989c92651c41a19d29b4","head":{"label":"tkruse:groovysh-grab","ref":"groovysh-grab","sha":"14ebcae27d584769067b989c92651c41a19d29b4","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"83891b6dc09be0a40ce1ce7cb2a48f2524ac43e1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

fail.\n","created_at":"2015-08-26T00:54:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T03:46:43Z","closed_at":"2015-09-01T18:39:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dca54c83f1ad9638eae36bfef8d7aae8558f0dd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/7c57dbc5ec75652b530541228cd3c861eb696469","head":{"label":"tkruse:fix-groovysh-import","ref":"fix-groovysh-import","sha":"7c57dbc5ec75652b530541228cd3c861eb696469","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e5acbaa16483e348306abc7db683657b4ac157d7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

are some refactorings and minor enhancements of the formatting methods in InvokerHelper.\n\nThe formatting of maps, arrays, collections and ranges should be more consistent, allowing the same parameters (verbose, maxSize, safe) everywhere. The 'safe' parameter gets used in many more contexts (though default is still false).\n\nI hope that existing behavior and API was not changed (too much). I believe I did not change any existing _public_ method signature, though I added a few with more options.\n\nThe behavior should be the same, except for the case when an Object.toString() method throws a checked exception, then this will be rethrown wrapped in a GroovyRuntimeException, when a method is invoked with 'safe=true', which I believe is done by PowerAsserts.\n\nSome changes might need further discussions. One thing annoying me still is that after this PR, the methods\n`toArrayString(Object[] collection, boolean verbose, int maxSize, boolean safe)` and `formatCollection(Collection collection, boolean verbose, int maxSize, boolean safe)` are syntactically equal, not sure if there is a nice way not to replicate code, yet also not transforming arrays to collections or vice versa.\n\nThe preAllocation of the StringBuffers might be too big, maybe a value like 3 or 4 might be nicer. It's always a heuristic value, maybe premature optimization.\n\nI hope next to change the default printing in PowerAsserts and Groovysh to use the \"verbose\" flag.\n","created_at":"2015-08-21T18:38:02Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T13:43:08Z","closed_at":"2016-07-28T12:42:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b36b1fe77605deb30db475f0bd5dfe7129cf8e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/96/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/96/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/96/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/0ebc0e3e408ea3349f455cce69f47e2b6e93106c","head":{"label":"tkruse:refactor-invoker","ref":"refactor-invoker","sha":"0ebc0e3e408ea3349f455cce69f47e2b6e93106c","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d6252c31ebc2caf98d546af2bdfd45aa53166085","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

PR contains multiple minor fixes for tab completion in groovysh. I detected those while working on upgrading to jline 2.13. The main fix is for completion of files or folders with blanks or hyphens in the name. The previous implementation tried to juggle with opening and closing hyphens, but this caused several bugs.\n\nAside from this, I changed a bit the handling of blanks, such that completion of a command without arguments (like `:exit`) is not completed with a blank at the end, suggesting more arguments are

@melix,\n\nI guess I have understood the problem for this issue (kindly correct me if I'm wrong here). Looks like there is no method to handle `rightShiftUnsigned` operation for writing the bytecode in the compile static mode. Actually there is no methods for other bitwise operations as well; After this fix, I have tested the code with and without `@CompileStatic`. Then did `groovyc`, could able to see the the difference in the generated byte code. \n\nSample program that I have used, (same as given in the issue):\n\n```\nimport groovy.transform.CompileStatic \n\ntest()\n\n@CompileStatic\ndef test() {\n  long register = 0xfac432b10cd5e44aL  \n\n  [1,2,3].each { int element -> \n    int t = (int) (register >>> 56 ^ (long) element) & 0xff\n    println t\n  }  \n}\n```\n\ndoing `javap` on the compiled groovy class, I could able to get \n\n```\n  public java.lang.Object test();\n    Code:\n       0: getstatic     #59                 // Field $const$0:J\n       3: invokestatic  #65                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;\n       6: new           #67                 // class groovy/lang/Reference\n       9: dup_x1        \n      10: swap          \n      11: invokespecial #70                 // Method groovy/lang/Reference.\"<init>\":(Ljava/lang/Object;)V\n      14: astore_1      \n      15: aload_1       \n      16: pop           \n      17: iconst_3      \n      18: anewarray     #72                 // class java/lang/Object\n      21: dup           \n      22: iconst_0      \n      23: iconst_1      \n      24: invokestatic  #77                 // Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;\n      27: aastore       \n      28: dup           \n      29: iconst_1      \n      30: iconst_2      \n      31: invokestatic  #77                 // Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;\n      34: aastore       \n      35: dup           \n      36: iconst_2      \n      37: iconst_3      \n      38: invokestatic  #77                 // Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;\n      41: aastore       \n      42: invokestatic  #83                 // Method org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/ScriptBytecodeAdapter.createList:([Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/util/List;\n      45: new           #85                 // class \"GROOVY-7542$_test_closure1\"\n      48: dup           \n      49: aload_0       \n      50: aload_0       \n      51: aload_1       \n      52: invokespecial #88                 // Method \"GROOVY-7542$_test_closure1\".\"<init>\":(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Lgroovy/lang/Reference;)V\n      55: invokestatic  #94                 // Method org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/DefaultGroovyMethods.each:(Ljava/util/List;Lgroovy/lang/Closure;)Ljava/util/List;\n      58: areturn       \n      59: aconst_null   \n      60: areturn      \n```\n\n(only for `test` method)\n\nwhere as removing the `@CompileStatic` does gives the following bytecode:\n\n```\npublic java.lang.Object test();\n    Code:\n       0: invokestatic  #19                 // Method $getCallSiteArray:()[Lorg/codehaus/groovy/runtime/callsite/CallSite;\n       3: astore_1      \n       4: getstatic     #59                 // Field $const$0:J\n       7: invokestatic  #65                 // Method java/lang/Long.valueOf:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;\n      10: new           #67                 // class groovy/lang/Reference\n      13: dup_x1        \n      14: swap          \n      15: invokespecial #70                 // Method groovy/lang/Reference.\"<init>\":(Ljava/lang/Object;)V\n      18: astore_2      \n      19: aload_2       \n      20: pop           \n      21: aload_1       \n      22: ldc           #71                 // int 2\n      24: aaload        \n      25: iconst_3      \n      26: anewarray     #73                 // class java/lang/Object\n      29: dup           \n      30: iconst_0      \n      31: iconst_1      \n      32: invokestatic  #78                 // Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;\n      35: aastore       \n      36: dup           \n      37: iconst_1      \n      38: iconst_2      \n      39: invokestatic  #78                 // Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;\n      42: aastore       \n      43: dup           \n      44: iconst_2      \n      45: iconst_3      \n      46: invokestatic  #78                 // Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;\n      49: aastore       \n      50: invokestatic  #84                 // Method org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/ScriptBytecodeAdapter.createList:([Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/util/List;\n      53: new           #86                 // class \"GROOVY-7542$_test_closure1\"\n      56: dup           \n      57: aload_0       \n      58: aload_0       \n      59: aload_2       \n      60: invokespecial #89                 // Method \"GROOVY-7542$_test_closure1\".\"<init>\":(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Lgroovy/lang/Reference;)V\n      63: invokeinterface #92,  3           // InterfaceMethod org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/callsite/CallSite.call:(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;\n      68: areturn       \n      69: aconst_null   \n      70: areturn       \n```\n\nI guess I'm in right path; I'm no-where an byte code engineer, so in case if I have missed any of the cases, let me know. So that I can write an generic method for handling other bit-wise operators on the compile static mode!\n\nAfter this fix, the sample code was running perfectly fine and giving the expected results.
