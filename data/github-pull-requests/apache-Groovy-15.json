they were closely related, this PR also includes the following:\r\n\r\n1. A change to the fix introduced by GROOVY-7883 (b1d1232770aa) to prevent filtering protected methods in the `StaticTypeCheckingVisitor` if caller is in the same package. From the same commit, removes the test `Groovy7883Bug#test3` because it should compile and the new test introduced for GROOVY-8509 in `MethodCallsStaticCompilation` takes it place.\r\n\r\n1. A change to revert groovy.sql.Sql#asList (b1d1232770aa) back to `protected`. Fix for GROOVY-7883 enforced visibility for method calls in `TypedChecked` and `CompileStatic` modes. Test was originally put in place to verify the added ClosureParams, so changed test to access method via subclass so that the access modifier for the method can remain protected. I think the spirit of the test is preserved in this case without having to open access to the method under

Background\r\nAs we all know, Java array is one of features widely applied in Java projects. In order to improve the compatibility with Java(Copy & Paste), the PR on the new Parrot parser will make Groovy support java-like array. \r\n## Examples\r\n### One-Dimensional array\r\n```groovy\r\nString[] names = {'Jochen', 'Paul', 'Daniel'}\r\nassert ['Jochen', 'Paul', 'Daniel'].toArray() == names\r\n```\r\n```groovy\r\nString[] names = {'Daniel'} // Note: this is an array, not a closure\r\nassert ['Daniel'].toArray() == names\r\n```\r\n```groovy\r\nString[] names = {} // Note: this is an array, not a closure\r\nassert 0 == names.length\r\n```\r\n### Two-Dimensional array\r\n```groovy\r\nint[][] data = {\r\n    {1, 2, 3},\r\n    {4, 5, 6},\r\n    {7, 8, 9},\r\n    new int[] { 10, 11, 12 },\r\n    {13, 14, 15}\r\n}\r\nassert [1, 2, 3].toArray() == data[0]\r\nassert [4, 5, 6].toArray() == data[1]\r\nassert [7, 8, 9].toArray() == data[2]\r\nassert [10, 11, 12].toArray() == data[3]\r\nassert [13, 14, 15].toArray() == data[4]\r\n```\r\n```groovy\r\nint[][] data = new int[][] {\r\n    {1, 2, 3},\r\n    {4, 5, 6},\r\n    {7, 8, 9},\r\n    new int[] { 10, 11, 12 },\r\n    {13, 14, 15}\r\n}\r\nassert [1, 2, 3].toArray() == data[0]\r\nassert [4, 5, 6].toArray() == data[1]\r\nassert [7, 8, 9].toArray() == data[2]\r\nassert [10, 11, 12].toArray() == data[3]\r\nassert [13, 14, 15].toArray() == data[4]\r\n```\r\n```groovy\r\nint[][] data = {\r\n    {3},\r\n    {6},\r\n    {9},\r\n    new int[] {12},\r\n    {15},\r\n    {}\r\n}\r\nassert [3].toArray() == data[0]\r\nassert [6].toArray() == data[1]\r\nassert [9].toArray() == data[2]\r\nassert [12].toArray() == data[3]\r\nassert [15].toArray() == data[4]\r\nassert 0 == data[5].length\r\n```\r\n### Annotation array\r\n```groovy\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention\r\n\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\npublic @interface PropertySource {\r\n    String value();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\npublic @interface PropertySources {\r\n    PropertySource[] value();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@PropertySources({\r\n    @PropertySource(\"classpath:1.properties\"),\r\n    @PropertySource(\"file:2.properties\")\r\n})\r\npublic class Controller {}\r\n\r\ndef propertySources = Controller.getAnnotation(PropertySources).value()\r\nassert 2 == propertySources.length\r\ndef values = propertySources.collect { it.value() }\r\nassert ['classpath:1.properties', 'file:2.properties'] == values\r\n```\r\n### More array examples\r\nHere are some tests[[1]](https://github.com/danielsun1106/groovy/blob/f20deb8bd6a1a90a4bfee8458e13438f7adf3732/subprojects/parser-antlr4/src/test/resources/core/Array_02x.groovy) [[2]](https://github.com/danielsun1106/groovy/blob/c78b95888a176d05b3fd410f45866b2ceed8344c/subprojects/parser-antlr4/src/test/resources/core/Annotation_11x.groovy) for reference.\r\n## Limitation\r\nThe array type must be specified when declaring array, e.g.\r\n```groovy\r\nint[][] a = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}  // valid\r\ndef a = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}   // invalid\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Known breaking changes\r\n@paulk-asert  added some more details about breaking changes and suggested alternatives in the jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-8561\r\n### 1. `Closure` array in the dynamic mode\r\n#### Before\r\n  ```groovy\r\nClosure[] y = { {-> 1 + 1 } }\r\nassert y[0].call().call() == 2\r\n  ```\r\n#### After\r\n  ```groovy\r\nClosure[] y = { {-> 1 + 1 } }\r\nassert y[0].call() == 2\r\n  ```\r\n### 2. `String` array in the dynamic mode\r\n#### Before\r\n  ```groovy\r\nString[] a = {}\r\nassert 1 == a.length\r\nassert a[0].contains('closure')\r\n  ```\r\n#### After\r\n  ```groovy\r\nString[] a = {}\r\nassert 0 == a.length\r\n  ```\r\n## Provisos(by @paulk-asert )\r\n* we need to update the breaking changes section of 3.0.0 release notes on the website (site/src/site/releasenotes/groovy-3.0.adoc) to include the cases listed in GROOVY-8561\r\n* we need to update the \"Array initializers\" section of core-differences-java.adoc (we need to explain what cases remain - obviously if no array type is specified is one case - I haven't checked whether Java allows arrays of lambdas or something similar which we may not support - I don't believe so but haven't researched into it)\r\n* we need to update the \"Arrays\" section of core-syntax.adoc (I think we need to indicate that square brackets is the idiomatic approach and also explicitly say that closure is the default interpretation of curly braces unless the array target type can be inferred from the
