This allows planning to\r\n   take advantage of the fact that Druid sorts by dimensions when\r\n   doing aggregations.\r\n\r\n2) Windowing: inspect RelCollation trait from input, and insert naiveSort\r\n   if, and only if, necessary.\r\n\r\n3) Windowing: add support for Project after Window, when the Project\r\n   is a simple mapping. Helps eliminate subqueries.\r\n\r\n4) DruidRules: update logic for considering subqueries to reflect that\r\n   subqueries are not required to be GroupBys, and that we have a bunch\r\n   of new Stages now. With all of this evolution that has happened, the\r\n   old logic didn't quite make sense.\r\n\r\nNative changes:\r\n\r\n1) Use merge sort (stable) rather than quicksort when sorting\r\n   RowsAndColumns. Makes it easier to write test cases for plans that\r\n   involve re-sorting the data.","created_at":"2023-03-08T18:31:31Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T07:26:54Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T23:48:13Z","merged_at":"2023-03-09T23:48:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf39b4d313277be9e1dc91a6fe9d2749759ebb34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

#13879.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFixes issues when using `KafkaInputFormat` with the sampler API. My initial assessment in #13879 was only partially correct. The implementation of the `sample` method in `KafkaInputReader` also wasn't really correct since by just using the normal read path it did not correctly capture `ParseException` and so would fail immediately. I've adjusted the `sample` method to delegate to the underlying readers `sample`, which will correctly handle these, and changed the blending to occur on the `InputRowListPlusRawValues` of the underlying sample call instead.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nThe `KafkaInputFormat` now supports using the sampler API `/druid/indexer/v1/sampler`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

checks include a check of Maven dependencies: `dependency:analyze`. A recent PR had a build fail due to dependency issues. When fixing that, it was discovered that a great many modules have issues when the dependency checker is run as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn dependency:analyze -P skip-tests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dcyclonedx.skip=true -DfailOnWarning=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is unclear why the static checks run in GHA did not report these errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issues that arose when running the command. In some cases, the tool gets confused: it tells me that a dependency is declared, but not used. If I remove it, I'm told it is used, but not declared. In these cases, I had to configure the tool to ignore certain dependencies.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, both the `dependency:analyze` and full build passes. This PR will tell us if the tests also pass.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNo user-visible changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in

Description\r\n\r\nDo what the title says. The native `nvl` expression, besides being simpler to evaluate than `case_searched(notnull(...)...)`, it is also vectorized, so this should result in a performance improvement for any queries that would be otherwise vectorizable if not for something like a `NVL(x, 'no x')` or `COALESCE(x, 'no x')`. Multi-argument `COALESCE` still plans to a `CASE` statement, which is not vectorized.\r\n\r\nThe built-in `COALESCE` operator definition does some super early mandatory rewriting into a `CASE` statement a lot earlier than a convertlet could handle it, so I have updated our handling of `CASE` to look for cases it can rewrite into the native `NVL`. Along with this, I added some additional conversion logic to try to plan what more complicated coalesce/nvl expressions can sometimes plan to, which is an expression filter of the form `case when x is not null then expr1 else expr2 end` instead into something like `expr1 or (expr2 and x is null)` if either of expr1 or expr2 can translate into more optimal native filters.\r\n\r\nThis should result in a performance improvement in some cases, see benchmarks https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13897#issuecomment-1461122829\r\n\r\nThe performance of `NVL` vectorized hasn't really been optimized yet, so there might be some cases where vectorizing isn't always better, but it seems close enough for now. When the remaining conditional expressions are vectorized, my intention is to do them using a `VectorMatch` or something similar, in order to only partially evaluate the remaining conditional arguments as needed, instead of always evaluating all arguments like the current iteration of the vectorized `nvl` expression. At this point, I would expect it to almost always come out ahead of the non-vectorized version.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSQL operators `NVL` and `COALESCE` with 2 arguments now plan to a native `nvl` expression, which supports the vector engine. Multi-argument `COALESCE` still plans into a `case_searched`, which is not vectorized.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR

While the existing implementation offers some configurability, it is not enough for some users who will need to run Peons with a completely different pod spec from the master pod.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n* Allow users to specify a Kubernetes pod spec per task type.\r\n* Move PeonCommandContext creation to TaskAdapter since some implementations will not need it\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nThis PR only introduces the `PodTemplateTaskAdapter` it will be wired up in a forthcoming within the `KubernetesTaskRunnerFactory`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

generating tombstones for MSQ (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13706) the controller might run into OOM while trying to compute the intervals for which the tombstones need to be generated because we are materializing all the intervals which need to be marked by a tombstone, partitioned by granularity. So for a query that replaces over all, and the existing data source contains a segment for the eternity, this would generate a large number of intervals (given a finite granularity such as DAY).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of the tombstones generating logic wherein for the overlap, we only generate completely disjointed tombstones so that the number of intervals for which tombstones need to be generated do not explode. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n(none)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TombstoneHelper`\r\n * `TombstoneHelperTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

changes:\r\n\r\n1) UnnestDataSource: Replace \"column\" and \"outputName\" with \"virtualColumn\".\r\n   This enables pushing expressions into the datasource. This in turn\r\n   allows us to do the next thing...\r\n\r\n2) UnnestStorageAdapter: Logically apply query-level filters and virtual\r\n   columns after the unnest operation. (Physically, filters are pushed down,\r\n   when possible.) This is beneficial because it allows filters and\r\n   virtual columns to reference the unnested column, and because it is\r\n   consistent with how the join datasource works.\r\n\r\n3) Various documentation updates, including declaring \"unnest\" as an\r\n   experimental feature for now.\r\n\r\nSQL changes:\r\n\r\n1) Rename DruidUnnestRel (& Rule) to DruidUnnestRel (& Rule). The rel\r\n   is simplified: it only handles the UNNEST part of a correlated join.\r\n   Constant UNNESTs are handled with regular inline rels.\r\n\r\n2) Rework DruidCorrelateUnnestRule to focus on pulling Projects from\r\n   the left side up above the Correlate. Additionally, fix issues related to\r\n   tracking correlation variables.New test testUnnestTwice verifies\r\n   that this works even when two UNNESTs are stacked on the same table.\r\n\r\n3) Include ProjectCorrelateTransposeRule from Calcite to encourage\r\n   pushing mappings down below the left-hand side of the Correlate.\r\n\r\n4) Add a new CorrelateFilterLTransposeRule and CorrelateFilterRTransposeRule\r\n   to handle pulling Filters up above the Correlate. New tests\r\n   testUnnestWithFiltersOutside and testUnnestTwiceWithFilters verify\r\n   this behavior.\r\n\r\n5) Require a context feature flag for SQL UNNEST, since it's undocumented.\r\n   As part of this, also cleaned up how we handle feature flags in SQL.\r\n   They're now hooked into EngineFeatures, which is useful because not\r\n   all engines support all features.","created_at":"2023-03-07T12:23:22Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:01:01Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T11:12:08Z","merged_at":"2023-03-10T11:12:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b1ffbc452831178dccd38456ed9b2cdf2521d13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR modifies the SQL `CAST` operator conversion to use `Calcites.getColumnTypeForRelDataType` to convert calcite types to native Druid types instead of using its own custom `SqlTypeName ` to `ExprType` mapping to make it more consistent with other SQL to Druid type conversions done for most other operators. This allows it to handle some additional casts which were not previously supported, such as those with ARRAY types. The test added to `CalciteMultiValueStringQueryTest` was not able to be planned prior to the changes to the `CAST` operator since during planning explicit casts would be added which would then fail since the mapping table was missing arrays.\r\n\r\nSwitching `CAST` to use `Calcites.getColumnTypeForRelDataType` also required making a small adjustment to this method to be able to handle `SqlTypeName.DAY_INTERVAL_TYPES` and `SqlTypeName.YEAR_INTERVAL_TYPES` as a Druid `LONG` type. This also allows some additional expressions to be planned that were not previously supported, shown in the changes to `ExpressionsTest`, `GreatestExpressionTest`, and `LeastExpressionTest`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR relaxes multi-value string usage consistency validation to allow expressions like `nvl`, `isnull`, `notnull`, case and if statements, etc, to no longer automatically assume that their inputs must be scalar arguments.\r\n\r\nThis validation was added way back in #7588 as a means to ensure that a multi-value string column was being used consistently within an expression so that it cannot be considered both as an array and as a scalar value (which must be mapped across the multiple values). This system basically divided expressions up into expressions that definitely take array inputs and output arrays, and everything else. This worked well enough for lots of expressions, but a small handful don't fit this model, which is what this PR aims to help fix.\r\n\r\nThis system predates the native expression layer having full type inference, and I think it could be done a lot better, so I am also going to be trying to merge this much older analysis system into the type inference system in a follow-up PR, since all of the analysis of contextual usage and validation can be done at the same places where we doing the newer stuff (expression planner, etc).\r\n\r\nWhile here I also consolidated some calcite -> native druid type stuff for the cast operator, which allowed some additional expressions to plan correctly.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

is a revision to Druidâs error reporting structure. An [earlier PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13798) and [issue](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13123) introduced the concept of better error reporting. Discussion around that work refined and expanded the set of requirements: \r\n\r\n1. Better error messages for Druid users.\r\n2. Build on patterns established by MSQ.\r\n3. Require that users think of the persona who can act on each error message.\r\n4. Unique error code for each error condition.\r\n5. Deployments can customize error messages.\r\n6. Easier to search for specific log messages in a log management system.\r\n\r\nThe key new concepts in this PR are explained below.\r\n\r\nThis PR is another draft of the concept to solicit further comment.\r\n\r\n#### `MSQFault`\r\n\r\nThis PR models the `DruidException` class on the `MSQFault` class where feasible. [A previous note](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13798#issuecomment-1435377632) explained that `MSQFault` is tightly coupled to the MSQ error report framework and is thus not easily reusable. The present version of `DruidException` borrows the idea of creating subclasses for each kind of error, and of holding error âparametersâ as distinct values, rather than only as fields in the message text. This PR also borrows the idea of creating groups of error subclass to represent error types.\r\n\r\n#### Personas\r\n\r\nWriting good error messages is hard. To encourage developers to write better messages, we require the developer to think about who can act on the message: the target persona. All errors are sent to the user, but the user may not be the person who can fix the problem. For example, if the network is down, user operations will fail, but the user is generally not the persona who can fix network issues.\r\n\r\nTo help, every exception must have a target persona identified. Since classes of errors all tend to have the same target persona, the persona is generally set on a base class, which reduces the overhead of specifying the person each time we raise an exception.\r\n\r\nThe persona isnât actually used in this PR: we just require that it be set as a mental exercise.\r\n\r\n#### Error Translation\r\n\r\nDruid is used in many different ways. Developers tend to use Druid to create and debug new features. New users tend to use Druid on a single machine and play the role of user, app developer and system administrator. In these cases, the end user wants the full text of each error as they play a number of roles.\r\n\r\nOnce Druid lands in production, these roles are spread out across many different people. Druid is often embedded in part of a larger application. In those cases, the application may have its own terminology. Deployments may also chose to redact certain details from user messages. We call this âerror translation.â Even if the text remains in English, the wording is changed to be consistent with the overall application.\r\n\r\nTo support these use cases, this PR introduces the idea of separating the message âtemplateâ from the error âparametersâ. Druid provides a default template. Deployments can provide a file with customized templates. A number of features are required to realize this idea.\r\n\r\n#### Unique Error Codes\r\n\r\nTo aid translation, we propose that all errors have a unique text error code. Errors from the `/sql` endpoint already have an error code, but the code is not unique or each kind of error. The existing code is also a bit ad-hoc and unstructured. This draft suggests a three-part pattern:\r\n\r\n* General area, such as âSQLâ or âMSQâ\r\n* Sub-area, such as âParseâ or âValidationâ\r\n* Detail code, such as âInvalidTokenâ or âInvalidConstantâ.\r\n\r\nThe result is a unique code such as `SQL-Parse-InvalidToken` or `SQL-Validation-InvalidConstant`.\r\n\r\nThe errors map to an exception class hierarchy: we define a class for SQL Parse errors and another for SQL Validation errors. Each point in the code which raises an exception identifies the detail code. When the âsameâ error is defined in multiple places, a function can ensure that the various instances all use the same code. We could eventually create a centralized map of error codes if needed. Doing so seems overly complex at this time.\r\n\r\n#### Error Parameters\r\n\r\nMost exceptions include information. Which token is invalid? Which constant is invalid?\r\n\r\n`MSQFault` creates a subclass for each distinct error âtypeâ, defined as a unique set of error parameters. The earlier PR used an error âcontextâ to hold (a subset of) exception parameters. This version combines the two ideas. We hold error parameters as a map of key/value pairs. The reason for a map, rather than fields, will become clear shortly.\r\n\r\nWe combine error message templates with error parameters using the Apache Commons [`StringSubstitutor`](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/StringSubstitutor.html) class. For example:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTemplate: Line [${line}], Position [${column}]: Column [${name}] does not exist in any datasource in the query\r\nValues:   {âlineâ: 3, âColumnâ: 4, ânameâ: âfooâ}\r\nResult:   Line 3, Position 4: Column [foo] does not exist in any datasource in the query\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose an application prefers to use the words âfieldâ and âtableâ. Suppose also the application generates the SQL, so that error position in the SQL are not useful to the user. This application can provide its own template:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTemplate: Field â${name}â not found in any table. Ensure the field is valid.\r\nResult:   Field âfooâ not found in any table. Ensure the field is valid.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `StringSubstitutor` needs a map of values, it turns out to be simpler to store error parameters as a map than as individual fields. If the parameters were fields, each error class would need code to build a map from those fields.\r\n\r\nExample of raising an error with parameters:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  throw new SqlValidationError(\r\n\t\"ColumnNotFound\"\r\n        \"Line [${line}], Position [${column}]: Column [${name}] does not exist in any datasource in the query\"\r\n        )\r\n      .withValue(\"line\", lineNo)\r\n      .withValue(\"column\", col)\r\n      .withValue(\"name\", columnName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `SqlValidationError` class provides the top and second-level error code: `SQL-Validation`. The parameters in the template match the names of the values provided. As explained below, order of the values is important.\r\n\r\n#### Translation Files\r\n\r\nTo implement error translation, an application simply provides a custom \"error catalog\" in `conf/druid/errors.properties`. The file is a normal Java properties file that uses the error code as the key:\r\n\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSQL-Validation-ColumnNotFound=Field â${name}â not found in any table. Ensure the field is valid.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the file is not found, or cannot be read, or does not contain the key for a given error, then the Druid default format is used instead.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest possible solution to get started: we can refine as we gain feedback.\r\n\r\n#### Log Message Format\r\n\r\nGiven the above mechanism, we now have three distinct forms of error text:\r\n\r\n* The default Druid formatting\r\n* The translated message, which may redact some information\r\n* The logged form of the error\r\n\r\nThe logged message should provide all information to the administrator or other \"privileged\" user who must support the system. The log message must contain these details even if they are not returned to the user. Error logging is controlled by the `getMessage()` method. Thus, this method must return a form of the error that does not do translation.\r\n\r\nAs we improve error messages, we will add helpful text about how to resolve issues. That text need not appear in the log.\r\n\r\nWhen logs are fed into a log search system (such as Splunk or ElasticSearch), administrators want a simple way to search for a given error. Thus, the log message should include the error code.\r\n\r\nGiven this, the log format of an error, given by the `getMessage()` method, is of the form:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n<code>: <key>=[<value>]...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSQL-Validation-ColumnNotFound: line=[3], column=[4], name=[foo]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure the log format is stable, the `values` map in each exception is a `LinkedHashMap`: values appear in the log in the order in which they are added to the map.\r\n\r\n#### `getMessage()` and Tests\r\n\r\nSince `getMessage()` must produce the log form of a message, we use `toString()` to produce the default Druid format for the message. This format is primarily for debugging and testing.\r\n\r\nMessages are returned to the user via the REST response. In the proposed code, we do not serialize `DruidException` directly. Instead, we perform a conversion step from `DruidException` to the form needed for each REST call. The `/sql` endpoint uses one format, other RPC messages use other formats. (The multiple error formats is more of a \"bug\" than \"feature\", but we'll fix that another time.)\r\n\r\nThe mechanism to produce the `/sql` REST response also handles the translation. That mechanism requires Guice injection of the properties with the name of the translation file.\r\n\r\nMany Druid tests use the standard mechanism to verify error text: ask a JUnit or Hamcrest matcher to check the return value from `getMessage()`. These tests must change to use the log format. Or, they must change to use custom code to check the value of `toString()` to check the default Druid error text.\r\n\r\nOnce we settle on a design, a future commit will standardize SQL test error checking.\r\n\r\n#### Third Party Errors\r\n\r\nDruid uses Calcite to parse SQL. Druid has no control over Calcite messages. In this case, we translate the Calcite exception to a `DruidException` with one parameter, `message`, which holds the original Calcite text. Such text cannot be translated using the mechanism proposed here, though the entire message can be redacted.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, we could expand the error translator to include a function. That function can perform regular expression matches to \"peek inside\" the third party error, and reformat the message that way. The result is not elegant, but does solve the problem.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThis PR is a draft and is a proposal.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Use getProperty instead of getOrDefault\r\n`Properties.getOrDefault(...)` checks the main map within Properties and not the default map whereas `Properties.getProperty(...)` checks both.   When testing MSQ we saw that the check to see if intermediate durable storage returns false despite the property being set.  This is because the property was set within the default map and not the main map.  In [PropertiesModule](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/guice/PropertiesModule.java#L54) we initialize the Properties object with `fileProps` which contains the contents of common.runtime.properties and runtime properties.  These values get stored in the default map while system properties are stored in the main map.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MSQDurableStorageModule`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Given this, there is no need to allocate and deallocate a directory per task because only one task will ever use the directory, and in the case of the TaskStorageDirTracker only one of the specified directories will ever be used.

\"new\" IT framework provides a convenient way to package and run integration tests (ITs), but only for core modules. We have a use case to run an IT for a `contrib` extension: the proposed gRPC query extension. This PR provides the IT framework functionality to allow non-core ITs.\r\n\r\nThe `it.sh` script takes an option third parameter to specify the relative path to the Maven module that holds the test:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./it.sh test MyCategory extensions-contrib/my-extension-it\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the Maven build order, the ITs for an extension must be in a Maven module separate from the extension itself. In this case, `my-extension` is the extension, while `my-extension-it` are the ITs for that extension.\r\n\r\nThe layout in the extension mimics the existing `cases` module. Provide a Maven file that runs the tests using FailSafe. Provide a `cluster` directory structured as explained in the IT docs.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Extensions\r\n\r\nContrib extensions are not added to the base Docker image. They can still be used in a test:\r\n\r\n* Create an `extensions` directory in the shared folder (mounted at `/shared` in the container.)\r\n* Unpack the extension to this directory so you have `extensions/my-extn`.\r\n* Add the _absolute path_ to the extension in your `docker_compose.py` file: `/shared/extensions/my-extn`\r\n\r\n#### Revision to IT Structure\r\n\r\nAs part of this work, several changes were made to the structure of the existing IT directory.\r\n\r\n* The Python \"template\" for Docker Compose moves from `templates/Category.py` to `cluster/Category/docker-compose.py`.\r\n* A new 'cluster/Category/verify.sh` script peforms pre-test checks. The awkward code that was in `.it.sh` to check for required environment variables moved into `verify.sh`.\r\n* A new `cluster/Category/setup.sh` script does any additional setup needed before launching an IT cluster. Use this to add additional files to the `shared` directory, for example. Using the script is _far_ easier than trying to script in Maven.\r\n* The cluster startup and shutdown steps were removed from `cases/pom.xml`. We were not using them: we now use `it.sh` to do this work.\r\n* The `it.sh` and `cluster.sh` scripts are now aware of two modules: the \"base\" `cases` module, and the \"test\" module. Before now, those were the same. Not they can differ.\r\n\r\n#### Prevent Snapshot Downloading\r\n\r\nAlso added configuration to the root `pom.xml` file to prevent an attempt to download snapshots from upstream. This most often happens when dependencies are missing and Maven cannot find a required Druid module, and instead tries to ask upstream repos. Bad Things would happen if it actually found such jars.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nAdded the `druid.extensions.path` config setting. This setting is optional and is normally not set. Primarily for testing. See `configuration/index.md` for details.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added internal documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in an integration test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-02T21:46:58Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:35:13Z","closed_at":"2023-05-15T14:59:51Z","merged_at":"2023-05-15T14:59:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c0983c8e9e3b5286bf0f22da0d3a3cac6708e36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

the possibility to restore and then re-cache only partially matching cache'd keys.

Description\r\nIterating on #12277 to continue experimentation, this PR introduces 'V1' of `FrontCodedIndexed`, the backing structure of the `frontCoded` string encoding strategy. This version stores values in buckets based on a prefix of the previous value instead of the first value in the bucket like v0. This improves overall storage size, particularly with using larger buckets.\r\n\r\nInternally, it adds a new `useIncrementalBuckets` option to `FrontCodedIndexedWriter`, which is always set to true to cause it to write out the new version of `FrontCodedIndexed`. The flag remains so tests can still write V0, and V0 coexists with V1 inside of the `FrontCodedIndexed` as well for backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\n![AFC4B099-CC5D-4564-87D6-7151AE606FF8

testing durable shuffle storage, intermittently rate limiting on DELETE object operations is observed in the logs. Further, sometimes there are failures in the job due to us trying to open streams on s3 objects which have been already deleted.\r\nA couple of changes are done to fix these problems : \r\n1. Do the worker level DELETE op only once which cleans up all the partitions for a stage for that worker\r\n2. When the S3 input stream (Sequence stream of chunks) is closed, avoid the default behavior of the `SequenceInputStream` to open/close all the chunks. Since our chunking is lazy, we can just close the current chunk stream and then exit.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the ability to have auto-compaction continuously\r\nschedule compaction tasks as slots become available.\r\n\r\nPreviously, each run of the CompactSegments duty built an iterator based on\r\nthe latest segment metadata available. This meant that if the compact tasks\r\nthat were scheduled ran into any issues, like task lock contention, or an\r\ninterval which can not be compacted because of a bug, auto-compaction would\r\nbe stuck on the cluster.\r\n    \r\nWith this change, CompactSegments, refreshes it's view of the segments based\r\non the `druid.coordinator.compaction.searchPolicyRefreshPeriod` property.\r\nThis allows auto-compaction to continue to make progress if any interval\r\nfails to compact until the search policy is refreshed.\r\n    \r\nCompaction statistics for the cluster are only refreshed when the search\r\npolicy is refreshed. This is because to collect statistics, the task has\r\nto run through the entire list of available segments on the cluster which\r\ncan take a long time on large clusters\r\n    \r\nTo enable this behavior on the cluster, add something like this to the\r\ncoordinator runtime properties\r\n    \r\n```\r\ndruid.coordinator.dutyGroups=[\"compaction\"]\r\ndruid.coordinator.compaction.duties=[\"compactSegments\"]\r\ndruid.coordinator.compaction.period=PT20S\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNew: You can now schedule automatic compaction to run continuously and configure\r\nhow frequently it should consider new segments for compaction\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### High level implementation\r\n\r\n`CompactSegments` remains the duty that performs auto-compaction related\r\nprocessing. The period at which the `CompactionSegmentSearchPolicy` is reset\r\nis de-coupled from the `CompactSegments` run duty, allowing `CompactSegments`\r\nto run independently of any concerns from the segment metadata refresh.\r\n\r\n###### Other implementation considerations\r\n- `NewestSegmentFirstSearchPolicy#resetIfNeeded` - To implement this, I had explored\r\nusing a `LoadingCache` and a `MemoizingSupplierWithExpiration`, unfortunately neither\r\nof these options seemed to work well because of the need to know when the policy was\r\nreset so that compaction stats could be computed.\r\n- New CompactSegment duties vs re-using the existing duty: The existing duty code is dense\r\nand seemed risky to refactor since auto-compaction is a widely adopted feature. I explored the\r\nidea of deprecating the existing duty and introducing 2 new duties - one to reset the policy and\r\nanother to read from the iterator. I abandoned this approach because of the risk of refactoring\r\nand because choosing how to wire up the duties seemed more complicated in this model.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * CompactionSegmentSearchPolicy#resetIfNeeded\r\n * CompactSegments#makeStats calculates stats without iterating over the iterator.\r\nThis is done so that other calls to CompactSegments can continue to make progress\r\nschedule other intervals to be compacted without needing to reset the policy.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Future changes\r\n- With this change an operator still needs to place the CompactSegments duty\r\nin a custom duty group with a faster period than the Indexing duty period\r\nto take advantage of this change.\r\nA future change should change this so that auto-compaction is scheduled\r\nto run continuously by default.\r\n- A new API should be introduced to enable a cluster operator to force reset\r\nthe CompactionSegmentSearchPolicy at the next CompactSegments run. This will\r\nbe useful in demo situations, or if a large ingestion has just taken place\r\nand the cluster operator wants to get auto-compaction to start processing these\r\nsegments immediately.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis change is built on top of #13842 \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nA small refactoring that makes the search policy for compaction injectable.\r\n\r\nFuture changes can introduce new search policies that can be configured and injected so that operators can choose which search policy is best suited for their cluster.\r\n\r\nThis will also allow us to de-couple the scheduling of compaction jobs from the CompactSegments duty, allowing the co-ordinator to schedule compaction jobs faster than the duty lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThis PR is made so that it easy to review the future changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test

For example: -->\r\n\r\nLet's first recall that there are two type of DeterminePartitionsJob.\r\n-  When the input data is not assume grouped, there may be duplicate rows. We will launch two mr job. The first one do group job to remove duplicate rows. Then the second one do global sorting to find lower and upper bound for target segments.\r\n- When the input data is assume grouped, we only need to launch the global sorting mr job to find lower and upper bound for segments.\r\n\r\nAs we don't need a segment size which exactly equals the targetRowsPerSegment parameter, we can sample the input data to improve the DeterminePartitionsJob. Let me explain how to use the sampling factor to improve  the DeterminePartitionsJob.\r\n- If the input data is assume grouped, we just do sample by random at the mapper side of the global sort mr job.\r\n- If the input data is not assume grouped, we do sample at the mapper of the group job. We use hash on time and all dimensions and mod by sampling factor to do sample, we don't use random method because there may be duplicate rows.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we ingest 10,000,000,000 rows and the targetRowsPerSegment is 5,000,000, we can sample by 500, so the DeterminePartitionsJob only need process 20,000,000 rows, this helps save a lot of time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nInspired by [this change](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13812), skip UTs and ITs when there are markdown only changes anywhere in the project. For example, changes to `README` files in `integration-tests`, `integration-tests-ex`, extensions shouldn't trigger the tests to run.\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nPrevious change https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13632 added double quotes to quote identifiers in JDBC lookups per the SQL standard. However, that only works with databases like PostgresDB and Derby that use double quotes. On the other hand, MySQL and MariaDB use the backtick character to quote identifiers by default. This change-set enables the `ANSI_SQL` mode per JDBC connection/session so we can write SQL that works with most SQL-compliant databases. It has been tested manually on the different supported databases. UTs that use the Derby connector were already modified in the previous change and test this functionality implicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

ran into a situation where a task failed with an error \"Aborting Transaction\". The error is not user-friendly and doesn't really tell the user what they can do about it. In this PR, I try to surface the actual error that caused the transaction to be aborted. So users don't have to stitch together an error in overlord logs and a failure message in task reports to figure out what's going on. \r\n\r\nApart from that, changed the error message of query timeout exceptions. A user, who is issuing a query, doesn't know anything about the sequence iterator. We developers often throw errors that can include too many implementation details. These details can appear daunting to users who are just starting out. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-16T11:04:53Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:01:25Z","closed_at":"2023-03-08T02:10:18Z","merged_at":"2023-03-08T02:10:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"52bd9e6adb203f279680fb0edf6e939436bf8982","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR removes numeric null value coercion from the expression processing engine in favor of doing it on the consumer side. This appears to have minimal impact, since `isNumericNull` will still return false in default value mode, and numeric operators check this and use the numeric primitive methods of `ExprEval` instead of `value()`. This walks back some of the changes in #13781. To help push this responsibility onto callers, a new method has been added `ExprEval.valueOrDefault()` as a convenience/alternative to `value()`, which will perform the coercion for callers if they wish, which many of them do.\r\n\r\nSince vector expression processors are only used at query time, I've modified the 'null vectors' (`boolean[]`), I've modified them to consistently only set to true if `NullHandling.sqlCompatible()` is true. Alternatively, we could have also instead checked `NullHandling.sqlCompatible()` in the places we are using these null vectors, but doing it this way seemed more consistent with other vectorized selectors.\r\n\r\nBackstory, it would be nice to always write null values into segments, shifting `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull` to a query time only setting on whether or not to use the null value bitmap index when scanning/aggregating columns. However, I have not made this change yet in this PR.\r\n\r\nUnrelated, I have renamed `Expr.buildVectorized` to `Expr.asVectorProcessor` to be consistent with `Function.asVectorProcessor` and `ApplyFunction.asVectorProcessor`, and also added some javadocs to `VectorProcessors`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNull values input to and created by the Druid native expression processing engine no longer coerce `null` to the type appropriate 'default' value if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=true`. This should not impact existing behavior since this has been shifted onto the consumer and internally operators will still use default values in this mode, but calling this change to attention in case any subtle behavior changes around the handling of `null` values. Direct callers can get default values by using the new `valueOrDefault()` method of `ExprEval`, instead of `value()`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#13536 \r\nObsoletes #13538 \r\n\r\nThis PR should only be merged after #13783 as it is forked off of that branch due to requiring some changes made there.\r\nThe chart version bump is incremental

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes the SQL Compatibility logic so that the description of a test (true/false) actually matches the condition of the test (SQL Compatibility mode on or off).\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

So, let's flip the logic on the variable so the `true/false` you see in the test actually matches the mode itself.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for storing arrays of primitive values (`ARRAY<STRING>`, `ARRAY<LONG>` and `ARRAY<DOUBLE>`) as specialized nested columns, instead of the current strategy which stores a separate nested column for each array element.\r\n\r\nBasically it works by adding an additional value dictionary for all array values to our current `STRING` -> `LONG` -> `DOUBLE` dictionary stack. The array dictionary stores `int[]` values, where the elements are globalIds that point to values in the `STRING`/`LONG`/`DOUBLE` value dictionaries.\r\n\r\n![E110E6BE-2856-4E09-BADA-575284BB3187 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/218812357-45f333c2-389d-4ad0-bee0-0e8b7c33a1cf.png)\r\n\r\nSo instead of the 2-phase lookup that scalar nested columns have, nested array values have a 3-phase lookup - first lookup localId -> globalId, which gives an int[] of global ids which can then be translated into the actual values.\r\n\r\nThis dictionary is stored with a newly added `FrontCodedIntArrayIndexed`, which is pretty similar to `FrontCodedIndexed` added in #12277, but storing `int[]` instead of `byte[]`. There is probably more code that could be shared between the two implementations (currently there is none and `FrontCodedIntArrayIndexed` and its writer are complete copies).\r\n\r\n_additional description TBD_\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* add support for storing nested arrays of string, long, and double values as specialized nested columns instead of breaking them into separate element columns\r\n* nested column typic mimic behavior means that columns ingested with only root arrays of primitive values will be ARRAY typed columns\r\n* neat test stuff\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1242\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-02 at 6 54 05 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/218803387-971251c3-879d-4856-9583-bce1f165f680.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"995\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 2 21 33 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/218803657-af960ae6-c576-492c-8076-a9cd17e7e7e4.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"772\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-07 at 5 05 21 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/218803814-9fd5edaf-2d23-4daa-9e0e-38cf17bd0b30.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

newer, different take on a solution is available in #13884. This PR is left open so we can compare the two approaches.\r\n\r\nIssue #13123 suggests an enhanced format for Druid exceptions. This PR introduces that new format for SQL error messages. This PR is meant as a POC to solicit feedback about the approach. The present commit represents a major revision based on the helpful feedback from the first commit.\r\n\r\nThe key abstraction is `DruidException` which holds an error category, an error message and a variety of additional attributes.\r\n\r\nThe error category groups errors by target audience (user, admin, etc.), and further categorizes by functional area (SQL parse error, SQL validation error, etc.) The error categories map to existing Druid error codes for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nOther attributes include `host` (for errors returned from remote nodes), the `errorClass` (the class name of the exception originally used to throw the exception), the and a context. The context consists of key/value pairs with additional information that manage systems may chose to redact.\r\n\r\nGood error messages include suggestions for how to resolve the error. But, those suggestions, even if well-intentioned, may not make sense in a managed system. (For example, it isn't helpful to tell the end user to add more memory if the end user doesn't manage the system.) Errors thus add the resolution suggestion as an attribute which managed systems may choose to strip off from messages shown to the user.\r\n\r\nFollowing MSQ practice, each error category has a dedicated exception. Thus, to throw a SQL validation exception:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  throw new SqlValidationError(\"Can't use type [%s] with function FOO\", theType);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach exception class maps to an error category. The error category maps to the error code, the audience, the HTTP return code, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the query engine, exceptions are converted to a specific JSON format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": \"<error code>\",\r\n  \"errorMessage\": \"<error message>\",\r\n  \"errorClass\": \"<full name of original exception class>\",\r\n  \"host\": \"<remote host>\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot remove fields, we can add fields, which we do for the suggested resolution and the context. See examples.\r\n\r\nThe goal is for `DruidException` to be used everywhere, including for REST APIs that have other error formats. (For better or works each API more-or-less defined its own format: some use JSON, some use text, some use an abbreviated form of the above JSON, etc.)\r\n\r\nSince a single JSON serialization cannot satisfy all REST clients, we use the query format as the default, but expect other APIs to map the contents of Druid exception into their existing formats. It would require a separate project (and much trepidation) to change the format of our many ad-hoc HTTP error responses.\r\n\r\nThe `DruidException` class is meant to communicate errors to the user. It should be thrown when the receiver of the exception is the REST RPC layer. There are times when code wants to throw a specific exception to some other part of the code. Those cases should continue to use specific error classes. For example, if a cache throws a \"not found\" exception, that cause something to download a file and insert it into the cache, that code should _not_ use a `DruidException` as this is not an event that terminates an RPC request.\r\n\r\nWhile the immediate target is always the end user (who, after all, sent the active RPC request), the _ultimate_ target may be different. Configuration errors can best be addressed by the system administrator, not the end users, say. In this case, the error may include additional details which a managed system may choose to redact. Those details are, however, written to the log for inspection by the ultimate target user.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nHere's an example for a SQL parse error:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"error\":\"SQL parse failed\",\r\n   \"errorMessage\":\"Line [1], column [1]: unexpected token [INSERT]\",\r\n   \"suggestion\": \"Expected: \\\"UNION\\\", \\\"INTERSECT\\\", \\\"EXCEPT\\\", \\\"MINUS\\\", \\\"ORDER\\\", \\\"LIMIT\\\", \\\"OFFSET\\\", \\\"FETCH\\\", \\\"STREAM\\\", \\\"DISTINCT\\\", ...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the use of brackets is a Druid convention, even if it may be unfamiliar to users. Here, we err on the side of what Druid developers expect, rather than what may read well for users.\r\n\r\nA client should display the above message as:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSQL parse failed - Line [1], column [1]: unexpected token [INSERT]\r\nExpected: \"UNION\", \"INTERSECT\", \"EXCEPT\", \"MINUS\", \"ORDER\", \"LIMIT\", \"OFFSET\", \"FETCH\", \"STREAM\", \"DISTINCT\", ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA logged version of this would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n2023-02-11T21:15:21,578 INFO [thread-name] org.apache.druid.error.SqlParseError - Line [1], column [1]: unexpected token [INSERT]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class name is for a `DruidException` subclass which directly corresponds to an error category which simplifies text searches in log systems.\r\n\r\nCalcite validation error:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"error\":\"Plan validation failed\",\r\n   \"message\":\"Line [1,] Column [8]: Column 'foo' not found in any table\",\r\n  \"errorClass\": \"org.apache.calcite.tools.ValidationException\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the displayed result as:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nPlan validation failed - Line [1,] Column [8]: Column 'foo' not found in any table\r\n```\r\nThe log format is:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n2023-02-11T21:15:21,578 INFO [thread-name] org.apache.druid.error.SqlValidationError - Line 1, Column 8: Column 'foo' not found in any table\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Specific Changes\r\n\r\nAll places in the SQL module that throw exceptions where modified to throw a `DruidException` instead. Some minor effort went into tidying up error messages: more could be done on this front.\r\n\r\nNo exceptions in other modules were converted. Doing so is a big project that we'd consider only if we like how the SQL conversion works out. There are places in Druid where REST errors are inconsistent: the error message is HTML, or text, or an ad-hoc JSON format. Over time, we'd want to unify these to always return the JSON `DruidException` format. None of that work is reflected here.\r\n\r\nA `RestExceptionEncoder` interface provides an implementation to format a `DruidException` for return as a REST error object. The `StandardRestExceptionEncoder` includes all the information. A site-specific implementation could \"sanitize\" the error by, say, converting all `SYSTEM` errors to \"Internal error. Please contact Support for assistance.\" Or, hide some of the context information, as noted above. For now, `StandardRestExceptionEncoder` is hard-coded. It would eventually be configured via Guice so an extension can replace it. For the `/sql` endpoint, the encoder will probably just be discarded, and the `DruidException` will do the encoding itself. Other REST endpoints would create their own encoders for their own ad-hoc error formtas.\r\n\r\nA recent PR cleaned up execution errors for native queries. Eventually, that code should be revised to use `DruidException`, but that work has not yet been done. For now, `DruidException` is yet another exception that the `QueryResultPusher` has to handle.\r\n\r\n### Remote Errors\r\n\r\nThe `QueryException` class is sent from worker nodes to the Broker, where it is deserialized to create another `QueryException. To move to `DruidException`, we will serialize only those fields which already exist in `QueryException`. This is necessary because the over-the-wire format cannot change: changing the format may break rolling upgrades. We must first modify the Broker side to allow responses with additional fields. Then, several releases later, we can add fields on the sender side. (Druid, unfortunately, has only rudimentary support for message evolution.) The result is that we will lose information. As a result, messages from the native query stack cannot make use of the new fields: `suggestion` and `context`.\r\n\r\nOn the Broker side, old Brokers will deserialize the error response as `QueryException`, while newer brokers will deserialize as a `GenericDruidException`: a form which mimics `QueryException` in handling multiple error categories. (Recall that most `DruidException` subclasses represent a single category.)\r\n\r\nWe do not expect clients to deserialize errors coming from the `/sql` endpoint into Druid classes, if only because clients don't have access to Druid code. Tests, however, do deserialize exceptions. These tests will be modified to deserialize to `GenericDruidException` just as the Broker does.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatible Error Classes\r\n\r\nThis proposal introduces a new set of exception classes. However, Druid exposes the exception implementation via the `errorClass` field. Many tests enforce that this field must be set to the name of now-obsolete exception classes. To handle this, each exception class can provide a custom value for `errorClass`. Where test depend on the old values, the new exceptions will \"lie\" and report the old class names. This pattern will also prevent problems with non-Druid clients that depend on the error class names. (Hint: it is never a good idea to expose internal class names n an API. But, it has been done, so we have to live with it.)\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThis is a POC, so no release note yet. If we like where this is going, we'll want to inform users of the change to the REST error format.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n`VirtualColumnRegistry` was missing a null check for the `ColumnCapabilities` returned by a `VirtualColumn`, resulting in a null pointer exception. The added test triggers the condition without the change to `VirtualColumnRegistry`.\r\n\r\nThis can be triggered by using the `JSON_VALUE` function with any non-root path on any non-nested column or any nested column that only had scalar values. For example, `JSON_VALUE(string, '$.x')` or `JSON_VALUE(nestedColumnThatOnlyHadScalarValues, '$[1]')` can both trigger the null pointer exception.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nThis PR adds customizable global and per-container environment variable appended array objects.\r\n\r\nThere already exists the ability to add basic key/value configurable variables via the global `configVars` and per-container `config` maps however the format they are implemented in does not support the broader Kubernetes environment variable use cases.\r\n\r\nFor example if a person wanted to pass in `druid_metadata_storage_connector_password` via an existing Kubernetes secret this would not be possible in the existing config.\r\n\r\nThis PR would allow for pulling of environment variables from secrets, configmaps, and any other K8s supported environment variable configuration on a global and per-container basis.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the `Chart.yaml` version is bumped to `0.3.6` from `0.3.3` because #13747 and #13783 came first.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAdd customizable global and per-container env vars to helm chart\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Added a line in the docker entrypoint that copies an additional directory into the common conf directory\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBefore this change, adding files to the common conf dir when deploying on Kubernetes was impossible due to the entrypoint script copying from a single source and that the source folder has a configMap Mounted to it in a read-only mode.\r\n\r\nMy Solution is to add an environment variable that will point to a directory where a configmap containing all the wanted files will be mounted to.\r\n\r\nThe need that led was configuring the hdfs extension and needing to provide multiple XML files to that directory.\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed in this PR\r\n * `New: You can now add additional configuration files to be copied to the final conf directory on startup when running in a containerized environment. Useful for running on Kubernetes and needing to add more files with a config map. To specify the path where the configMap is mounted, utilize the DRUID_ADDITIONAL_CONF_DIR environment variable.`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the wording around the mysterious `InvalidNullByteException`. The exception occurs when the strings that are added to the frame contain the 0x0000 byte which is internally being used as a delimiter in the case of a string column. The current use case for the frames is MSQ exclusively, and this error will only be generated if the ingested external data contains hidden null bytes, which in most cases can safely be sanitized.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

occurs for non MSQ queries for the same aggregations on a lookup as the source (as __time is not present).\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has been changed to throw an exception requesting the user to use

Druid catalog project introduces a `CatalogResolver` interface to resolve catalog entries. This PR adds the interface, and wires it up to the SQL planner stack, but does not provide the \"live\" implementation: that will come in a subsequent PR. This PR provides only the dummy \"null\" implementation. Nor does this PR change the Calcite planner to use the resolver: that will also come later. This PR simply pulls out a bunch of refactoring to make it easier to review.\r\n\r\nThis interface is configured via Guice and passed to the planner factory. The planner factory constructor has grown to take a large number of objects. As it turns out, the objects form two groups: those that are globals and provided via Guice, and those that can vary per-query, especially in unit tests. To reflect this, the `PlannerFactory` is split, with a new `PlannerToolbox` providing the fixed, global objects. `PlannerFactory` extends `PlannerToolbox` to add the per-query items.\r\n\r\nThe `PlannerContext` duplicated many methods of `PlannerFactory` and simply passed along the same values. Most of those were the fixed values. The code is refactored so that `PlannerContext` holds an instance of `PlannerToolbox`, and code that needs the global items gets them from the `PlannerToolbox` instead.\r\n\r\nSince we're doing refactoring, this is a good time to add the `PlannerHook` to the planner context so it is available to capture the \"physical plan\" in a later PR.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we create an instance of `PlannerFactory`, we now have to pass in an instance of the `CatalogResolver`. As a result, a large number of test files had to make this trivial change.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces no user-visible changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

recently introduced a Jupyter notebook to explain how to use the Druid REST API. That notebook works though the detailed, low-level steps to use the Python `requests` package to make selected Druid REST calls. The result is excellent for explaining the mechanics of each REST call, but a bit fiddly if we want to create a notebook that explains Druid concepts (rather than REST concepts.)\r\n\r\nIn response, this PR introduces a Python-based Druid API (or SDK) that handles the boilerplate of using `requests` to call Druid and parse the JSON results. What was many lines of Python code at the REST level is now a single line of code at the Druid SDK level.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes an \"intro to the Python API\" notebook which is not an exhaustive reference. Rather, it gives just enough information to see how to use the API, and explains how to get the details. A later PR will include a notebook that uses this API to explain a new feature.\r\n\r\nThe PR also revises existing notebooks and the README to reference the new API. The previous `README.md` didn't play when viewed in Jupyter: it seems Jupyter doesn't know how to render such files (oddly). Instead, the file was split into a \"pre-Juypter\" README that explains how to get started, and a post-Jupyter \"- START HERE -\" notebook that has the rest of the information once Jupyter is up and running.\r\n\r\nUpdated the doc files accordingly.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR changes no \"production\" code: everything is confined to the `quickstart` examples.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThis release extends the tutorial Jupyter notebooks to add a simple Python API to access Druid, along with a notebook that explains how to use that API.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar
