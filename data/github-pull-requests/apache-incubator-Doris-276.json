Proposed changes\r\nIn previous version, if the output slot of analyticExpr is not materialized, the analyticExpr is pruned.\r\nBut there are some cases that it cannot be pruned.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n                   SELECT\r\n                        count(*)\r\n                    FROM T1,\r\n                        (SELECT dd\r\n                        FROM (\r\n                            SELECT\r\n                                1.1 as cc,\r\n                                ROW_NUMBER() OVER() as dd\r\n                            FROM T2\r\n                            ) V1\r\n                        ORDER BY cc DESC\r\n                        limit 1\r\n                        ) V2;\r\n\r\n\r\n analyticExpr(ROW_NUMBER() OVER() as dd) is not materialized, but we have to generate\r\n WindowGroup for it.\r\n tmp.dd is used by upper count(*), we have to generate data for tmp.dd\r\n\r\nIn this fix, if an inline view only output one column(in this example, the 'dd'), we materialize this column.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n In order to prune 'ROW_NUMBER() OVER() as dd', we need to rethink the rule of choosing a column\r\n for count(*). (refer to SingleNodePlanner.materializeTableResultForCrossJoinOrCountStar)\r\n V2 can be transformed to\r\n                        \r\n\r\n       SELECT cc\r\n        FROM (\r\n            SELECT\r\n                1.1 as cc,\r\n                ROW_NUMBER() OVER() as dd\r\n            FROM T2\r\n            ) V1\r\n        ORDER BY cc DESC\r\n        limit 1\r\n        ) V2;\r\nExcept the byte size of cc and dd, we need to consider the cost to generate cc and dd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\nDesigned with @pengxiangyu together.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, BE will launch a thread to calculate unused remote files periodically and then ask FE to confirm. After confirm success, BE will delete these unused remote files. The conditions for confirmation are: \r\n1. Replica which send confirm request is cooldown replica.\r\n2. All replicas of a tablet have the same cooldown meta id which means all replicas share the same cooldowned rowsets.\r\n3. FE is master.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDelete bitmap will be calculate when memtable flush and publish. The two stages may see different versions.\r\nWhen there is sequence column, the currently imported data of rowset may be marked for deletion at memtablet flush or publish because the seq column is smaller than the previous rowset. \r\nFinally, the real version of delete bitmap will be updated. Because the set operation is used, so the delete bitmap of a certain version is lost.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen file cache enabled, running the same query for the second time may be still slow, for `FE` will assign the same scan range into different backends among different queries,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\nAt the storage layer, the raw data of the index column will still be read after apply index(bitmap_index or inverted_index), although the index column is not in the result column returned by the query, that will generate more performance overhead on seek and read data.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when there are multi-table join query, there will be many in or not_in predicate of runtime filter pushed down to the storage layer. According to our test,  if apply those predicates by inverted index, the performance will be degraded because there are many conditions in in_predicate. Therefore, the inverted index not apply on in or not_in predicate which is produced by runtime_filter.\r\n\r\nBased on that situation, this pr will do:\r\n1. reduce overhead on seek and read data for index column that only in where clause, optimization for query sql like:\r\n```\r\nsql 1: SELECT timestamp FROM tb WHERE log MATCH 'error';\r\nsql 2: SELECT timestamp FROM tb WHERE log MATCH 'error' ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 2;\r\nsql 3: SELECT timestamp FROM tb WHERE log MATCH 'error' AND status = 404;\r\nsql 4: SELECT timestamp FROM tb WHERE log MATCH 'error' AND status = 404 ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;\r\nsql 5: SELECT count() FROM tb WHERE log MATCH 'error';\r\n```\r\ncolumn `log` and column `status` is inverted index or bitmap index, above sqls only need seek and read data of column `timestamp`\r\n\r\n2. not apply inverted index on in or not_in predicate which is produced by runtime_filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDoris always delays the execution of expressions as possible as it can, so as the expansion of constant expression. Given below SQL:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect count(*) from (select 'abc' as i, sum(birth) as j from  subquerytest2) as tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe aggregation would be eliminated, since its output is not required by the outer block, but the expasion for constant expression would be done in the final result expr, and since aggreagete output has been eliminate, the expasion would actually do nothing, and finally cause a empty results.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we materialize the results expr in the inner block for such SQL, it may affect performance, but better than let system produce a mistaken result.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

be.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43750022/217737421-c83f3a6e-a0f8-48d4-89ea-9ec67e789762.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43750022/217737660-6fda84ab-3618-419f-9138-4dbdec82cec3.png)\r\n\r\nBTW, the former logic would record microsecond but would push seconds to be, so I changed the time unit to second.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n##

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`CachedRemoteFileReader` has used fixed segment size(file_cache_max_file_segment_size=4M) to cache remote file blocks. However, the column size in a rowgroup/strip maybe smaller than 10K if a parquet/orc file has many columns, resulting in particularly serious read amplification. For example:\r\nQ1 in clickbench: select count(*) from hits\r\n```\r\n-  FileCache:  0ns\r\n  -  IOHitCacheNum:  552\r\n  -  IOTotalNum:  835\r\n  -  ReadFromFileCacheBytes:  19.98  MB\r\n  -  ReadFromWriteCacheBytes:  0.00  \r\n  -  ReadTotalBytes:  29.52  MB\r\n  -  SkipCacheBytes:  0.00  \r\n  -  WriteInFileCacheBytes:  915.77  MB\r\n  -  WriteInFileCacheNum:  283 \r\n```\r\nOnly 30MB of data is needed, but 900MB+ of data is read from hdfs. The query time of Q1(single scan thread) increased from **5.17s** to **24.45s** when enable file cache.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR introduce dynamic segment size which is based on the `read_size` of the data. In order to prevent too small or too large IO, the segment size is limited in [4096, file_cache_max_file_segment_size].\r\n\r\nQ1 in clickbench is **5.66s** when enable file cache. The performance is almost the same as if the cache is disabled, and the data size read from hdfs is reduced to 45MB.\r\n```\r\n-  FileCache:  0ns\r\n    -  IOHitCacheNum:  297\r\n    -  IOTotalNum:  835\r\n    -  ReadFromFileCacheBytes:  8.73  MB\r\n    -  ReadFromWriteCacheBytes:  0.00  \r\n    -  ReadTotalBytes:  29.52  MB\r\n    -  SkipCacheBytes:  0.00  \r\n    -  WriteInFileCacheBytes:  45.66  MB\r\n    -  WriteInFileCacheNum:  544\r\n```\r\n## Remaining Problems\r\nSmall queries may result in a large number of small files(4KB at least), and the `BE` saves too much meta information of cached segments.\r\n\r\n## Fix bug\r\n`FileCachePolicy` in `FileReaderOptions` is a constant reference, but the parameter passed in `FileFactory::create_file_reader` is a temporary variable, resulting in segmentation fault.\r\n\r\n## Experiment on S3\r\nQuery the `orders` table of tpch 100g:\r\n```sql\r\nselect count(o_shippriority) from orders\r\n```\r\nThe actual bytes to read is `ReadTotalBytes:  3.04  MB`\r\n| segment_size | profile |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| 4MB | WriteInFileCacheBytes:  360.94  MB <br> FileReadTime:  18s639ms |\r\n| 2MB | WriteInFileCacheBytes:   128.73  MB <br> FileReadTime:  13s721ms |\r\n| 1MB | WriteInFileCacheBytes:  91.94  MB <br> FileReadTime:  8s81ms |\r\n| 50KB | WriteInFileCacheBytes:  6.69  MB <br> FileReadTime:  6s333ms |\r\n| 10KB | WriteInFileCacheBytes:  4.72  MB <br> FileReadTime:  5s877ms |\r\n| dynamic | WriteInFileCacheBytes:  4.54  MB <br> FileReadTime:  5s726ms |\r\n\r\nWhen IO size < 1MB, the performance improvement is not obvious.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.
