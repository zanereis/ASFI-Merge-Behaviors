We lose the information regarding how many tries the call has been tried and how far out we should schedule the call to try again. This could lead to a tight retry loop and put pressure on the brokers.\r\n\r\n*Changes\r\nAdded an overloaded getListOffsetsCalls() to take in the failed call metadata and build call instances' retry number and backoff variables upon the existing getListOffsetsCalls(). The retry calls can then recursively have their retry numbers + 1 and backoffs + x.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\n\r\nUnit tests:\r\n\r\nTest if listOffsets can get the correct offsets for each partition after maxAllowedNumTries times of failed tries\r\nTest if listOffsets will timeout after maxAllowedNumTries + 1 times of failed tries\r\nTest if listOffsets will respect the retry backoff\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-24T21:17:14Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T04:09:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-10T04:09:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"830c5d5213638c75a9aaad20bc5ae4b086fe5580","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8342/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8342/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8342/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/cd13717fe0eff97ca8f189c031f86528cb14e148","head":{"label":"ctan888:KAFKA-9621-2","ref":"KAFKA-9621-2","sha":"cd13717fe0eff97ca8f189c031f86528cb14e148","user":{"login":"ctan888","id":31675100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc1MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31675100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888","html_url":"https://github.com/ctan888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241996119,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDE5OTYxMTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ctan888/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ctan888","id":31675100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc1MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31675100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888","html_url":"https://github.com/ctan888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctan888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ctan888/kafka","description":"Mirror

versions of the JoinGroup rely on a new member timeout to keep the group from growing indefinitely in the case of client disconnects and retrying. The logic for resetting the heartbeat expiration task following completion of the rebalance failed to account for an implicit expectation that `shouldKeepAlive` would return false the first time it is invoked when a heartbeat expiration is scheduled. This patch fixes the issue by making heartbeat satisfaction logic explicit.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

a new `TaskAssignor` implementation, currently hidden behind an internal feature flag, that implements the high availability algorithm of KIP-441. \r\nThe main distinguishing feature of this new assignor is in assigning all active tasks to \"caught-up\" clients (if possible), and instead first assigning a new type of standby task, the \"warmup replica\", to clients who are not caught up.\r\nThe assignor has 4 main steps:\r\n1) stateful active task assignment: gets the initial/actual stateful assignment from `StateConstrainedBalancedAssignor`\r\n2) warmup replica task assignment: gets the final/intended stateful assignment from `BalancedAssignor`, computes the movements between this and the above, and assigns warmup replicas where stateful tasks will ultimately end up\r\n3) standby replica task assignment: distributes the `num.standby` replicas by choosing the next least loaded viable client (ie one that has no active, warmup, or standby version of this task already)\r\n4) stateless active task assignment: distributes the stateless tasks across client, attempts to balance the active task load across all clients  (task load == num tasks per thread)\r\n\r\nNote that step 3) is pretty simple, and loses some of the optimizations used by the `StickyTaskAssignor`. This is mostly to keep this PR small(er), and once merged we should refactor the task assignors to share parts of the standby assignment algorithm (and maybe stateless tasks too)","created_at":"2020-03-24T03:41:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T22:37:45Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T18:36:04Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T18:36:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"2322bc0a6fdf8b26619b6aa9f09355d6c25e6298","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f473f60b99f3b3b2f549b5ae48b2be01fc5cf461","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:KIP-441-implement-assignment-algorithm","ref":"KIP-441-implement-assignment-algorithm","sha":"f473f60b99f3b3b2f549b5ae48b2be01fc5cf461","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

as retriable\r\n\r\nWhen handling a WriteTxnResponse, the TransactionMarkerRequestCompletionHandler throws an IllegalStateException when the remote broker responds with a KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR and does not retry the request. This leaves the transaction state stuck in PendingAbort or PendingCommit, with no way to change that state other than restarting the broker, because both EndTxnRequest and InitProducerIdRequest return CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS if the state is PendingAbort or PendingCommit. This patch changes the error handling behavior in TransactionMarkerRequestCompletionHandler to retry KAFKA_STORAGE_ERRORs. This matches the existing client behavior, and makes sense because KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR causes the host broker to shut down, meaning that the partition being written to will move its leadership to a new, healthy broker.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

the requirement that tasks' reported offsetSum is less than the endOffsetSum for those\r\ntasks. This was surfaced by a test for corrupted tasks, but it can happen with real corrupted\r\ntasks. Rather than throw an exception on the leader, we now de-prioritize the corrupted task.\r\nIdeally, that instance will not get assigned the task and the stateDirCleaner will make \r\nthe problem \"go away\". If it does get assigned the task, then it will detect the corruption and\r\ndelete the task directory before recovering the entire changelog. Thus, the estimate we provide\r\naccurately reflects the amount of lag such a corrupted task would have to recover (the whole log).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

PR fixes three things:\r\n\r\n1.  the state should be closed when standby task is restoring as well\r\n2. the EOS standby task should also wipe out state under dirty close\r\n3. the changelog reader should check for null as well\r\n\r\nThe sequence to reproduce the system test failure:\r\n\r\n1. Stream job close uncleanly, leaving active task 0_0 no committed offset\r\n2. The task 0_0 switch from active to standby task, which never logs anything in checkpoint under EOS\r\n3. Task 0_0 gets illegal state for not finding checkpoints, throwing task corrupted exception\r\n4. Exception were caught and the task was closed, however the state store was already registered, and not released.\r\n5. Next iteration we shall hit lock not available as it never gets released.\r\n6. We shall also hit a NPE in the changelog removal as well since it gets removed in the first time handling corruption of the standby task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

we changed quota communication with KIP-219, fetch requests get throttled by returning empty response with the delay in `throttle_time_ms` and Kafka consumer retries again after the delay. With default configs, the maximum fetch size could be as big as 50MB (or 10MB per partition). The default broker config (1-second window, 10 full windows of tracked bandwidth/thread utilization usage) means that < 5MB/s consumer quota (per broker) may block consumers from being able to fetch any data.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that consumers cannot get blocked by quota by capping `fetchMaxBytes` in KafkaApis.handleFetchRequest() to quota window * consume bandwidth quota. In the example of default configs (10-second quota window) and 1MB/s consumer bandwidth quota, fetchMaxBytes would be capped to 10MB.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

detailed description of your change**\r\n\r\n> In KIP-226, we added the support to change broker defaults dynamically. However, it didn't support changing leader.replication.throttled.replicas and follower.replication.throttled.replicas. These 2 configs were introduced in KIP-73 and controls the set of topic partitions on which replication throttling will be engaged. One useful case is to be able to set a default value for both configs to * to allow throttling to be engaged for all topic partitions. Currently, the static default value for both configs are ignored for replication throttling, it would be useful to fix that as well.\r\n\r\n> leader.replication.throttled.replicas and follower.replication.throttled.replicas are dynamically set through ReplicationQuotaManager.markThrottled() at the topic level. However, these two properties don't exist at the broker level config and BrokerConfigHandler doesn't call ReplicationQuotaManager.markThrottled(). So, currently, we can't set leader.replication.throttled.replicas and follower.replication.throttled.replicas at the broker level either statically or dynamically.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we introduced two new dynamic broker configs, both of them are type of boolean:\r\n\r\n\"leader.replication.throttled\" (default: false)\r\n\r\n\"follower.replication.throttled\" (default: false)\r\n\r\nIf \"leader.replication.throttled\" is set to \"true\", all leader brokers will be throttled. Similarly, if \"follower.replication.throttled\" is set to \"true\", all follower brokers will be throttled. The throttle mechanism is introduced in KIP-73. \r\n\r\nTo implement the broker level throttle, I added a new class variable to ReplicationQuotaManager. The BrokerConfigHandler will call updateBrokerThrottle() and update this class variable upon receiving the config change notification from ZooKeeper. ReplicationQuotaManager::isThrottled()\r\n\r\n**Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)**\r\n\r\nUnit Tests:\r\nAdded ReplicationQuotaManagerTest::shouldBrokerLevelThrottleAffectAllTopicPartition() to test if all topic partitions will be throttled when the broker is throttled.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on adding more unit tests.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests:\r\nStart Kafka and ZooKeeper using localhost, try if the alter config command can successfully change the newly added dynamic configs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-12T06:31:38Z","updated_at":"2024-12-24T03:36:44Z","closed_at":"2024-12-24T03:36:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

`prepareAddPartitions` the txnStartTimestamp could be updated as updateTimestamp, which is assumed to be always larger then the original startTimestamp. However, due to ntp time shift the timer may go backwards and hence the newStartTimestamp be smaller than the original one. Then later in completeTransitionTo the time check would fail with an IllegalStateException, and the txn would not transit to Ongoing.\r\n\r\nAn indirect result of this, is that this txn would NEVER be expired anymore because only Ongoing ones would be checked for expiration.\r\n\r\nWe should do the same as in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3286 to remove this check.\r\n\r\nAlso added test coverage for both KAFKA-5415 and KAFKA-8803.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

if Kafka Connect will create its config backing topic with a fire and forget approach.\r\nThis is fine unless someone has manually created that topic already with the wrong partition count.\r\n\r\nIn such a case Kafka Connect \"may\" run for some time.\r\nEspecially if it's in standalone mode and once switched to distributed mode it will almost certainly fail.\r\n\r\nTo counter this I've added a check when the KafkaConfigBackingStore is starting.\r\nThis check will throw a ConfigException if there is more than one partition in the backing store.\r\n\r\nThis exception is then caught upstream and logged by either:\r\n- class: DistributedHerder, method: run\r\n- class: ConnectStandalone, method: main\r\n\r\nAfter a review I don't believe it impacts any other upstream code.\r\n\r\nFinally, to supper this new functionality I've added a public method to KafkaBasedLog which returns the partition count and a variable to store this.\r\n\r\nAnd, I've created a unit test in KafkaConfigBackingStoreTest to verify the behaviour.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-11T01:32:29Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T19:42:01Z","closed_at":"2020-06-07T19:42:01Z","merged_at":"2020-06-07T19:42:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a0b694a6686d0dc165d7dab54be0f77535582fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b419bb50854965e863abdba9bfd7e07d6efd6929","head":{"label":"Evelyn-Bayes:KAFKA-9216","ref":"KAFKA-9216","sha":"b419bb50854965e863abdba9bfd7e07d6efd6929","user":{"login":"Evelyn-Bayes","id":30654260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU0MjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30654260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes","html_url":"https://github.com/Evelyn-Bayes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Evelyn-Bayes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"d4ef46c69dbc525f55a6d9ae5c9ae6da795f98fb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

Inside StateDirectory#cleanRemovedTasks, skip deleting the lock file (and hence the parent directory) until releasing the lock. And after the lock is released only go ahead and delete the parent directory if `manualUserCall == true`. That is, this is triggered from `KafkaStreams#cleanUp` and users are responsible to make sure that Streams instance is not started and hence there are no other threads trying to grab that lock.\r\n\r\n2. As a result, during scheduled cleanup the corresponding task.dir would not be empty but be left with only the lock file, so effectively we still achieve the goal of releasing disk spaces. For callers of `listTaskDirectories` like KIP-441 (cc @ableegoldman to take a look) I've introduced a new `listNonEmptyTaskDirectories` which excludes such dummy task.dirs with only the lock file left.\r\n\r\n3.

validation API is useful in validating connector configs before starting connector. And our application counts on it to generate friendly feedback to users. However, Connector validation API always log all configs when handling validation request since it creates AbstractConfig to check the overridable configs (introduced by #6624) and AbstractConfig, by default, logs all configs. In our case, the worker logs are filled with the following messages when there are a log of validation requests.\r\n```\r\nINFO AbstractConfig values:\r\nxxx\r\nxxx\r\nxxx\r\n```\r\nIt seems to me the response of Connector validation API is good enough. By contrast, the logs are a bit noisy and useless.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

root cause of the bug is that the statistics object is passed to the RocksDB options after the database is opened. Apparently, the options object is copied during the opening process.

RocksDB's statistics object change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

PR has gone through several significant transitions of its own, but here's the latest:\r\n\r\n1. TaskManager just collects the tasks to transition and refers to the active/standby task creator to handle closing & recycling the old task and creating the new one. If we ever hit an exception during the close, we bail and close all the remaining tasks as dirty.\r\n2. The task creators tell the task to \"close but recycle state\". If this is successful, it tells the recycled processor context and state manager that they should transition to the new type.\r\n3. During \"close and recycle\" the task just does a normal clean close, but instead of closing the state manager it informs it to recycle itself:  maintain all of its store information (most importantly the current store offsets) but unregister the changelogs from the changelog reader\r\n4. The new task will (re-)register its changelogs during initialization, but skip re-registering any stores. It will still read the checkpoint file, but only use the written offsets if the store offsets are not already initialized from pre-transition\r\n5. To ensure we don't end up with manual compaction disabled for standbys, we have to call the state restore listener's `onRestoreEnd` for any active restoring stores that are switching to standbys","created_at":"2020-03-07T05:47:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T22:37:14Z","closed_at":"2020-05-29T17:48:04Z","merged_at":"2020-05-29T17:48:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d52deca247d9e16cf530d655891b2bbe474ffae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/30ac7b3ccd47063497c17ac148d90f9b29683e82","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:KIP-441-fix-standby-to-active-transition","ref":"KIP-441-fix-standby-to-active-transition","sha":"30ac7b3ccd47063497c17ac148d90f9b29683e82","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

So, each thread now encodes only its assigned active and standby tasks, and ignores any already-locked tasks.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there may be unowned and unlocked tasks on disk that were reassigned to another instance and haven't been cleaned up yet by the background thread. Each StreamThread makes a weak effort to lock any such task directories it finds, and if successful is then responsible for computing and reporting that task's offset sum (based on reading the checkpoint file)\r\n\r\nThis PR therefore also addresses two orthogonal issues:\r\n1) Prevent background cleaner thread from deleting unowned stores during a rebalance\r\n2) Deduplicate standby tasks in subscription: each thread used to include every (non-active) task found on disk in its \"standby task\" set, which meant every active, standby, and unowned task was encoded by _every_

ReassignPartitionsCommand to use the KIP-455 API when possible, rather\r\nthan direct communication with ZooKeeper.  Direct ZK access is still supported,\r\nbut deprecated, as described in KIP-555.\r\n\r\nAs specified in KIP-455, the tool has several new flags.  --cancel stops\r\nan assignment which is in progress.  --preserve-throttle causes the\r\n--verify and --cancel commands to leave the throttles alone.\r\n--additional allows users to execute another partition assignment even\r\nif there is already one in progress.  Finally, --show displays all of\r\nthe current partition reassignments.\r\n\r\nReorganize the reassignment code and tests somewhat to rely more on unit\r\ntesting using the MockAdminClient and less on integration testing.  Each\r\nintegration test where we bring up a cluster seems to take about 5 seconds, so\r\nit's good when we can get similar coverage from unit tests.  To enable this,\r\nMockAdminClient now supports incrementalAlterConfigs, alterReplicaLogDirs,\r\ndescribeReplicaLogDirs, and some other APIs.  MockAdminClient is also now\r\nthread-safe, to match the real AdminClient implementation.\r\n\r\nIn DeleteTopicTest, use the KIP-455 API rather than invoking the reassignment\r\ncommand.","created_at":"2020-03-06T19:18:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T03:44:35Z","closed_at":"2020-03-20T03:44:35Z","merged_at":"2020-03-20T03:44:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"56051e763965d439f11f20f876475732eed7b307","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8244/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8244/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8244/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/829a0e60ee0d119833156dc1a781c523a6d43232","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-8820","ref":"KAFKA-8820","sha":"829a0e60ee0d119833156dc1a781c523a6d43232","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror
