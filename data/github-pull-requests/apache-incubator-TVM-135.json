PR allows us to compose dilated conv2d (and depthwise_conv2d) using topi.nn.dilate and topi.nn.conv2d\r\n```python\r\ndilated_kernel = topi.nn.dilate(kernel, (1, 1, dilation_h, dilation_w))\r\nout = topi.nn.conv2d_nchw(data, dilated_kernel, stride, padding)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe definition of conv2d remains unchanged, there is still no dilation field; the schedules are updated to handle dilation. Unlike padding (SAME mode) which depends on kernel size, dilation is logically independent, so it makes sense to compose dilated conv using two separate operators.\r\n\r\nThe only tricky part is to handle dilated conv in extern libs e.g. cudnn and miopen. When using extern libs, dilation and conv will be fused into one operator. This tutorial still works with dilated conv:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/blob/master/tutorials/using_external_lib.py\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-22T21:19:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T16:04:09Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T16:03:59Z","merged_at":"2018-04-25T16:03:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1cf60751e9d5034cee810a3646d87935e622a65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4d4b3a7bf0fb41187de7ee74753103b9c729793e","head":{"label":"Huyuwei:topi","ref":"topi","sha":"4d4b3a7bf0fb41187de7ee74753103b9c729793e","user":{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1788f8ac7592f0d66414010b21c8fa1b73ee9b2e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

Tianqi,\r\nI have a question regarding the unittest in this experimental PR. \r\n\r\nI guess some operators of TensorSlice are illegal and should raise errors.

PR works on two issues to improve the multi-threaded runtime performance on CPUs. \r\n\r\n1. Use atomic variables to coordinate the threads in `ParallelLauncher`.\r\n2. Make `exclude_worker0` true as default, so that task 0 is run by master.\r\n3. Bind master thread to core 0 if `exclude_worker0 == true`. The master thread is not bound when `exclude_worker0 == false`.\r\n\r\nThe overall performance boost on 18-core Intel Skylake is ~20%.","created_at":"2018-03-19T18:31:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T17:42:03Z","closed_at":"2018-03-20T10:13:32Z","merged_at":"2018-03-20T10:13:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"13e63a418cf62d1d97868900f4b900fb5934deb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

problem that this PR addresses is with porting NNVM's build function to C++. The NNVM pass `GraphFuseCompile` makes callbacks to global functions `nnvm.compiler.lower` and `nnvm.compiler.build_target` in order to invoke the TVM compiler. Both of these functions rely on being able to access the BuildConfig context, which is currently stored in python, and not available to C++.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to solve that by moving the context stack into C++. This requires also moving the remaining two pieces of BuildConfig state (`dump_pass_ir` and `add_lower_pass`) into the C++ node so that these aren't lost in a round trip call to get the current BuildConfig.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-19T13:24:42Z","updated_at":"2018-04-01T17:43:07Z","closed_at":"2018-04-01T17:42:55Z","merged_at":"2018-04-01T17:42:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"228e9cc2373edf9a532f6bb96544d41de4d79e5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR implements ComputeVerifier, which verifies the following two properties of ComputeOp:\r\n\r\n(1) All Reduce operations must exist at top level (as described in Issue 848 ).\r\n\r\n(2) For batch operations, if one is Reduce, then the others must be Reduce as well; and their inputs should have the same attribute except value_index. Such check was originally implemented in `ComputeOpNode::make()` and `ComputeOpNode::ReplaceInputs()`; we re-organized the code and moved it into ComputeVerifier
