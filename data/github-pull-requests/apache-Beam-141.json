version number to Java 8 image names (in anticipation of releasing java11 container)\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Changes the output tag/name for the docker container task to `apache/beam_java8_sdk` instead of `apache/beam_java_sdk`\r\n- Adjusts hardcoded/java8-only references to java_sdk to java8_sdk (leaving tackling the changes to allow for versioning to a different PR) \r\n- Removes separate Dockerfile for Java11 and add java_version argument to existing Dockerfile. Changes build command:\r\n\r\nOld:\r\n```\r\n./gradlew :sdks:java:container:docker -Pdockerfile=Dockerfile-java11 ...\r\n```\r\nNew:\r\n```\r\n./gradlew :sdks:java:container:docker -PimageJavaVersion=11 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual difference betweeen Dockerfile-java11 and Dockerfile are minimal - literally these COPY lines:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/63f54fd5a0e90dbbf0fd183ee1b38ca615571d72/sdks/java/container/Dockerfile#L35-L36 \r\n\r\nare the only difference, and I'm pretty sure they should be copied appropriately for the Java11 image as well. \r\n\r\nThings that should be done at submission/after merge:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add new repository to hub.docker.com/apache before next run of release script.\r\n- [x] Send a notice out to dev@ and user@\r\n- [ ] Notify releaser that name of released image will have changed after version 3.XX.00\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nThank you for your contribution!

we substitute all parameters with literals. This works in most cases except when the parameter is NULL, because some operations allows NULL parameter but not NULL literal.\r\n\r\nTherefore here I translate all NULL parameters to a Calcite `RexDynamicParam`, and then rebuild them them during unparsing (it's easy to do because we know they are all NULLs). The reason why I did not implement full support of dynamic parameters is because there are limitations on both Calcite (`RexDynamicParam` only support positional parameters) and ZetaSQL (Java evaluator wrapper only support named parameters) side.\r\n\r\nr: @apilloud \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

16bc9bb: The bulk of the change. Changes external_transform.proto to encode a Schema and a Row, and modifies Java's ExpansionService, and Python's SchemaBasedPayloadBuilders, to use the new representation.\r\n- 5ff29d8: Changes related to KafkaIO. Since KV is not supported in schemas, KafkaIO configuration types are changed to use `Map<String, String>` instead of `List<KV<String, String>>`. Also updates references to external_transform.proto in KafkaIOExternalTest.\r\n- 0ef3701: Updates references to external_transform.proto in PubsubIOExternalTest.\r\n- b8936db: Updates references to external_transform.proto in XVR test fixtures (Java and Python).\r\n\r\nSome notes about the implementation:\r\n- Since KV is not supported by Rows, I've updated the tests that used them in this context to use a Map instead. In many unit tests this is not a true replacement, but I think it's valid since the only application that currently requires KV is encoding a Map as a List<KV>.\r\n- For users of Python's SchemaBasedPayloadBuilder and implementors of Java's ExternalTransformBuilder the change should be transparent (with the exception that they can no longer use KV).\r\n- For ExternalTransformBuilder implementations it is now possible to register a Schema for ConfigT and we will use that to populate an instance rather than the existing setter approach.\r\n- Due to BEAM-10632 I've temporarily added a testCompile dependency on checker framework to :sdks:java:expansion-service so that I can still test the schema inference capability.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Gradle paths always start with a colon. We should stick to that format\r\nalthough we can also parse Gradle paths which do not start with a colon.\r\n\r\nIn order for the Gradle path printed to be valid, we should prefix Gradle path\r\nwith

datatable now displays some info when there is no data and renders\r\ndatatable when data comes in for continuously updated visualization.\r\n\r\nThe problem was:\r\n1. If the pcoll returns empty data for a streaming pipeline, it will cause\r\nthe header of the datatable to container only the index column. \r\n2. The original `update_display` approach cannot modify the HTML part\r\nof the datatable. Later when updating, if data is not empty, new rows are\r\nadded but there are no columns to display those data.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@amaliujia\r\nCC: @kennknowles\r\n\r\nInitialized tpcds module in sdks/java/testing. \r\n\r\nTable schemas and netezza queries are retrieved or generated from official tpc-ds tool and are stored in this module's resource directory. 1G and 10G data are stored in \"apache-beam-testing\" GCP project, at \"beamsql_tpcds_1/data\" bucket. \r\n\r\nCurrently, this module uses dataflow runner to run queries and write the result into \"apache-beam-testing\" project, result files can be found at \"beamsql_tpcds_1/tpcds_result/{%dataSize}/{%jobName}\". JobName is automatically set by combining query name and time stamp.\r\n\r\nTo test execution, set up \"apache-beam-testing\" project authentication and authorization, then run the following command from the command line:\r\n\r\n ./gradlew :sdks:java:testing:tpcds:run -Ptpcds.args=\"--dataSize=1G \\\\\r\n         --queries=3,26,55 \\\\\r\n         --tpcParallel=2 \\\\\r\n         --project=apache-beam-testing \\\\\r\n         --stagingLocation=gs://beamsql_tpcds_1/staging \\\\\r\n         --tempLocation=gs://beamsql_tpcds_2/temp \\\\\r\n         --runner=DataflowRunner \\\\\r\n         --region=us-west1 \\\\\r\n         --maxNumWorkers=10\"\r\n\r\nThis means running query2, query26, query55 on 1G tpcds data set, at most 2 jobs can run in parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

allows loopback mode to be supported in the Go SDK. This is useful for validating pipelines against real portable runners such as Flink, Spark, and the Python Portable runner. \r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some smaller  bugs around logging, discovered through testing.\r\n* Missing newlines when printing unsent log messages to the local machine.\r\n* A small race condition when the control channel terminates prevented orderly shutdown of workers.\r\n* Cleans up [BEAM-9982], and removes the redundant MustMarshal function from graphx.\r\n* Increases the default GRPC recv limit to it's maximum. Testing indicates that this only leads to memory overage if the inputs are actually large, and unnecessarily restricts pipeline data.\r\n\r\nLoopback mode allows for convenient testing of pipelines, such as avoiding needing to dig into running docker VMs to access logs. Print output will appear as expected in the normal console. There are also some testing benefits such as access to the local file system for reading and writing files.\r\n\r\nThe associated risk for this convenience is access to the local state of the program. Package level/global state is accessible in the process, and thus to the local workers. As per best practices, it's best to move DoFn state into Structural DoFns. Otherwise you risk writing pipelines that depend on state that doesn't exist on distributed machines.\r\n\r\nTo use loopback mode, ensure that the runner package you're using is based on the universal runner (such as spark or flink) or use the universal runner directly. You can register the universal runner for use by beamx.Run  by underscore importing it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/x/beamx\"\r\n\r\n\t_ \"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/runners/universal\"\r\n```\r\nthen add the following command lines to your job.\r\n--runner=universal --endpoint=\\<local Job management server instance\\> --environment_type=LOOPBACK\r\n\r\nThis will have the framework start an BeamFnExternalWorkerPoolServer, which will spin up new workers in the main program process, with the runner orchestrating workers in the process as necessary.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
