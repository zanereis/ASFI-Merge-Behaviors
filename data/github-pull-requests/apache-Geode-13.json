group-transaction-events is true\r\n\r\nThe logic for removing events from the Serial Gateway Sender queue\r\nwhen an ack for a batch is received from the gateway receiver\r\nis implemented by the remove() method of the SerialGatewaySenderQueue class.\r\nWhen the group-transaction-events setting is activated, this logic,\r\nneeds to act differently if the event was an event peeked to complete\r\na transaction in a batch than if it is an event peeked with the peekAhead method.\r\nIn the first case, the head key and lastDispatched member must not be\r\nupdated with the key of the event because that could provoke that\r\nevents from the queue not yet retrieved are never retrieved.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the head key and lastDispatched member must be\r\nupdated for a key peeked to complete a transaction (extraPeekedId)\r\nwhen the key with the previous id is removed.\r\nThis was not being done in some cases by the remove() method and it\r\nhas been corrected in this PR.\r\n\r\nSeveral DUnit test cases have been added to test this fix\r\nin a Geode WAN system with a Serial GatewaySender with\r\ngroup-transaction-events set to true. In the test cases, it is verified that\r\nno duplicated events are sent by means of checking that incomplete transactions\r\nare not sent.\r\n\r\nAdditionally to the above change a configurable wait time has been added when\r\ntrying to get events from the queue to complete a transaction in a batch and the number of\r\nretries to get events from the queues is now configurable via the Java API\r\nso that test cases can set a high value to avoid flakyness in results.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is intentionally split into two commits. The first replaces the deprecated junit `assertThat()` with AssertJ assertions throughout the file.

reproduces when following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n\r\n - Redundant partition region must be configured\r\n - Number of servers must be greater than number of redundant copies of partition region\r\n - Parallel gateway sender must be configured on partition region\r\n - Client must register CQs for the region\r\n - Transactions must be used with put operations\r\n - Events must be enqueued in parallel gateway senders (remote site is unavailable)\r\n\r\nServer that is hosting primary bucket will send TXCommitMessage to the secondary\r\nserver, and also to the server that is hosting CQ subscription queue (if CQ condition is fulfilled).\r\nThe problem occurs when the server that is hosting CQ subscription queue does not host\r\nthe bucket for which event is received. In that case the server will store the event in\r\nbucketToTempQueueMap, because it assumes that the bucket is in the process of the\r\ncreation, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\n\r\nAt reception of CommitProcessForTXIdMessage the events received with TXCommitMessage will not\r\nbe stored in temporary queue, if targeted bucket region is not hosted in the server. Following\r\nchecks are performed on receiving server in order to identify those events:\r\n\r\n1. Check that targeted bucket region is not available locally on server\r\n2. Check from filterRoutingInfo that the receiving server hosts CQ/RegionInterests queue for that event\r\n\r\nIf above checks are fulfilled then tailKey is set to -1 on receiving server to avoid enqueuing of\r\nevent in parallel gateway sender temporary queue.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

(very long response\r\ntimes) and also, if operations rate is high, it could prevent\r\nthat the gateway sender is stopped.\r\n\r\nPut operations can be very slow during the grace period\r\nbecause they need to traverse the gateway sender queue\r\nto find events with the same transactionId. If the queue\r\nsize is big and events are evicted to disk, the time to\r\nprocess a request can be unacceptably long.\r\nAt the same time, this can provoke that the gateway sender\r\nis never stopped because it is blocked trying to get\r\na write lock and the lock is held by ongoing operations\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

(very long response\r\ntimes) and also, if operations rate is high, it could prevent\r\nthat the gateway sender is stopped.\r\n\r\nPut operations can be very slow during the grace period\r\nbecause they need to traverse the gateway sender queue\r\nto find events with the same transactionId. If the queue\r\nsize is big and events are evicted to disk, the time to\r\nprocess a request can be unacceptably long.\r\nAt the same time, this can provoke that the gateway sender\r\nis never stopped because it is blocked trying to get\r\na write lock and the lock is held by ongoing operations\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

A** geode user\r\n**I WANT TO** have more information when an IO exception occurs\r\n**SO THAT** I can understand and fix the root cause of the problem\r\n\r\n`GemFireIOException` is used to encapsulate a given `IOException` that happen in the Geode code.\r\nFor creating a `GemFireIOException` when a `IOException` is catched, this constructor is used:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic GemFireIOException(String message, Throwable cause)  {\r\n    super(message, cause);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `IOException` message is not part of the `GemFireIOException` message. So when a `GemFireIOException` is logged, the root cause of the problem is not shown.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following message log message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Cache initialization for GemFireCache[id = 1081136680; isClosing = false; isShutDownAll = false; created = Fri Jun 19 11:42:29 UTC 2020; server = false; copyOnRead = false; lockLease = 120; lockTimeout = 60] failed because: org.apache.geode.GemFireIOException: While starting cache server CacheServer on port=40404 client subscription config policy=none client subscription config capacity=1 client subscription config overflow directory=.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt was logged at `GemFireCacheImpl`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlogger.error(\"Cache initialization for \" + toString() + \" failed because:\", throwable);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the `GemFireIOException` was created in `CacheCreation` in this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n} catch (IOException ex) {\r\n     throw new GemFireIOException(format(\"While starting cache server %s\", impl),

merge the back-port to 1.13 PR [#6626](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6626) before merging this one so we don't run afoul of commit check.\r\n- when merging **be sure to rebase-and-merge** so this is merged as two commits!\r\n\r\nThese two commits were cherry-picked from the support/1.13 back-port PR [#6618](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6618) since that PR had to resolve a number of tricky conflicts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those conflicts I saw on support/1.12, I had to resolve issues with a confounding commit:\r\n\r\nGEODE-8419 \"SSL Configuration ignored\" had been back-ported already to 1.12 but there was an error in that back-port:\r\n\r\n`clientSocket` was still referenced in `SocketCreator.handshakeSSLSocketChannel()`. I removed those remnants since the fix for GEODE-8419 moved all that configuration into `SocketCreator.configureSSLEngine()`. The parameter was removed in GEODE-9141 and in this PR I removed this remnant:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    engine.setUseClientMode(clientSocket);\r\n    if (!clientSocket) {\r\n      engine.setNeedClientAuth(sslConfig.isRequireAuth());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

reproduces when following conditions are fulfilled:\r\n\r\n    Redundant partition region must be configured\r\n    Number of servers must be greater than number of redundant copies of partition region\r\n    Parallel gateway sender must be configured on partition region\r\n    Client must register CQs for the region\r\n    Transactions must be used with put operations\r\n    Events must be enqueued in parallel gateway senders (remote site is unavailable)\r\n\r\nServer that is hosting primary bucket will send TXCommitMessage to the secondary\r\nserver, and also to the server that is hosting CQ subscription queue (if CQ condition is fulfilled).\r\nThe problem occurs when the server that is hosting CQ subscription queue does not host\r\nthe bucket for which event is received. In that case the server will store the event in\r\nbucketToTempQueueMap, because it assumes that the bucket is in the process of the\r\ncreation, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nThe fix:\r\nNormal put operation (transaction is not used) is distributed to adjunct\r\nmember (only host sub. queue, and not bucket) using seperate\r\npartition.PutMessage which indicates that it is notificationOnly, and\r\nalso sets TailKey to -1. Adjunct member will not store event in queue,\r\nbecause TailKey is always expected to be set in case of parallel\r\ngateway-sender. Members that host secondary bucket will receive the\r\nUpdateOperation message with valid TailKey value.\r\n\r\nSo this solution implements the similar approach to what is done in\r\ncase of normal put operation. TxCommitMessage with TailKey set to -1\r\nwill be sent only to adjunct member that host subscription queue, and not\r\nsecondary bucket. Other members will get valid TailKey value. Also,\r\nmember that host both secondary bucket and subscription queue will get\r\nvalid TailKey value.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [*] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

noticed a 4-5x increase in the worst-case P2P send latency (most notably sendReplication) in 1.12 vs 1.8. Further analysis showed that the increase in sendReplicationTime is related to how long it takes to create the sender connection. More specifically, all the time spent creating the sender is in the handshake. Experiments with various sleep durations in NioSslEngine.handshake() method showed that this issue can be fixed by replacing both sleeps handshake() method with Thread.yield() calls.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

- Replace uses of new String(byte[]) and String.getBytes() with\r\n Coder.bytesToString() and Coder.stringToBytes() respectively\r\n - Change bytesToString() and stringToBytes() to use the CHARSET defined\r\n in Coder (UTF-8)\r\n - Throw IllegalStateException if UTF-8 charset is not supported\r\n - Introduce StringBytesGlossary class to hold commonly-used byte array\r\n values to reduce the need to create new Strings\r\n - Replace as many calls to bytesToString() as possible in Executor\r\n classes with byte array comparisons using StringBytesGlossary values\r\n - Introduce methods in

to the Geode User Guide, it is possible to set the write buffer size by using the `--write-buffer-size` option when creating a disk store.\r\nNevertheless, setting a value for that parameter either by using gfsh, cache.xml or the `DiskStoreFactory.setWriteBuffer()` method has no effect.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation checks if the `WRITE_BUF_SIZE` system property is set, and if that is not the case, the default value of `32768` bytes is used.\r\nThis PR changes the behavior so first the disk store write buffer size is obtained (which default value is `32768`).
