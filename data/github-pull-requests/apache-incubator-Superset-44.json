SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24266 is failing as—for some unknown reason—the `can_slice` permission is missing. It turns out—thanks to help from @michael-s-molina—that the permission is unused (outside of testing).

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR will make it so that dashboard native filters are properly copied when copying a dashboard using the \"Save as\" option in the UI.  This functionality broke as a result of an [api v1 migration](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23112).\r\n\r\n`set_dash_metadata` just takes the current dash's params and adds certain keys from the data dict passed in.  Before calling `set_dash_metadata`, the newly copied dashboard should share the same metadata as the original dash so that no keys are lost, in this case `native_filter_configuration` was being lost.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![copy_dash_filters_before](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/47196419/291771f1-c2ca-475f-b8b2-2e018f5091f6)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![copy_dash_filters_after](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/47196419/596cf5f0-f913-4f5b-962a-883f51333b91)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, when a user tries to access a shared query link created by another user, they cannot access the query and only see a \"This query couldn't be loaded\" toast.  This was caused by [this PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21682/files#diff-1fe9f23910bda67f66ff7b5e9127cdaba0d304153a5246dbcb2d76d70d2e5a4fR1365), which updated the endpoint used to fetch the query.  The new endpoint currently only allows users to fetch their own saved queries, while the old one allowed any.\r\n\r\nMy solution to this is to also allow looking up a saved query by its UUID for non-creators so that we can more securely enable sharing saved queries in the v1 API.\r\n\r\nI also formally marked the old APIs as deprecated for removal in 4.0 and replaced its final usage with the v1 API\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nBeen working in Github Codespaces for a while now, and wanted to create new make commands to make it easier for folks to spin up s2 in the same envs. The idea here is we start to make more intelligent recipes in our makefiles that can handle failures and run the right command with devs having to figure it out on themselves\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# installs all necessary requirements\r\n$ make install\r\n\r\n# starts postgres instance + starts flask app\r\n$ make api \r\n\r\n# spins up node app\r\n$ make client

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis bumps `typescript` from `4.5.4` to `4.8.4`. `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` were upgraded to `5.42.1` to match the typescript version.\r\n\r\nNew TSERRORs were fixed where possible. Unfortunately, I had to add a few `@ts-ignore`s here and there. Maybe someone with a deeper understanding of the code base is able to fix these errors properly.\r\n\r\nI decided to bump to typescript 4.8.4 as work related to https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/21758 introduced an upgrade to this version anyways. In consultation with @villebro we decided to create a dedicated PR for this.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR partially addresses Superset 3.0 task [#9](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/201/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=17888789) by removing the previous deprecated `ENABLE_ACCESS_REQUEST` config parameter and the associated workflows.\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is this legacy workflow failed to work post https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22022 (which mentions that the API endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in 3.0) when the `GET` requests became `POST` requests meaning logic like [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/9df8d8dda538095ba3b30d1f82aa81acf17e1c95/superset/views/core.py#L1903-L1905) and [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/9df8d8dda538095ba3b30d1f82aa81acf17e1c95/superset/views/core.py#L902-L906) is currently broken.\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm going in somewhat blind in terms of the how/where this logic was used, but the TL;DR is there _seems_ to be no approval logic/workflow if there's no request workflows. Hopefully I've trimmed enough dead code without over pruning, though this has turned somewhat into a yak shaving exercise as—by deleting the `/approve` endpoint—it led to removing facets of role extension, deleting the `granter` role, etc.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdds a configuration option to change the default language of time related data on charts, including the option to translate months. This is related to issues: #3972 , https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13442 and https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17447.\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation I had to change how the smart formatters were used across the application, because I had to ensure that they were instantiated with the right locale configuration. So instead of importing them directly, I got them through the TimeFormatterRegistry. I'm not sure if is the best option, let me know.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nWithout time format configuration:\r\n![Captura de tela de 2023-06-01 09-49-00](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14370340/facbbc2d-04b2-47d4-8240-472c85455bff)\r\n\r\nWith brazilian portuguese time format configuration:\r\n![Captura de tela de 2023-06-01 09-47-58](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14370340/e627ab9e-444c-4f32-bdee-34b32348c38b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nAdd the `D3_TIME_FORMAT` with your locale configuration to `superset_config.py` following the definition expected by D3 ([docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/main#locales)), for example, this is the definition for brazilian portuguese:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nD3_TIME_FORMAT = {\r\n  \"dateTime\": \"%A, %e de %B de

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR enables `TALISMAN_ENABLED` by default and provides a default content security policy config.\r\nPlease keep in mind that this is a **breaking change**. If your Superset deployment loads additional scripts, loads images from external domains, performs HTTP requests to external domains, you need to adjust the default CSP config by adding external origins to appropriate CSP directives and/or mark the scripts with nonce as described in the updated docs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEnable strong session protection by default. This is a more secure sane default, more details on: https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#session-protection\r\n\r\n\r\n> When session protection is active, each request, it generates an identifier for the user’s computer (basically, a secure hash of the IP address and user agent). If the session does not have an associated identifier, the one generated will be stored. If it has an identifier, and it matches the one generated, then the request is OK.\r\nIf the identifiers do not match in basic mode, or when the session is permanent, then the session will simply be marked as non-fresh, and anything requiring a fresh login will force the user to re-authenticate. (Of course, you must be already using fresh logins where appropriate for this to have an effect.)\r\nIf the identifiers do not match in strong mode for a non-permanent session, then the entire session (as well as the remember token if it exists) is deleted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nMySQL returns `DECIMAL` typed values as strings, rather than `Decimal` or `float`. This causes issues in the frontend, as most plugins expect `GenericDataType.NUMERIC` values to be of type `number`, not `string`. To get around this we introduce a new property `column_type_mutators` on `BaseEngineSpec`, where type-specific callbacks can be introduced to mutate the results coming back from the database. Here we implement logic on the MySQL spec to change string-based decimals to `Decimal`, similar to what Postgres already does automatically (I assume most connectors do the same).\r\n\r\nThe new logic can be expensive for big datasets, due to the need to iterate over the full result set. For this reason the for-loop is only triggered if there are columns present that need to be mutated.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the Big Number chart works as expected on Trino Decimal types (notice the value is now `number` in the response payload):\r\n<img width=\"1429\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/61991332-9f21-4aaf-9493-29a9b9ad84a0\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously Big Number chart would display \"No data\" due to the data type being `string`:\r\n<img width=\"1429\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/015ab5a8-3b40-4c39-b22d-56a17fcd648c\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Revert back to v2 resolved the issue and the connection works correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso, other packages lack version constrain in the same doc, should I also update them?

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently only Admins have \"menu access on Security\", but despite that, non-admins have \"menu access on User's Statistics\" and \"menu access on \"User Registrations\" which belong under the \"Security\" menu.

We also bump FAB to the lastest version, which includes a fix to the \"User Registrations\" view registration: https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/pull/2051\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter the change, a Gamma user with Alerts & Reports and RLS access will only see the RLS menu under Security:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/79d8b2cf-d5f0-42aa-a2f6-d7fd3858a507)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, they would also see the User Registrations menu:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/190af523-3ac3-4d3d-92dc-c34a2e771c6a)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

merit in \"keeping up with the Joneses\"  in terms of ensuring our Python code is inline with the evolution of the language.\r\n\r\n[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) is a tool (and pre-commit hook) to automatically upgrade syntax for newer versions of the language. This PR adds said pre-commit hook (in addition to `pycln` which removes unused imports) to help ensure your code style format is fresh. \r\n\r\nApologies for the scale of the change. I wasn't able to find any setting in `pyupgrade` to make this more digestible, unless we opted to incrementally set the minimum Python requirement.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixing issue with SSH tunnel creation with dynamic forms. Main issue was the ssh toggle would lose state, and validate_parameters endpoints would fail immediately since no tunnel is created on every `onBlur` event\r\n\r\nTo fix it I refactored the toggle state to the reducer, and stop validation on any ssh tunnel requests to connect to a DB\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen choosing \"Log axis\" for a set of series that contain zero values, the y-axis is fixed to the interval 1-10, despite values being in excess of 10. To get around this limitation, we calculate the best lower bound for the chart by recording the lowest positive series value on the chart and set the minimum based on that if undefined. This appears to be how Google Sheets does it; the resulting chart in GS is very similar to the one that this solution produces. Note, that if the user wishes to specify a custom lower bound, that will be used.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nFor a series with the lowest defined value at approx. 400, the lower tick mark is set to 100:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/ca600117-e2ea-4f26-a61c-2826e5db4ac2)\r\nIf a min bound is specified, the calculated lower bound is not used:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/f82da012-dff7-4184-a0ea-b1594a559277)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, the y-axis would be fixed to 1-10:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/25ae77c4-a4d3-4b13-a1d1-e847d70ae582)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere's an option in the Advanced Analytics section of Explore called Time Shift that allows an user to compare the query results with the same query dislocated in time by the amount specified in the control. The way this is implemented, is to fire a query for each specified Time Shift and later join the results with the original query. To make the join work the algorithm modifies the temporal column of the time shift results to match the one in the original query. The problem is that the algorithm is not taking into account that the time granularity and time shifts can influence on the temporal column and affect the resulting timestamps. For example, if the Time Grain is Quarter and Time Shift is 28 days, the results could have different timestamps but still belong to the same quarter. Another example is when the Time Grain is Week and after applying the time shifts, the results fall in a different year which may produce different week numbers for the timestamps. The objective of this PR is to fix these problems by generating an artificial join key that takes into consideration the Time Grain when joining the results.\r\n\r\nThe following table illustrates how the join keys are calculated depending on the Time Grain:\r\n\r\nTime Grain | Join key\r\n-- | --\r\nWeek | year-week\r\nMonth | year-month\r\nQuarter | year-quarter\r\nYear | year\r\n\r\nThis join key is only used when joining the results and is discarded in the end.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the Python codebase by creating a `TimeGrain` class and replacing all string literals with references to the new class.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1774\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 13 24 36\"

PR adds an Engine Spec for [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) a timeseries database.\r\n\r\nThe original Spec resides within module [questdb-connect](https://github.com/questdb/questdb-connect) and has been tested against Apache Superset 2.0 by the following means:\r\n\r\n- clone this repo\r\n- configure a secret key\r\n- create file `docker/requirements-local.txt` with content\r\n   ```shell\r\n   questdb-connect>=1.0.8\r\n   ```\r\n- docker-compose up\r\n- then I start a QuestDB instance [https://questdb.io/docs/](https://questdb.io/docs/)\r\n- and I can reach it and play with it through URL `questdb://admin:quest@host.docker.internal:8812/main` defined as an OTHER connection\r\n\r\nWith this PR we would like to migrate the Engine Spec from the `questdb-connect` repo to `superset's`, as well as to enable a drop down from superset's UI so that users can select QUESTDB rightaway rather than configuring the connection through OTHER.","created_at":"2023-05-22T12:25:56Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T18:35:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329338104,"node_i

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR #23888  that migrated serialization of permalink entries from Pickle to JSON caused a regression when decoding permalinks containing URL params. More specifically, this happened due to the fact that we were encoding the value with a JSON codec, which doesn't distinguish between tuples and lists. As the `urlParams` property in the permalink state was of the format `Optional[List[Tuple[str, str]]]`, they became `Optional[List[List[str]]]` after deserialization, which `urllib.parse.urlencode` is unable to process.\r\n\r\nTo get around this we introduce a new codec called `MarshmallowKeyValueCodec`. This extends the `JsonKeyValueCodec` but takes a Marshmallow Schema in the constructor, and uses that during encoding/decoding. This ensures that an entry that has been serialized in JSON format can contain tuples after decoding.\r\n \r\nThanks @Always-prog for raising this issue in #24160.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow permalinks containing `urlParams` work as expected:\r\n<img width=\"1305\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/2d6d5fb0-e2b3-4c67-96b3-e0dfd345e149\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously permalinks with URL params would throw a 500:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"errors\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"message\": \"not a valid non-string sequence or mapping object\", \r\n      \"error_type\": \"GENERIC_BACKEND_ERROR\", \r\n      \"level\": \"error\",\r\n      \"extra\": {\r\n        \"issue_codes\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"code\": 1011, \r\n            \"message\": \"Issue 1011 - Superset encountered an unexpected error.\"\r\n           }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.
