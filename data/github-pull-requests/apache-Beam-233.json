decision to make a unified pre/post serialization API. We could simply not have one if we follow this workflow:\r\n\r\n - serde the pipeline (now nodes have only `RawPTransform`)\r\n - perform surgery\r\n - serde the pipeline (`RawPTransform` \"just works\" and all \"fresh\" nodes from surgery now also contain `RawPTransform`)\r\n - run\r\n\r\nJust musing. This latter world means that pseudo-primitives all need registered payloads. I don't totally love this, because they may contain a bunch of stuff specific to the language of the runner and it is just boilerplate to give them payloads.","created_at":"2017-06-01T23:21:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T21:25:51Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T20:28:30Z","merged_at":"2017-06-06T20:28:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b00d95a1105d2611b985dc463da0884a6646354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1b00d95a1105d2611b985dc463da0884a6646354","head":{"label":"kennknowles:Splittable-ParDo-translation","ref":"Splittable-ParDo-translation","sha":"1b00d95a1105d2611b985dc463da0884a6646354","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

Interface in `BeamRelNode` is changed, to align with the goal, converting into PTransform;\r\n\r\nThe methods for CLI client are marked as `Experimental` in `BeamSql`, the difference is handled in
