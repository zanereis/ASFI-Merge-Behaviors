Updated Geode's build system to use Gradle 6.8.3:\r\n\r\n- Updated the gradle wrapper to use Gradle 6.8.3.\r\n- Updated geode-assembly/build.gradle to make the ivy \"repository\"\r\n  compatible with Gradle 6.8.3.\r\n- Changed ./gradle.properties to specify 'minimumGradleVersion=6.8'.\r\n- Updated the expected-pom.xml file to the format that Gradle 6.8.3\r\n  produces.\r\n- Updated all Gradle plugins to the latest versions.\r\n- In buildSrc/build.gradle, added groovy source sets for testing, to\r\n  allow running tests of plugin code.\r\n- Updated common \"test isolation\" code to be compatible with Gradle\r\n  6.8.3. See below for details.\r\n- Updated the RepeatTest task to be compatible with Gradle 6.8.3. See\r\n  below for details.\r\n- Rewrote the Dockerized test plugin to be compatible with Gradle 6.8.3.\r\n  See below for details.\r\n- Added a new 'dunitDockerJVM' project property to allow developers run\r\n  tests in Docker on macOS. To do this, use -PtestJVM to identify the\r\n  mac's JVM, and use -PdunitDockerJVM to specify the JVM for the test\r\n  worker process running in Docker.\r\n- Updated the BUILDING.md file for Gradle 6.8.3. As part of this I added\r\n  two versions of the Apache copyright notice to the etc dir: A plain\r\n  text version and an xml version that IntelliJ IDEA can import into its\r\n  copyright settings.\r\n\r\n# Test isolation code\r\n\r\nSome code for isolating tests is used by the RepeatTest task and the\r\nDockerized test plugin. This code was updated to be compatible with\r\nGradle v6.8.3, and to somewhat reduce its dependence on Gradle internal\r\nimplementation details:\r\n\r\n- WorkingDirectoryIsolator adjusts a given ProcessBuilder to give it a\r\n  unique working directory.\r\n- AdjustableProcessLauncher applies a given Consumer (such as the\r\n  isolator, above) to adjust each ProcessBuilder before launching the\r\n  process.\r\n- LauncherProxyWorkerProcessBuilder and\r\n  LauncherProcessWorkerProcessFactory forcefully update each Gradle exec\r\n  handle to use a given ProcessLauncher to launch test worker processes.\r\n- Executers and Workers offer convenience methods for constructing\r\n  TestExecuters and ProcessWorker builders and factories.\r\n\r\n# RepeatTest task update\r\n\r\nGeode's RepeatTest task uses a custom TestExecuter that was copied from\r\nGradle 5.5 (or earlier) and modified. This custom class is now updated\r\nto be compatible with Gradle 6.8.3, and renamed from\r\nOverriddenTestExecutor to RepeatableTestExecuter.\r\n\r\n# Dockerized test plugin rewrite\r\n\r\nRemoved the modified copy of pedjak's Dockerized test plugin.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n- Rewrote gradle/docker.gradle and renamed it as\r\n  gradle/multi-process-test.gradle.\r\n- Moved the code that translates project properties into configuration\r\n  settings from the plugin to the config class. Renamed the config class\r\n  as DockerTestWorkerConfig.\r\n- Moved code that configures command lines and environments for Docker\r\n  test workers based on project properties. Thise code was defiend as a\r\n  closure in a build script. It is now a method in\r\n  DockerTestWorkerConfig.\r\n- Changed command line options that CI scripts pass to Gradle to run\r\n  tests in Docker:\r\n    - Specify the --max-workers Gradle option to configure the maximum\r\n      number of workers.\r\n    - Specify the 'testMaxParallelForks' project property to configure\r\n      the maximum number of forks for each test task.\r\n    - Remove the 'dunitParallelForks' option.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nThe Dockerized test plugin uses these classes to launches processes in\r\nDocker containers:\r\n\r\n- DockerProcess overrides java.lang.Process to represent a test worker\r\n  process running in Docker.\r\n- DockerProcessLauncher launches each test worker process in a Docker\r\n  container, and creates a DockerProcess to represent and manage it.\r\n- Other classes described in the \"Test isolation code\" section, above.\r\n\r\nThe plugin overrides several of Gradle's internal classes to allow test\r\nworker processes running in Docker containers to communicate with\r\nGradle:\r\n\r\n- DockerConnectionAcceptor implements Gradle's ConnectionAcceptor, which\r\n  (among other responsibilities), produces a \"multi-choice address\" that\r\n  a test worker process can use to connect to Gradle's messaging server.\r\n  Gradle's default implementation produces multi-choice addresses that\r\n  processes in Docker containers cannot use.\r\n- DockerMessagingServer implements Gradle's MessagingServer using\r\n  DockerConnectionAcceotpr.\r\n- WildcardBindingInetAddressFactory overrides Gradle's\r\n  InetAddressFactory to instruct messaging servers to listen on an\r\n  address that processes in Dockerized containers can connect to.\r\n\r\n## Timeouts\r\nDue to a recent surge of CI problems due to delays in Docker operations,\r\nI rewrote the plugins's timeout mechanism to make it configurable and\r\nmuch more robust:\r\n\r\n- Added a 'dockerTimeout' project property, defaulting to 5 minutes.\r\n  Each Docker operation will throw an exception if its duration exceeds\r\n  this value.\r\n- Log a warning if any Docker operation takes longer than 1 minute. This\r\n  can help us to see how often significant delays occur in CI, while\r\n  still allowing tests to proceed.\r\n- These exceptions and warnings identify the project for which test\r\n  worker process is being launched. This can help us to see whether\r\n  there are project-specific factors that affect the delays.","created_at":"2021-04-07T19:48:21Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T19:37:36Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T17:10:14Z","merged_at":"2021-04-12T17:10:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"75bb0d297b0624120fd62bea2ee9d5dfc400a18f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dickcav","id":1934150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzQxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1934150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav","html_url":"https://github.com/dickcav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/5a15ab0e08e3c34264859de316073e55708f8240","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:geode-8899/gradle-6.8","ref":"geode-8899/gradle-6.8","sha":"5a15ab0e08e3c34264859de316073e55708f8240","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":

in which map fields are involved\r\nin the condition, sometimes do not return the same entries\r\nif map indexes are used, compared to when map indexes\r\nare not used.\r\n\r\nDifferences were found when the condition on the\r\nmap field was of type '!=' and also when the condition\r\non the map field was comparing the value with null.\r\n\r\nExample1:\r\nRunning a query with the following condition:\r\npositions['SUN'] = null\r\n\r\nin a region with the following entries:\r\nentry1.positions=null\r\nentry2.positions={'a'=>'b'}\r\nentry3.positions={'SUN'=>null}\r\n\r\n- will return entry1 and entry3 if there are no\r\n  indexes defined.\r\n- will return no entries if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions['SUN','c']\r\n- will return entry3 if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions[*]\r\n\r\nExample2:\r\nRunning a query with the following condition:\r\npositions['SUN'] != '3'\r\n\r\nin a region with the following entries:\r\nentry1.positions=null\r\nentry2.positions={'a'=>'b'}\r\nentry3.positions={'SUN'=>'4'}\r\nentry4.positions={'SUN'=>'3'}\r\nentry5.positions={'SUN'=>null}\r\n\r\n- will return all entries except for entry4 if:\r\n  there are no indexes defined.\r\n- will return entry3 if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions['SUN','c']\r\n- will return entry3 and entry5 if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions[*]\r\n\r\nIn order to have the same results for these\r\nqueries no matter if indexes are used,\r\nthe following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n- When using compact map indexes or map indexes\r\nan index entry will be created for every entry\r\nadded to the region even if the entry does not\r\ncontain the indexed map (the map is null) or\r\nit does not contain any of the indexed keys.\r\nThe above will not apply to indexes of type\r\n\"allkeys\" (e.g. positions[*]).\r\n\r\n- As a consequence of the statement above\r\nabout indexes of type \"allkeys\", when the index\r\nconfigured is of \"allkeys\" type and the query\r\nis of type \"!=\" (e.g. positions['SUN'] != \"3\"\r\nor the query is comparing against a null value\r\n(e.g. positions['SUN'] = null) the index will\r\nnot be used.\r\nThis is a limitation of this solution\r\nas allowing the index to be used in this case\r\nwould require bigger and more complex changes that\r\nhave not been considered in this solution.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been

CI scripts to support running parallel DUnit tests with either\r\nGeode's current Gradle 5.5 build or the upcoming Gradle 6.8.3 build.\r\nThis allows testing the upgrade to Gradle 6.8.3 in the PR precheckin\r\npipeline.\r\n\r\nWhere the current build uses a single command line option\r\n(-PdunitParallelForks) to specify the maximum number of parallel\r\ndockerized test workers, the upcoming build uses two (--max-workers and\r\n-PtestMaxParallelForks).\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the CI build scripts to specify all three options on\r\nthe Gradle command line for parallel DUnit tests. With this commit:\r\n\r\n- If the scripts run a Gradle 5.5 build, the old option will configure\r\n  the tests, and the new options will have no effect.\r\n\r\n- If the scripts run a Gradle 6.8.3 build, the new options will\r\n  configure the tests, and the old option will have no effect.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Dale Emery <demery@vmware.com>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

in which map fields are involved\r\nin the condition, sometimes do not return the same entries\r\nif map indexes are used, compared to when map indexes\r\nare not used.\r\n\r\nDifferences were found when the condition on the\r\nmap field was of type '!=' and also when the condition\r\non the map field was comparing the value with null.\r\n\r\nExample1:\r\nRunning a query with the following condition:\r\npositions['SUN'] = null\r\n\r\nin a region with the following entries:\r\nentry1.positions=null\r\nentry2.positions={'a'=>'b'}\r\nentry3.positions={'SUN'=>null}\r\n\r\n- will return entry1 and entry3 if there are no\r\n  indexes defined.\r\n- will return no entries if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions['SUN','c']\r\n- will return entry3 if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions[*]\r\n\r\nExample2:\r\nRunning a query with the following condition:\r\npositions['SUN'] != '3'\r\n\r\nin a region with the following entries:\r\nentry1.positions=null\r\nentry2.positions={'a'=>'b'}\r\nentry3.positions={'SUN'=>'4'}\r\nentry4.positions={'SUN'=>'3'}\r\nentry5.positions={'SUN'=>null}\r\n\r\n- will return all entries except for entry4 if:\r\n  there are no indexes defined.\r\n- will return entry3 if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions['SUN','c']\r\n- will return entry3 and entry5 if the following index is defined:\r\n  positions[*]\r\n\r\nIn order to have the same results for these\r\nqueries no matter if indexes are used,\r\nthe following changes have been made:\r\n- When running queries, the result of getting the\r\nvalue from a Map that does not contain the key used\r\nto access the value will be\r\nconsidered UNDEFINED instead of null.\r\nThis will imply that queries where the condition is\r\npositions['SUN'] = null will not return entries\r\nthat do not have the 'SUN' key in the positions Map.\r\n\r\n- Queries with map indexes will not be able to use\r\nthe indexes if the query is of type '!=' against\r\nany of the indexed map fields.\r\nExample:\r\nfor index positions['SUN', 'ERIC'] or\r\npositions[*]\r\nthe following query will not use indexes:\r\npositions['SUN'] != '44'\r\n\r\nThese changes must be documented accordingly\r\nin the corresponding indexes section.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the

is used\r\n\r\nThe issue:\r\n\r\nStatistics for gets and misses in CachePerfStats is not incremented when get operation\r\nis executed on server as a part of transaction to retrieve value from the locally hosted bucket.\r\nThe problem is that PartitionRegion#endGet method is overridden to do nothing, and therefore\r\nstatistics in not updated when that method is called for this particular case. It is wrongly stated there\r\nin comment that the BucketRegion#endGet will be eventually called and statistics incremented.\r\n\r\nThe fix:\r\n\r\nThe solution is to actually increment the statistics in PartitionRegion#endGet method.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes are made to keep the design base behavior:\r\n  - increment miss on server when netSearch and netLoad is successfully performed\r\n  - increment miss on client when data is fetched from remote server (LocalRegion#findObjectInSystem)\r\n  - increment miss on server when data is fetched from remote bucket (PartitionedRegion#getRemotely)\r\n\r\nDesign base behavior is changed for the case when data is retrieved by using local cache loader. \r\nIn that case miss statistics will not be incremented.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

these 2 fixes together as both of them change the same class (GMSMembership)\r\n\r\nGEODE-7245:\r\n\r\nThis change replaces most uses of `latestViewReadLock` with a volatile read of the `latestView`.\r\nIt also makes access to `shutdownMembers` synchronized. Currently, modification of `shutdownMembers` is done under a sync but access isn't synchronized.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit [477ffba](https://github.com/apache/geode/commit/477ffba8e155dca0bdeeefd312b6b32b4b481100))\r\n\r\nGEODE-8972:\r\n\r\nThis change removes the `shunnedMembers` collection from `GMSMembership` that is used to track the IDs of nodes that are no longer part of the cluster. This collection is no longer needed since we can tell if a node is old by comparing the view ID in its identifier to that of the current view (called `latestView` in that class).\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit [c2fc107](https://github.com/apache/geode/commit/c2fc107bad1de221157072470e2a6ad426533f20))\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
