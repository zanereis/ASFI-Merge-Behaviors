- https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/layout-conversion-pass/4009\r\n\r\nRefactored to share code between AlterOpLayout and ConvertLayout pass.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable refactoring. Following description might help\r\n\r\n* Older `alter_op_layout.h` is renames as `infer_layout_util.h` that contains only the FInferCorrect Related methods.\r\n* `transform_layout.h` has now several methods from older `alter_op_layout.cc`. The idea is to put the shared code among AlterOpLayout and ConvertLayout pass in `transform_layout.h`.\r\n* Both AlterOpLayout and ConvertLayout use FForwardRewrite. FForwardRewrite accepts a context. This context now has a transform function which is specialized for ConvertOpLayout and AlterOpLayout separately. For example, ConvertOpLayout context-transform function extracts op's \"FTVMConvertOpLayout\" attribute, and and sends the user-supplied-desired layout to the packed function.","created_at":"2019-11-14T04:48:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-26T20:45:59Z","closed_at":"2019-12-26T19:15:46Z","merged_at":"2019-12-26T19:15:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"73dda6be503922da4a3861f5a48718f6d7b2ef1a","assignee":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4335/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4335/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4335/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f930b23659f22bf2a7b349dc03a208def3bd0f11","head":{"label":"anijain2305:convert_layout","ref":"convert_layout","sha":"f930b23659f22bf2a7b349dc03a208def3bd0f11","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":150320249,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTAzMjAyNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"anijain2305/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://githu

so we can determine if a tensor array is homogeneous or not. If true, we will directly extract the tensor out of the `tensor_t` object, and it will eliminate the trouble of reading from `tensor_t`.\r\n\r\nWe should do the same optimization in the future when we

recent commit for https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4281 is calling the Win32 MACRO InetPton.  If the Visual studio project is set to \"Use Unicode Character Set\", (which tvm.dll seems to be) this calls InetPtonW, which uses wchar_t* (aka PCWSTR).  This causes a build error as the \"addr_buf\" is a char*.\r\n\r\nFrom [InetPton ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2tcpip/nf-ws2tcpip-inetptonw)docs:\r\n\r\n> When UNICODE or _UNICODE is defined, InetPton is defined to InetPtonW, the Unicode version of this function. The pszAddrString parameter is defined to the PCWSTR data type.\r\n> \r\n> When UNICODE or _UNICODE is not defined, InetPton is defined to InetPtonA, the ANSI version of this function. The ANSI version of this function is always defined as inet_pton. The pszAddrString parameter is defined to the PCSTR data type.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by directly calling InetPtonA, which is safe as the tvm function always uses a char* for add_str and InetPtonA always takes a char* (aka PCSTR)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-11T19:21:48Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T16:50:29Z","closed_at":"2019-11-12T16:50:07Z","merged_at":"2019-11-12T16:50:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"2571449ee3b4cfb36a4eac6a3d1e597a7c7e209f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

 This PR is to fix #4263\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, I found this operation has been implemented in relay cc codes and been working in keras frontend. For tensorflow frontend, only python part is missing. So this PR only to fix the python part. \r\n\r\nThe conv2d_transpose implementation is similar with the conv2d op, beside the following differences,\r\n1) Its name in tensorflow graph definition is 'Conv2DBackpropInput'\r\n2) Its inputs order: 0 -- \"conv2d_transpose/input_sizes\", 1 -- weight,  2 -- input_placeholder\r\n3) It needs an extra input parameter \"output_shape\"\r\n\r\nThe PR implementation is reusing _conv() function and adding the conditions to handle the below differences.","created_at":"2019-11-11T03:43:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T08:29:49Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T01:24:45Z","merged_at":"2019-11-18T01:24:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"2baf310e9833266c4c85d1ded585dd00733ed1e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

RPC is very useful for embedded devices, which can not have Python environment easily. And thanks @siju-samuel ' great work, based on https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/1756, we could get C++ RPC work on these embedded devices. I want to summary some different places compared that PR.\r\n\r\n- The users could only use **libtvm_runtime**, doesn't need to link libtvm. This requirement is the same as deployment.\r\n- Previous PR could not work well and process can not exist normally. We write one method named as `waitpid_eintr` to handle it, we also modify the incorrect argument from `--timeout` to `-timeout`.\r\n- Fix the logic of `GetCmdOption`. Previous PR can not work well like `--key=mtk6763`, which will recognize the second `k`.\r\n- Fix the logic of `GetPath`. In our python api, we could add one argument to specify where we would like to place the deployed .so\r\n\r\nOthers small changes are not listed.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot of work example:\r\n\r\nDevice:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7287321/68450653-bfe9ba00-0226-11ea-95ba-768a733ce11c.png)\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7287321/68455613-c2541000-0236-11ea-97f7-abea7366663b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter

am working on improving the performance of Int8 conv on Raspberry Pi 3.\r\n\r\nFor Conv2D, there is an upcast from int8 to int32 before performing the dot-product. ARM ISA has an instruction called vmlal.s16 that takes 3  SIMD registers each containing 4 16-bit values and does FMA producing 1  SIMD register containing 4 32-bit values. However, LLVM (4.0, 6.0 and 8.0) is not able to efficiently use this instruction.

merged PR #4260  fixes the padding issue when building Winograd conv2d for CUDA, but we found the kernel size is still a problem.\r\n\r\nThe constraints of using Winograd on CUDA has been released in the previous PR #3553. Specifically, the original Winograd limits the kernel size (=3x3), padding (=1x1) and strides (=1x1). PR #3553 released them to square kernel size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, 7x7), strides (=1x1), and arbitrary padding.\r\n\r\nHowever, even PR #4260 fixes the miscalculation issue caused by padding size, the miscalculation caused by kernel size is still there. Here is a code snippet in `conv2d_winograd.py` after PR #4260:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    if not pre_computed: # kernel tensor is raw tensor, do strict check\r\n        if dilation_h != 1 or dilation_w != 1:\r\n            kernel = dilation(kernel, (1, 1, dilation_h, dilation_w))\r\n        CO, CI, KH, KW = get_const_tuple(kernel.shape)\r\n        assert HSTR == 1 and WSTR == 1 and KH == KW\r\n    else:\r\n        # kernel tensor is pre-transfomred. this op is created by alter op layout.\r\n        # dilation is not supported\r\n        _, _, CI, CO = get_const_tuple(kernel.shape)\r\n        KH = KW = 3\r\n        assert HSTR == 1 and WSTR == 1 and dilation_h == 1 and dilation_w == 1\r\n```\r\nAs can be seen, kernel size is forced to 3x3 in the pre-computed case, but it could be any size according to PR #3553. This PR supports the kernel size recovery as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nalpha, _, CI, CO = get_const_tuple(kernel.shape)\r\nKH = KW = alpha + 1 - tile_size\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is another pending issue that I haven't resolved in this PR: the fixed errors in #4260 as well as this PR should be detected by the unit tests but they weren't. The reaons is that the unit test doesn't cover the part with `pre_computed=True`, but I have no idea how to cover it.\r\n\r\n@cbalint13 @vinx13 could you review and suggest how to improve the unit test?

PR adds support for autotuning via MicroTVM.  To test this infrastructure on a physical board, I have added support for ARM STM32F746XX boards, featuring Cortex-M7 CPUs.  As a followup to this PR, I will write a tutorial for tuning conv2d.\r\n\r\nHere are the most notable changes:\r\n- All components in the µTVM infra are now parameterized by the word size of the target device.\r\n- Device configuration has been expanded to include the memory layout, word size, and thumb mode indicator of the device.\r\n- There is now a `micro.device` Python namespace featuring a global registry of all supported devices.  The registry is indexed by device ID (e.g., `host`, `riscv_spike`, or `arm.stm32f746xx`). and maps to dictionaries containing two functions: `create_micro_lib` (for creating libraries specific to that device) and `default_config` (for generating default device-specific config).\r\n- The µTVM runtime API has been expanded to include timing functions, where each implementation is device-specific.`\r\n- There is new a `src/runtime/micro/device` folder which mirrors the structure of the `micro.device` folder and includes device initialization and timer implementations for each device.\r\n- RPC sessions will now use the `MicroTimeEvaluator` when possible, to make use of cycle-accurate timings available on microcontrollers, instead of using wall clock time (which would include communication overhead).\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @tqchen for discussing the design with me!\r\n\r\nCC @u99127 @ajtulloch @jwfromm

are instances where threads can be used before defined. This can happen, for example, when a consumer stage has a thread dimension bound to an axis and that dimension is propagated to producer stages as a Domain of `(ThreadIdx.[x,y,z], 1)`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a pass during schedule_ops which looks for uses of either threadIdx.[x,y,z] or blockIdx.[x,y,z] before the corresponding attr statement. If use before define is detected on these variables it will check if they are defined later in the function being lowered and will copy the attr statement to the beginning of the producer scope where the use before define was found.\r\n\r\nFor example given an IR as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// attr [compute(C, 0x55addf266ad0)] realize_scope = \"\"\r\nrealize C([0, 1024], [0, 1024]) {\r\n  produce C {\r\n    // attr [iter_var(blockIdx.x, , blockIdx.x)] thread_extent = 1024\r\n    // attr [compute(B, 0x55addf146840)] realize_scope = \"local\"\r\n    realize B([blockIdx.x, 1], [threadIdx.x, 1]) {\r\n      produce B {\r\n        B(blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x) =(A(blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x)*1.001f)\r\n      }\r\n      // attr [iter_var(threadIdx.x, , threadIdx.x)] thread_extent = 1024\r\n      C(blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x) =(B(blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x)*2f)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduce B will be modified to:\r\n```\r\n      produce B {\r\n        // attr [iter_var(threadIdx.x, , threadIdx.x)] thread_extent = 1024\r\n        B(blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x) =(A(blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x)*1.001f)\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs when we attempt to compile the first we end up with errors, either in the make_api pass or later.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n\r\n```.py\r\nimport tvm\r\n\r\nbx = tvm.thread_axis(\"blockIdx.x\")\r\ntx = tvm.thread_axis(\"threadIdx.x\")\r\n\r\nn = 1024\r\nm = 1024\r\n\r\nA

topics [1, 2, 3] in the discuss mention that the conv2d failed to pass the shape checking in the runtime after the conv2d has been tuned by AutoTVM. This PR investigated the reason and resolved the issue. (thanks the help from @kevinthesun, @Laurawly  and @vinx13 with the investigation).\r\n\r\n**Investigation**\r\nAll errors happen at the same dimension: the output image height (arg2.shape[2]).\r\nFor example in [1], the workload has input (1, 80, 73, 73) with stride=1 and padding=0, so the output shape should be (1, 192, 71, 71). However, it encountered the following error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTVMError: Check failed: ret == 0 (-1 vs. 0) : Assert fail: (73 == int32(arg2.shape[2])), Argument arg2.shape[2] has an unsatisfied constraint\r\n```\r\nIt means that somehow the output shape is set to 73 instead of 71 during scheduling. After digging into the code, we found that Winograd schedule overrides the strides and padding to be 1 regardless the input workload.\r\n\r\n**Modification**\r\nAccordingly, this PR modified two parts. First, we get the stride and padding directly from the input workload and check if it is valid like previous. This change passed the isolated [example](https://gist.github.com/idy002/6f846c02a05d9b1d8e01ab77638e7226) that yyding provided in the TVM discuss.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Winograd unittest uses fallback config, but the Winograd schedule will fallback to the direct template if the config is fallback. It means the alter layer for Winograd schedule is never tested. This PR also forced the fallback to be False to enable the testing, which was suggested by @vinx13.\r\n\r\n[1]

is a WIP that enables different backends and/or hardware vendors to bring their own codegen tools to TVM. This is the collaboration between @comaniac and me. @jroesch also provided lots of suggestions in the initial design. The RFC can be found here:  https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/bring-your-own-codegen-to-tvm/4501/27\r\n\r\nSome high-level design and APIs involve the following parts:\r\n\r\n- Graph coloring/annotation\r\nProviding HW vendors an infra to customize where they want to execute an op.\r\nTwo possible ways are allowed to annotate a graph:\r\n  - Custom pass: users can write a Relay pass to decide how they want to partition graph using (`subgraph_begin` and `subgraph_end` annotations). For example, more sophisticated algorithm could be implemented to annotate the groups of operators.\r\n  - A high-level API is used to help user/vendors to enable a convenient integration\r\n       ```python\r\n       @reg.register_extern_op(\"nn.conv2d\")\r\n       def conv2d(attrs, args, comp):\r\n\t       return get_extern_op(comp, \"conv2d\")(attrs, args)\r\n    ```\r\n    Each codegen only needs provide the supported operators and they can invoke a separate build pipeline, e.g. `build_extern`, to invoke partitioning. On the completion of this pipeline, the operators that will be offloaded is wrapped with `subgraph_start` and `subgraph_end` annotation. The annotated program will then be sent to the normal `build` pipeline for code and artifacts generation.\r\n    ```python\r\n    @reg.register_extern_op(\"nn.conv2d\")\r\n    def conv2d(attrs, args, comp):\r\n\t    return get_extern_op(comp, \"conv2d\")(attrs, args)\r\n    ```\r\n      \r\n- Graph partitioning\r\nIt is a Relay pass that partitions a program into segments that could be executed on various hardware platforms based on the annotations. The current implementation has not fused consecutive subgraphs belonging to the same backend together yet. It will be handled by follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n- Code generation\r\nGenerate code for each segment of a partition Relay program. Each codegen tool is wrapped into a runtime module so that we can leverage the current TVM infra to do serialization and runtime invocation.\r\n\r\nFYI, we currently used GCC as an external codegen tool for easy prototyping and verification. It should be removed later when we land it.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @yzhliu @wweic @broune @soiferj @junrushao1994 @icemelon9

and resulting nested loop is broken.\r\nThis is due to the fact that we are creating zero extent loops which\r\nare fixed afterwards. However unroll pass breaks due to the zero extent\r\nloop.\r\n\r\nSpecifically this is what happens:\r\nRecent changes in PR, https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3734/ , broke some of the loop partitioning logic. Particularly take for example:\r\n```\r\n  def test_multilevel_splitting_with_indivisble_factors():\r\n      import topi\r\n      A = tvm.placeholder((130,), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n      B = topi.nn.relu(A)\r\n      s = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\n      (y,) = s[B].op.axis\r\n      (yo, yi) = s[B].split(y, factor=8)\r\n      (yoo, yoi) = s[B].split(yo, factor=16)\r\n      s[B].reorder(yoo, yoi, yi)\r\n      #s[B].reorder(yo, yi)\r\n      s[B].unroll(yi)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n      with tvm.build_config(partition_const_loop=True):\r\n          lowered_body = tvm.lower(s, [A, B]).body\r\n          print(\"-----------lowerd body----------\")\r\n          print(lowered_body)\r\n          print(\"-----------lowerd body----------\")\r\n          def visit_stmt(op):\r\n              return(isinstance(op, tvm.expr.Max))\r\n          num_max = collect_visit(lowered_body, visit_stmt)\r\n          assert num_max.count(True) == 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails mainly due to removal of the conditions such as:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3734/files#diff-4d2032b94673aac6728b304262c5b4a6L516\r\nThe issue is that, now we can potentially create zero extent post and pre loop bodies. If we have nested loops as a result of loop partitioning then, the zero extent loops can have nested loop which are further partitioned. In this particular example the nested loop is generated with outer loop's extent of 0.\r\nThis results in inner loop: `unrolled (i0.inner, 0, min(((0 - (i0.outer.inner*8)) - 6), 8))`. With this unroll pass breaks with the following error:\r\n`TVMError: Check failed: value >= 0 (-1 vs. 0) : Cannot unroll non-constant loop`\r\n\r\nHowever if we factor the loop only once things work fine. So the following example works.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def test_multilevel_splitting_with_indivisble_factors():\r\n      import topi\r\n      A = tvm.placeholder((130,), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n      B = topi.nn.relu(A)\r\n      s = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\n      (y,) = s[B].op.axis\r\n      (yo, yi) = s[B].split(y, factor=8)\r\n      #(yoo, yoi) = s[B].split(yo, factor=16)\r\n      #s[B].reorder(yoo, yoi, yi)\r\n      s[B].reorder(yo, yi)\r\n      s[B].unroll(yi)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n      with tvm.build_config(partition_const_loop=True):\r\n          lowered_body = tvm.lower(s, [A, B]).body\r\n          print(\"-----------lowerd body----------\")\r\n          print(lowered_body)\r\n          print(\"-----------lowerd body----------\")\r\n          def visit_stmt(op):\r\n              return(isinstance(op, tvm.expr.Max))\r\n          num_max = collect_visit(lowered_body, visit_stmt)\r\n          assert num_max.count(True) == 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest we revert changes such that we no longer generate post and pre loops of zero extent. \r\nThis PR does

changes are needed to parse a BERT TF model into relay.\r\n\r\n1. GatherV2\r\nTensorFlow recently [added `batch_dims` as an attribute of the GatherV2 op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4d56e9709f1864699be7241a3d1938816d9f31c5#diff-0a1b05e2252bef657373e11f17bfa5d3) to support batched gather. This would cause the parser the fail since it didn't expect that attribute. I added a check to make sure the attribute doesn't change the behavior of the op if it happens to exist and also added it to the ignore list. We can support parsing of batched gather at a later date.\r\n\r\n2. StopGradient\r\nThis is a training op meant to stop gradient flow over certain edges in the graph. It has no purpose in inference so it can be safely mapped to identity.","created_at":"2019-10-31T17:01:55Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T18:37:42Z","closed_at":"2019-11-04T18:37:42Z","merged_at":"2019-11-04T18:37:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f472f94b3d8140dbb4f77f75c9781cb3e850a7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:
