is one of the bottlenecks for groupBy v2 because it sorts the underlying groupers sequentially to make a merged iterator when ```sorted``` is true. With this patch, historicals can sort the groupers in parallel. The performance gain is about 10% without serde and spilling.

a filter field to the JDBC lookups that is used to generate a where clause so that only rows matching the filter value will be brought into Druid. Example being filter=\"LOOKUP_CATEGORY=1\"\r\n\r\nThis is needed as more often than not lookup tables also use a category to identify the lookup type rather than separate tables for each lookup. e.g a table containing, lookup_category, lookup_id, lookup_value. \r\n\r\nThe filter field is optional but if supplied is used to build a where clause. I intentionally left it as a single string rather than filterColumn and filterValue so it can also be used to do more complicated ingestion such as including only a subset of the table with a filter such as \"LOOKUP_CATEGORY = 1 or LOOKUP_CATEGORY = 2 and LOOKUP_VALUE IS NOT NULL\".\r\n\r\nNote there are potential SQL injection attacks in the existing code here but that is beyond the scope of

PR introduces formal core \"internal-discovery\" in Druid. It should be used by any Druid node to discover any other node inside druid cluster. a curator/zookeeper based default implementation is included in druid core but it is extensible to provide extension that might not use zookeeper. \r\n\r\n- For all core classes/interfaces , see `server/src/main/java/io/druid/discovery/*.java`\r\n- For curator based impls, see `server/src/main/java/io/druid/curator/discovery/CuratorDruidNode*.java`\r\n\r\n- All CliXXX.java classes are updated to announce themselves in \"internal-discovery\".\r\n- RealtimeIndexTask and KafkaIndexTask are updated to announce themselves in \"internal-discovery\".\r\n- HttpServerInventoryView is updated to discover data nodes using \"internal-discovery\"\r\n- `/druid/coordinator/v1/cluster` and `/druid/coordinator/v1/cluster/<nodeType>` endpoints are introduced at coordinator to get a dump of nodes in \"internal-discovery\", this is intended mostly to be used for manual testing/debugging for now.\r\n\r\n~~TODO:~~\r\n- ~~add/update unit tests~~\r\n- ~~fix style checks if needed~~\r\n\r\nFollow-up PRs:\r\n- ~~Update coordinator to discover lookup nodes using \"Internal-discovery\"~~ ( #4697 )\r\n- ~~Update router to discover broker nodes using \"internal-discovery\"~~ ( #4697 )\r\n- ~~Add interfaces and curator impls for leader elections and use same in DruidCoordinator/TaskMaster.~~ ( #4699 )\r\n- ~~In a later release, use \"internal-discovery\" to discover coordinator/overlord leader at clients in peon etc.~~\r\n- In a later release, remove the dead code used for existing internal announcements and

methods getFloat(), getDouble() and getLong() to ColumnValueSelector. Then, `LongColumnSelector` has default implementations for `getFloat()` and `getDouble()` which convert the result of `getLong()`. Correspondingly in `FloatColumnSelector` and `DoubleColumnSelector`, with different methods left abstract. `ObjectColumnSelector` has default implementations for all three methods, which cast to `Number`, and `DimensionSelector` simply throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first step for #4622. It is needed, because currently rollup aggregations could process any numbers in metrics, because they use constructions like `((Number) metric).floatValue()`, when metric value is either `Long`, `Float` or `Double`. With the new ColumnValueSelector-based approach (see #4622), ColumnValueSelector should have similar polymorphism

PR adds forbidden-apis plugin, which checks for usage of APIs which use the system locale and time zone. Also, a rule set added to prohibit using Joda-Time's APIs which use the system time zone.\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n - Fixes a few remaining cases of usage of the system locale, after #4409.\r\n - Fixes usages of the system time zone in prod and test code.\r\n\r\nThose 4K changed lines are largely in tests and reviewers could skip them.\r\n\r\nIn prod code, in many cases, this PR changes `new DateTime(timestamp)` to `DateTimes.utc(timestamp)`, but the created `DateTime` is effectively used to store/manipulate the underlying timestamp, without printing and parsing, so such changes don't have any practical effect.\r\n\r\nWhile making this PR I identified several patterns of changes that have actual effect, if a Druid node is configured to have the system time zone which is not UTC:\r\n\r\n - Producing version string from the current `DateTime`, e. g. see `CustomVersioningPolicy`\r\n - Inserting current `DateTime` into metadata tables, and cases when current `DateTime` is used for various different purposes, e. g. see `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator`, `SQLMetadataSupervisorManager`, `SQLMetadataRuleManager`, `SQLMetadataStorageUpdaterJobHandler`, `SQLMetadataSegmentPublisher`, `WorkerCuratorCoordinator`\r\n - Parsing user-provider DateTimes/Intervals, see `ClientInfoResource`\r\n - Cases when two DateTimes are created one after another, obviously meaning that they should be identical, but it's not guranteed. E. g. see `SimpleWorkerProvisioningStrategy`, `PendingTaskBasedWorkerProvisioningStrategy`, `TaskRunnerWorkItem`. I'm not sure I identified and fixed all such cases.\r\n - Changes in `druid-sql` module are special, I changed something but even not sure that it's right, @gianm could you please review those changes? Also, druid-sql uses GMT time zone on a few occasions instead of UTC, @gianm does that have a reason?

Here is the ```GroupByBenchmark``` result.\r\n\r\n### master\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                              (defaultStrategy)  (initialBuckets)  (numProcessingThreads)  (numSegments)  (queryGranularity)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt        Score       Error  Units\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex                             v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30   726532.686 Â± 27038.916  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde                    v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30  1117394.953 Â± 35916.806  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSpilling                 v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30   393236.547 Â± 13619.553  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.querySingleIncrementalIndex                          v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30    55140.080 Â±   731.274  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndex                            v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30    54313.061 Â±   436.293  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n### patch\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                              (defaultStrategy)  (initialBuckets)  (numProcessingThreads)  (numSegments)  (queryGranularity)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt       Score        Error  Units\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex                             v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30  623300.353 Â± 147164.604  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSerde                    v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30  967762.337 Â±  27718.969  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndexWithSpilling                 v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30  363258.193 Â±  10845.352  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.querySingleIncrementalIndex                          v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30   29967.202 Â±    221.088  us/op\r\nGroupByBenchmark.querySingleQueryableIndex                            v2                -1                       4              4                 all            100000          simple.A  avgt   30   33526.929 Â±    401.970  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, array-based aggregation is available only when the grouping key is a single column and its cardinality is known. As a result, it can be applied per segment query execution when the grouping key is a single indexed string column.\r\n\r\nHere are major changes.\r\n* ```BufferArrayGrouper``` is newly added for array-based aggregation.\r\n* ```BufferGrouper``` and related classes are renamed to ```*BufferHashGrouper```.\r\n* Refactored ```GroupByQueryEngineV2.GroupByEngineIterator``` and added an optimized aggregation path for when all grouping keys are single-valued dimensions.\r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\r\n---\r\nThis change isâ[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\"

#4536 by adding a method to DataSegmentPusher.\r\n\r\nAlso changes the built-in allowed property prefixes so they are always added. I think that makes more sense, otherwise a user-provided list might break something built-in (like a Pusher's list). Also changes the prefixes from looking like \"druid.xxx.\" to looking like \"druid.xxx\". This is useful for stuff like \"druid.emitter\", where \"druid.emitter\" is a property but so is \"druid.emitter.foo\".\r\n\r\nI think these behavior changes are all fine for a minor release since allowedHadoopPrefix wasn't documented yet.","created_at":"2017-07-18T02:34:14Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:22:30Z","closed_at":"2017-07-18T17:16:12Z","merged_at":"2017-07-18T17:16:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"441ee56ba9f81acccf5c86cf8c4f15bb49882e03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

adds support for MultipleSpecificSegmentSpec to CachingClusteredClient.\r\n\r\nSQL changes:\r\n- Cache metadata on a per-segment level, in addition to per-dataSource, so\r\n  we don't need to re-query all segments whenever a single new one appears.\r\n  This should lower the load placed on the cluster by metadata queries.\r\n- Fix race condition in DruidSchema that can cause us to miss metadata. It was\r\n  possible to notice new segments, then issue a query, and have that query\r\n  not actually hit those segments, and not notice that it didn't hit those segments.\r\n  Then, the metadata from those segments would be ignored.\r\n- Fix assumption in DruidSchema that all segments are immutable. Now, mutable\r\n  segments are periodically re-queried.\r\n- Fix inappropriate re-use of SchemaPlus. Now we create one for each planning\r\n  cycle, rather than sharing one. It caches table objects, which we want to\r\n  avoid, since it can cause stale metadata. We do the caching in DruidSchema\r\n  so we don't need the SchemaPlus caching.\r\n\r\nServer changes:\r\n- Add a TimelineCallback to TimelineServerView, for callers that want to get updates\r\n  when the timeline has been modified.\r\n- Change CachingClusteredClient from a QueryRunner to a QuerySegmentWalker. This\r\n  allows it to accept queries that are segment-descriptor-based rather than\r\n  intervals-based. In particular it will now support MultipleSpecificSegmentSpec.\r\n\r\nShould fix

of #4479. \r\n\r\nThis patch contains only the prioritized locking and is based on #1679. I'll implement fine-grained locking which include acquiring different types of locks depending on the task spec in a follow-up pr.\r\n\r\nHighlight changes are\r\n- ```TaskLock``` has a ```TaskLockType``` and two states of ```upgraded``` and ```revoked```.\r\n- ```TaskLockbox``` is responsible for managing all ```TaskLock```s including upgraded and revoked ones.\r\n- Lock preemption is based on optimistic locking. It means, lock preemption is not notified to the lock owners immediately. Instead, it is notified when the lock owners try to acquire the same lock again or upgrade the lock. If the lock owners are notified the lock is revoked, they should fail.\r\n- Idempotent lock acquisition is guaranteed only unless the lock is not preempted. Once the lock is preempted, subsequent lock acquisitions or lock upgrade result in failed ```LockResult```s.\r\n- Locks are automatically upgraded/downgraded before/after publishing segments in ```SegmentTransactionalInsertAction```.\r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\r\n---\r\nThis change isâ[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\"

clients can overwhelm a broker inadvertently by sending too many requests which get queued in unbounded jetty worker pool queue. Clients typically close the connection after a certain client side timeout but Broker has to handle all those requests giving appearance of being unresponsive while client would continue to retry and be stuck in this endless loop.\r\n\r\nThis patch provides configurations to have two type of limits.\r\n\r\n(1) ability to limit jetty queue size: to be used when user wants to have limited number of requests waiting when all threads are busy handling other requests.\r\n(2) ability to disable queuing: to be used when user want no request to wait but rather be rejected immediately.\r\n\r\nSee doc updates to broker.md and historical.md for configuration

the method name, `primitiveObjectInspector.getPrimitiveJavaObject` does not always return a boxed primitive object. For decimal types, it returns `HiveDecimal`, which would lead to ClassCastException. This patch coerces that to `double` which Druid can handle.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the patch is about adding the `coercePrimitiveObject` method. The rest of it is fixing hashCode to match equals, adding toString, and applying the standard code style to this file.\r\n\r\nTested a similar patch on real, live ORC
