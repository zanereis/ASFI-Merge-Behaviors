Create a cluster with three hosts, two of them with GPU cards NVIDIA GRID K1 and GRID K2 and one normal host.\r\n2. Deploy a VM with GRID K2 vGPU.\r\n3. Stop the VM and try starting it on a different host. (Expect it to fail as there is only one host supporting that particular vGPU type)\r\n4. The log shows it as failed operation, VM remains in the stopped state, yet the notification shows \"Start Instance\" as successful and no error message displays.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause:\r\n=========\r\nEarlier, it was failing with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, when the list is empty and accessing the first element.\r\nThe error was only observed in Log, but was not showing in UI as it was not throwing any exception.\r\nHence the API call was in turn successful.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n=======\r\nAdded the empty check before sending device details.\r\nWhich says either the required GPU device is not available or out of capacity.","created_at":"2017-11-25T14:01:05Z","updated_at":"2017-12-11T16:20:37Z","closed_at":"2017-12-11T16:20:37Z","merged_at":"2017-12-11T16:20:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c6fb0e3120e80e0682b5666b13e70d640e58daf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3/labels","id":2457915,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNQ==","number":3,"title":"4.11.0.0","description":"This

first PR(#1176) intended to solve #CLOUDSTACK-9025 was only tackling the problem for CloudStack deployments that use single hypervisor types (restricted to XenServer). Additionally, the lack of information regarding the solution (documentation, test cases and description in PRs and Jira ticket) led the code to be removed in #1124 after a long discussion and analysis in #1056. That piece of code seemed logicless.  It would receive a hostId and then change that hostId for other hostId of the zone without doing any check; it was not even checking the hypervisor and storage in which the host was plugged into.\r\n\r\nThe problem reported in #CLOUDSTACK-9025 is caused by partial snapshots that are taken in XenServer. This means, we do not take a complete snapshot, but a partial one that contains only the modified data. This requires rebuilding the VHD hierarchy when creating a template out of the snapshot. The point is that the first hostId received is not a hostId, but a system VM ID(SSVM). That is why the code in #1176 fixed the problem for some deployment scenarios, but would cause problems for scenarios where we have multiple hypervisors in the same zone. We need to execute the creation of the VHD that represents the template in the hypervisor, so the VHD chain can be built using the parent links.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the method com.cloud.hypervisor.XenServerGuru.getCommandHostDelegation(long, Command). From now on we replace the hostId that is intended to execute the “copy command” that will create the VHD of the template according to some conditions that were already in place. The idea is that starting with XenServer 6.2.0 hotFix ESP1004 we need to execute the command in the hypervisor host and not from the SSVM. Moreover, the method was improved making it readable and understandable; it was also created test cases assuring that from XenServer 6.2.0 hotFix ESP1004 and upward versions we change the hostId that will be used to execute the “copy command”.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we are not selecting a random host from a zone anymore. A new method was introduced in the HostDao called “findHostConnectedToSnapshotStoragePoolToExecuteCommand”, using this method we look for a host that is in the cluster that is using the storage pool where the volume from which the Snaphost is taken of. By doing this, we guarantee that the host that is connected to the primary storage where all of the snapshots parent VHDs are stored is used to create the template.\r\n\r\nThis PR was testes with ACS 4.9.2.0, primary storage using NFS and Xenserver hosts 6.5.0\r\n\r\nThis also solves

fixes the following:\r\n- Unchecked thread growth in RemoteEndHostEndPoint\r\n- Potential NPE while finding EP for a storage/scope\r\n\r\nUnbounded thread growth can be reproduced with following findings:\r\n- Every unreachable template would produce 6 new threads (in a single\r\nScheduledExecutorService instance) spaced by 10 seconds\r\n- Every reachable template url without the template would produce 1 new\r\nthread (and one ScheduledExecutorService instance), it errors out quickly without\r\ncausing more thread growth.\r\n- Every valid url will produce upto 10 threads as the same ep (endpoint\r\ninstance) will be reused to query upload/download (async callback)\r\nprogresses.\r\n\r\nEvery RemoteHostEndPoint instances creates its own\r\nScheduledExecutorService instance which is why in the jstack dump, we\r\nsee several threads that share the prefix RemoteHostEndPoint-{1..10}\r\n(given poolsize is defined as 10, it uses suffixes 1-10).\r\n\r\nThis fixes the discovered thread leakage with following notes:\r\n- Instead of ScheduledExecutorService instance, a cached pool could be\r\nused instead and was implemented, and with `static` scope to be reused\r\namong other future RemoteHostEndPoint instances.\r\n- It was not clear why we would want to wait when we've Answers returned\r\nfrom the remote EP, and therefore a scheduled/delayed Runnable was\r\nnot required at all

ScheduledExecutorService\r\nwas therefore not really required, moved to ExecutorService instead.\r\n- Another benefit of using a cached pool is that it will shutdown\r\nthreads if they are not used in 60 seconds, and they get re-used for\r\nfuture runnable submissions.\r\n- Caveat: the executor service is still unbounded, however, the use-case\r\nthat this method is used for short jobs to check upload/download\r\nprogresses fits the case here.\r\n- Refactored CmdRunner to not use/reference objects from parent class.\r\n\r\nScreenshots showing deterministic thread growth for template with an invalid/unreachable URL:\r\n![screenshot from 2017-11-08 13-40-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/32542409-893496a6-c498-11e7-8afb-1b2e1a46e710.png)\r\n\r\nScreenshot showing threads transitioning from waiting->stopped (and re-use) with this fix:\r\n![screenshot from 2017-11-08 14-49-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/32542430-996e0638-c498-11e7-89d9-432b2d0afa89.png)\r\n\r\nTo verify, the following can be tried:\r\n- Before applying this fix, in a test environment register two template such that (1) one has a reachable IP/domain but the resource does not exist (causing 404) and (2) the second template uses a domain/IP that is not reachable at all\r\n- Thread growths can be checked using: `jstack -l <mgmt server PID> | grep RemoteHostEndPoint`, or using a visual tool such as VisualVM etc.\r\n- With the fix + restart, the mgmt server will reattempt to download those template, and a humungous thread growth won't be seen and after say 2-4 minutes all the threads should shutdown, and  `jstack -l <mgmt server PID> | grep RemoteHostEndPoint` will show no threads.\r\n\r\nPinging for review -

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10132\r\n\r\nFunctional Specification: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Multiple+Management+Servers+Support+on+agents\r\n\r\nThis feature allows the direct agents to support multiple management servers. With this feature, a load balancer may no longer be necessary. The CloudStack administrator is responsible for setting a list of management servers and an algorithm in which to sort them, to the management server, using global configurations. The management server is responsible for applying algorithm to the management server list and propagate it to the agents. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nA new global configuration is added: 'direct.agent.lb.algorithm'. Possible values of this global configuration are: 'static', 'roundrobin' and 'shuffle', corresponding to the algorithm that would be applied to the list of comma separated hosts defined on 'host' global configuration before sending them to the agents.\r\n- 'static': No modification is made to the original 'host' list\r\n- 'roundrobin': Rotate items one by one once the list is read\r\n- 'shuffle': Randomly sort the list\r\n\r\nA central utility is reading values from both global configurations on management server startup and is responsible of propagating list to each agent. In propagated list, the first element acts as the main host. Load balancing takes place by prepending the management server each agent should connect to, to the propagated actual list.\r\n\r\nOnce agents connect to management server, they receive a comma separated string of management servers. This value is compared to their actual 'host' configuration, and in case they differ, 'host' property is updated and persisted on 'agent.properties' file with the newly received string.\r\n\r\nReconnection logic between agent and management server is refactored as well. If agent is not able to establish a connection to its actual management server after some timeout interval, it attempts connection to the next element on its 'host' list.\r\n\r\nAlso, a background task is added to the agents to attempt reconnection to their main management server in pursuit of balancing. The interval of this background task is set on 'hosts.lb.background.interval' property on 'agent.properties' file. It can be optionally disabled, by setting property to 0\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nSupposing an environment in which there are 3 management servers: A, B and C and 3 KVM agents.\r\nSetting 'host' = 'A,B,C', agents will receive lists depending on 'direct.agent.lb' value:\r\n- 'static': Each agent will receive the list: 'A,B,C'\r\n- 'roundrobin': First agent receives: 'A,B,C', second agent receives: 'B,C,A', third agent receives: 'C,B,A'\r\n- 'shuffle': Each agent will receive a list in random order.","created_at":"2017-11-07T03:19:39Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T14:51:10Z","closed_at":"2018-02-27T10:49:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ac5ec8759043f3f4bbe56d3fd0329c9792f6789","assignee":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073134,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:management-server","name":"component:management-server","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":589162089,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODkxNjIwODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:work-in-progress","name":"status:work-in-progress","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/46c8f0765f8d603bc52707e996cd7d0be508b0a6","head":{"label":"shapeblue:mgmt-support-agents","ref":"mgmt-support-agents","sha":"46c8f0765f8d603bc52707e996cd7d0be508b0a6","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/us

Cloudstack doesn't allow to migrate the VM's between the hosts with different versions of Hypervisors from UI, whereas using API it is possible. Hypervisor itself allows migration of VM's between different versions, like VMware allows migration of VM's from 5.1 ESXi to 5.5 ESXi. Similarly XenServer allows migration from 6.2 to 6.5.\r\n\r\n**STEPS TO REPRODUCE**\r\n\r\n- Create Cloudstack setup with more than one hosts of different version.\r\n- Try to migrate a VM from lower version host to higher version host.\r\n- On UI, it will not list the hosts with different version. Whereas using API migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume, VM from lower version of host can be migrated to higher version host.\r\n\r\n**FIX**\r\n\r\nAdded a fix, to list hosts of same and higher version on UI while listing hosts that are available for migration.","created_at":"2017-10-25T10:16:04Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T07:37:21Z","closed_at":"2017-11-03T07:37:21Z","merged_at":"2017-11-03T07:37:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d36b7288aefec446647ab67f8149750df43070b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/724f9c6a0c6d53152f5d0d0b5a8d22043be6a605","head":{"label":null,"ref":"CLOUDSTACK-10120","sha":"724f9c6a0c6d53152f5d0d0b5a8d22043be6a605","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"41fdb88970d1a33d57ff08a3ecc239ec898956dc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

zone-wide primary storage based on a custom plug-in to be added via the GUI in a KVM-only environment (previously this only worked for XenServer and VMware)\r\n\r\nAdded support for root disks on managed storage with KVM\r\n\r\nAdded support for volume snapshots with managed storage on KVM\r\n\r\nEnabled creating a template directly from a volume (i.e. without having to go through a volume snapshot) on KVM with managed storage\r\n\r\nOnly allowed the resizing of a volume for managed storage on KVM if the volume in question is either not attached to a VM or is attached to a VM in the Stopped state\r\n\r\nIncluded support for Reinstall VM on KVM with managed storage\r\n\r\nEnabled offline migration on KVM from non-managed storage to managed storage and vice versa\r\n\r\nIncluded support for online storage migration on KVM with managed storage (NFS and Ceph to managed storage)\r\n\r\nAdded support to download (extract) a managed-storage volume to a QCOW2 file\r\n\r\nWhen uploading a file from outside of CloudStack to CloudStack, set the min and max IOPS, if applicable.\r\n\r\nIncluded support for the KVM auto-convergence feature\r\n\r\nThe compression flag was actually added in version 1.0.3 (1000003) as opposed to version 1.3.0 (1003000) (changed this to reflect the correct version)\r\n\r\nOn KVM when using iSCSI-based managed storage, if the user shuts a VM down from the guest OS (as opposed to doing so from CloudStack), we need to pass to the KVM agent a list of applicable iSCSI volumes that need to be disconnected.\r\n\r\nAdded a new Global Setting: kvm.storage.live.migration.wait\r\n\r\nFor XenServer, added a check to enforce that only volumes from zone-wide managed storage can be storage motioned from a host in one cluster to a host in another cluster (cannot do so at the time being with volumes from cluster-scoped managed storage)\r\n\r\nDon’t allow Storage XenMotion on a VM that has any managed-storage volume with one or more snapshots.\r\n\r\nEnabled for managed storage with VMware: Template caching, create snapshot, delete snapshot, create volume from snapshot, and create template from snapshot\r\n\r\nAdded an SIOC API plug-in to support VMware SIOC\r\n\r\nWhen starting a VM that uses managed storage in a cluster other than the one it last was running in, we need to remove the reference to the iSCSI volume from the

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10109\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis feature allow admins to dedicate a range of public IP addresses to the SSVM and CPVM, such that they can be subject to specific external firewall rules. The option to dedicate a public IP range to the System VMs (SSVM & CPVM) is added to the `createVlanIpRange` API method and the UI.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nGlobal setting 'system.vm.public.ip.reservation.mode.strictness' is added to determine if the use of the system VM reservation is strict (when true) or preferred (false), false by default.\r\nWhen a range has been dedicated to System VMs, CloudStack should apply IPs from that range to\r\nthe public interfaces of the CPVM and the SSVM depending on global setting's value:\r\n- If the global setting is set to false: then CloudStack will use any unused and unreserved public IP\r\naddresses for system VMs only when the pool of reserved IPs has been exhausted\r\n - If the global setting is set to true: then CloudStack will fail to deploy the system VM when the pool\r\nof reserved IPs has been exhausted, citing the lack of available IPs.\r\n\r\n### UI Changes\r\nUnder Infrastructure -> Zone -> Physical Network -> Public -> IP Ranges, button 'Account' label is refactored to 'Set reservation':\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12894073/public01.png \"Screenshot 1\")\r\n\r\nWhen that button is clicked, dialog displayed is also refactored, including a new checkbox 'System VMs' which indicates if range should be dedicated for CPVM and SSVM, and a note indicating its usage:\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12894072/public02.png \"Screenshot 2\")\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on button for any created range, UI dialog displayed indicates whether IP range is dedicated for system vms or not:\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12894071/public03.png \"Screenshot

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10102\r\nFeature Specification: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74680920\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nThis feature allows CloudStack administrators to create layer 2 networks on CloudStack. As these networks are purely layer 2, they don't require IP addresses or Virtual Router, only VLAN is necessary (provided by administrator or assigned by CloudStack). Also, network services should be handled externally, e.g. DNS, DHCP, as they are not provided by L2 networks.\r\nAs a consequence, a new Guest Network type is created within CloudStack: L2\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Network offerings and networks support new guest type: L2.\r\n- L2 Network offering creation allows administrator to select Specify VLAN or let CloudStack assign it dynamically.\r\n- L2 Network creation allows administrator to specify VLAN tag (if network offerings allows it) or simply create network.\r\n- VM deployments on L2 networks:\r\n   - VMs should not IP addresses or any network service\r\n   - No Virtual Router deployed on network\r\n   - If Specify VLAN = true for network offering, network gets implemented using a dynamically assigned VLAN \r\n\r\n### UI changes\r\nA new button is added on Networks tab, available for admins, to allow L2 networks creation\r\n![](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/74680920/Bar.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1506997709539&api=v2

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is possible to change the template used by virtual routers, but other system VMs do not have the same feature. The virtual router template is configured according to the respective global settings parameters: router.template.hyperv, router.template.kvm, router.template.lxc, router.template.xenserver, router.template.ovm, router.template.vmware.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users to configure templates for storage system VMs (SSVMs) and console proxy system VMs with parameters similar with the virtual router template configuration:  ssvm.template.<virtualization-tool> and consoleproxy.template.<virtualization-tool>\r\n\r\nIf a parameter is null then we use the default system VM.\r\n\r\nThis feature was useful in a practical scenario where the console proxy system VM template was customized.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

When a volume is uploaded and the usage server executes next,entry will be added to the usage_storage helper table for all the volumes uploaded since the  Usage server executed last.\r\n4. When the uploaded volume is attached, the 'deleted' column in the usage_storage table is set to the time-stamp when the volume was deleted \r\n5. 2 entries will be added to the cloud_usage table with usage_type=26 and usage_type=6 (Volume usage on primary).

Description:**\r\nIn the listUsage API, the Virtual Size of Snapshot is always displayed as '0'.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause:**\r\nIn case of snapshots, the usage is accounted for depending on the value of the global parameter, 'usage.snapshot.virtualsize.select'. If set to 'true', the usage calculation is done based on the Virtual Size, and if set to false, it is done based on the Physical size. In the Usage API, this value, (i.e. virtual or physical) is displayed as 'Size' field correctly, but the field 'VirtualSize' is always displayed as 0. This is misleading.\r\n\r\n**Expected Output:**\r\nSince this is a Usage API, ideally only that size should be displayed which is used for billing, depending on the value of 'usage.snapshot.virtualsize.select'.\r\nThere is another API - the ListSnapshot API that displays both, the physical as well as Virtual size and can be used to know both the sizes.\r\n\r\n**Fix Implemented:**\r\nSkipped showing the 'VirtualSize' Field for type=snapshot\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-01T11:54:52Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T12:47:18Z","closed_at":"2017-10-12T12:47:18Z","merged_at":"2017-10-12T12:47:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"189b0e4487c0caa0204b1dbb3cb5882ad2e7726e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2257/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2257/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2257/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/d6f6823030634fbf6e42d96428beb526de8628fe","head":{"label":null,"ref":"CLOUDSTACK-10060","sha":"d6f6823030634fbf6e42d96428beb526de8628fe","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a4036f708300077d1408ba9b6b930b79b06247c3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

introduces a new certificate authority framework that allows                  \r\npluggable CA provider implementations to handle certificate operations             \r\naround issuance, revocation and

The framework injects                 \r\nitself to `NioServer` to handle agent connections securely. The                    \r\nframework adds assumptions in `NioClient` that a keystore if available             \r\nwith known name `cloud.jks` will be used for SSL negotiations and                  \r\nhandshake.                                                                         \r\n\r\nFS: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Secure+Agent+Communications                                                  \r\n                                 \r\nThis includes a default 'root' CA provider plugin which creates its own            \r\nself-signed root certificate authority on first run and uses it for                \r\nissuance and provisioning of certificate to CloudStack agents such as              \r\nthe KVM, CPVM and SSVM agents and also for the management server for               \r\npeer clustering.                                                                   \r\n                                                                                   \r\nAdditional changes and notes:                                                      \r\n- Comma separate list of management server IPs can be set to the 'host'            \r\n  global setting. Newly provisioned agents (KVM/CPVM/SSVM etc) will get            \r\n  radomized comma separated list to which they will attempt connection             \r\n  or reconnection in provided order. This removes need of a TCP LB on              \r\n  port 8250 (default) of the management server(s).                                 \r\n- All fresh deployment will enforce two-way SSL authentication where               \r\n  connecting agents will be required to present certificates issued                \r\n  by the 'root' CA plugin.                                                         \r\n- Existing environment on upgrade will continue to use one-way SSL                 \r\n  authentication and connecting agents will not be required to present             \r\n  certificates.                                                                    \r\n- A script `keystore-setup` is responsible for initial keystore setup              \r\n  and CSR generation on the agent/hosts.                                           \r\n- A script `keystore-cert-import` is responsible for import provided               \r\n  certificate payload to the java keystore file.                                   \r\n- Agent security (keystore, certificates etc) are setup initially using            \r\n  SSH, and later provisioning is handled via an existing agent connection          \r\n  using command-answers. The supported clients and agents are limited to           \r\n  CPVM, SSVM, and KVM agents, and clustered management server (peering).           \r\n- Certificate revocation does not revoke an existing agent-mgmt server             \r\n  connection, however rejects a revoked certificate used during SSL                \r\n  handshake.                                                                       \r\n- Older `cloudstackmanagement.keystore` is deprecated and will no longer           \r\n  be used by mgmt server(s) for SSL negotiations and handshake.
