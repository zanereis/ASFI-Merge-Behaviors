ERR_get_error() returns the earliest error code from the thread's error queue and removes the entry.

Thus, SSL_get_error() must be used in the same thread that performed the TLS/SSL I/O operation, and no other OpenSSL function calls should appear in between. The current thread's error queue must be empty before the TLS/SSL I/O operation is attempted, or SSL_get_error() will not work reliably.\r\n\r\n在调用SSL_do_handshake、SSL_read、SSL_write之前最好是先调用ERR_clear_error，这样才能保证这些函数之后调用的SSL_get_error的返回值正确。","created_at":"2022-11-26T13:29:43Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T14:12:19Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T14:12:18Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T14:12:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"0c58ead58419bffc6a1593da38035bad63b2b9ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/2019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/d5ab6ac8d69c6d5e20e7260687d1794aae955c91","head":{"label":"yyweii:wyy-ssl","ref":"wyy-ssl","sha":"d5ab6ac8d69c6d5e20e7260687d1794aae955c91","user":{"login":"yyweii","id":598529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODUyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii","html_url":"https://github.com/yyweii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":532300156,"node_id":"R_kgDOH7pBfA","name":"incubator-brpc","full_name":"yyweii/incubator-brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yyweii","id":598529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODUyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii","html_url":"https://github.com/yyweii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyweii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yyweii/incubator-brpc","description":"brpc

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #1963 \r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n- 支持所有编译参数的编译。比如with-thrift和with-glog\r\n- 新增actions目录和配置文件，抽象公共action，加强复用，减少冗余代码\r\n- 支持clang的unittest，gcc的unittest有失败case，暂不包含gcc的unittest\r\n- ~~针对make编译，额外调用一次protoc来处理mcpack2pb中的proto，因为make的编译不稳定，经常报错`src/mcpack2pb/generator.cpp:30:10: fatal error: idl_options.pb.h: No such file or directory`~~ Makefile修复，避免mcpack编译失败\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: [1995](https://github.com/apache/incubator-brpc/issues/1995)\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: When using IOBuf::append_user_data, if the application specify a buffer with an offset over the base address registered with rdma::RegisterMemoryForRdma, brpc reports a failure for invalid memory region.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged: Add a new function named append_user_data_with_meta in IOBuf. Allow application specifying the lkey as meta to explicitly inform brpc. This removes the necessity to lookup the lkey for the IOBuf Block in rpc processing.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响): \r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): To store the meta/lkey in IOBuf Block, the portal_next field is reused when flags is non-0. It is acceptable because portal_next is only used for tls cache of IOBuf, which does not work for user defined Blocks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: [1995](https://github.com/apache/incubator-brpc/issues/1995)\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: When using IOBuf::append_user_data, if the application specify a buffer with an offset over the base address registered with rdma::RegisterMemoryForRdma, brpc reports a failure for invalid memory region.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged: Use a fixed-length array to manage the user-defined memory regions. To lookup the lkey for a buffer specified in append_user_data, brpc scans the array to find the correct region. To guarantee the performance of lkey lookup, we avoid using mutex for the lookup in this array. \r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响): \r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): To guarantee the performance of lkey (linear) lookup, brpc only support at most 16 user-defined memory regions. The application should maintain the user-defined buffer with a memory pool and register the pool one time. And since the lookup is not guarded with a mutex, the application should try not to register or deregister memory during rpc processing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](../../master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).(请遵循贡献者准则).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-16T15:13:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-20T03:58:10Z","closed_at":"2022-11-20T03:58:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"787f647c786cbf45410de55b1fc29de9c24e7ed8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/1999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/1999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/1999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/40a24ab3b5f440d11bfb09c8afb2bc6300157688","head":{"label":"Tuvie:master","ref":"master","sha":"40a24ab3b5f440d11bfb09c8afb2bc6300157688","user":{"login":"Tuvie","id":5780312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODAzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5780312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie","html_url":"https://github.com/Tuvie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137361811,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzczNjE4MTE=","name":"brpc","full_name":"Tuvie/brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tuvie","id":5780312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODAzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5780312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie","html_url":"https://github.com/Tuvie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuvie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tuvie/brpc","description":"Industrial-grade

In C++ 17, use `inline variable`.\r\n2. Before C++ 17, use unnamed namespace to make the linkage of ```ClassNameHelper<T>::name``` internal.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I suggest using the second way to fix

同时兼容Linux和Mac系统，大量使用了条件编译的宏，这种条件编译的代码占了这个文件的大部分。\r\n\r\n导致这个代码文件可读性比较差，另外后续如果扩充其他操作系统、其他事件驱动的API，则event_dispatcher可维护性也比较差。\r\n参考Redis中事件驱动库Ae的源码组织形式：\r\n```c\r\n#ifdef HAVE_EVPORT\r\n#include \"ae_evport.c\"\r\n#else\r\n    #ifdef HAVE_EPOLL\r\n    #include \"ae_epoll.c\"\r\n    #else\r\n        #ifdef HAVE_KQUEUE\r\n        #include \"ae_kqueue.c\"\r\n        #else\r\n        #include \"ae_select.c\"\r\n        #endif\r\n    #endif\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\n使用include 源文件的方式来隔离不同的操作系统的实现差异，单个文件可读性大大提升，也方便后续扩充其他系统的支持（只需要添加一个新的文件即可）\r\n\r\n新增的两个文件之所以后缀名之所以改成了cxx是因为当前的编译脚本会自动对cpp文件编译成 .o ，但是新增的两个文件是无法单独编译的，它们其实是会被选择性地加入到event_dispatcher.cpp中一起编译。自己不能编译。所以改成了编译脚本当前不会自动独立编译的后缀cxx，并且cxx也是一种常用的C++源文件后缀。
