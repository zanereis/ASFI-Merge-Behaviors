is to allow to apply intrinsics \"q_multiply_shift\" and \"q_multiply_shift_per_axis\" for vector type i32x128. Originally it supports only \"i32x32\" which is natively supported by platform (1024 bit vector).\r\n\r\n**Motivation** \r\nThere are situation than we have to use vector size slightly more than supported by platform. As example consider sequence of element-wise operators: add<i32> -> q_multiply_shift<i32> -> cast<i8>. To achieve performance we have to squash it into one single loop (`sch.compute_at(...)`). First two operators would like to be vectorised with using data type \"int32x32\". last one cast operator want to use i32x128 as src and i8x128 as dst. As result we have to adapt all this operator to accept vector size \"??x128\" to successfully vectorise entire loop.\r\n\r\nThis change allows to achieve significant performance speedup for tuning tasks like `conv -> add -> qnn.requantize -> cast_i8`.

PR fixes the implementation of unaligned vector load. Previously vector construction was printed as (float2)(v0, v1). This will cause problem as C have comma expression, and (v0, v1) will be evaluated as v1. The final result will become float2(v1, v1). The bug affects all codegen that uses the default implementation, such as metal.

}\r\n)\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nif the condition is false, the code above will do nothing, however the right way is to assign zero to the shared memory address, or the value of memory is unpredictable, which will make the result uncorrected. we fixed by native shared memory copy asm:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    int pred_guard = (int){pred_guard};\r\n    __asm__ __volatile__(\r\n        \"{  .reg .pred p;\"\r\n

the case where the begin index of strided slice is out of [-ndim, dim), the strided slice operator will yield some incorrect shape inference. This PR corrected this issue by canonicalizing the begin and end index for strided slice and calculate the symbolic shape. Added some new unit tests for out of range begin locations and changed some symbolic shape tests.\r\n\r\nI have 2 questions that we can follow up in the design:\r\n1. Is it expected that in the case of symbolic shape input tensor we should have symbolic shape inferenced for generated tensors after strided slice? See unit test change for details, when we have different input shape at runtime we may have corresponding symbolic output shape.\r\n2. We do have the similar function / logic in topi strided slice implementation. Should we unify them some how? Is it expected that we use some mechanism to store the shape inference logic for both relax / topi operators?\r\n\r\nWould be great to see other contributors opinions on this.\r\n\r\nCC: @MasterJH5574

when using TVMScript to represent a `PrimFunc` variable definition `var_name = expr` defines `LetStmt` with a variable named `var_name` bound to the expression `expr`.  However, prior to this commit, if `expr` is a `tir::Var`, the TVMScript parser would instead silently omit the `LetStmt`, and rename all instances of that variable to `var_name`.\r\n\r\nThe root cause was in the `VarTable.exist` check, which erroneously returned False in all cases.  This was due to a `value is v` check, which checked if the value was the same as the stack of maybe-shadowing values that share the same name.  Replacing the 'value is v` check with a `value in v` check resolves this issue.\r\n\r\nThis bug dates to the initial implementation of the new TVMScript parser in

folding constants while parsing TVMScript.  This looks like a bug, which was introduced as part of the parsing changes implemented in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14200.\r\n\r\nThe operator overloads in python delegate to the C++ operator overloads, which perform constant folding.  While useful in most circumstances, the script parsing should avoid performing any manipulations while parsing, as this can invalidate unit tests that rely on known TIR inputs.  This wasn't caught by any of the existing unit tests in `test_tvmscript_roundtrip.py`, as the inputs to those unit tests are generated by the parsing, and already have their constants folded.\r\n\r\nThere are a few edge cases that would still be constant-folded while parsing the TVMScript, but these only impact subexpressions that do not contain TVM-specific constructs.  For example, `T.evaluate(1 + 2)` would be parsed as `T.evaluate(3)`, because the `1 + 2` subexpression is evaluated during parsing.","created_at":"2023-03-16T14:41:50Z","updated_at":"2023-04-03T14:12:02Z","closed_at":"2023-04-03T14:12:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0db1f3bf241ea94d63131a99b3ef7f740b0d642","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cyx-6","id":16838183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6","html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/448a6be600a48c7666780c476dda0998defd9366","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_preserve_foldable_constants","ref":"tvmscript_preserve_foldable_constants","sha":"448a6be600a48c7666780c476dda0998defd9366","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Motivation\r\nCurrently, we miss a schedule primitive to change the data type of allocated buffer (e.g. via `cache_read`/`cache_write`), and thus we cannot perform type conversion while loading data from global to shared memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new schedule primitive `set_dtype` that follows the interface of `set_scope` and allows users to customize the allocated buffers' data type.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nBefore running `set_dtype`:\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef before_set_dtype(\r\n    A: T.Buffer((128, 128), \"float32\"), C: T.Buffer((128, 128), \"float32\")\r\n) -> None:\r\n    B = T.alloc_buffer((128, 128), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n            B[vi, vj] = A[vi, vj] * 2.0\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j]\r\n            C[vi, vj] = B[vi, vj] + 1.0\r\n```\r\nthen we perform the `set_dtype` schedule:\r\n```python\r\nsch = tir.Schedule(before_set_dtype)\r\nsch.set_dtype(\"B\", buffer_index=0, dtype=\"float16\")\r\nprint(sch.mod[\"main\"].script())\r\n```\r\nwe get transformed code:\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef after_set_dtype(\r\n    A: T.Buffer((128, 128), \"float32\"), C: T.Buffer((128, 128), \"float32\")\r\n) -> None:\r\n    B = T.alloc_buffer((128, 128), dtype=\"float16\")\r\n\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n            B[vi, vj] = T.cast(A[vi, vj] * 2.0, \"float16\")\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j]\r\n            C[vi, vj] = T.cast(B[vi, vj], \"float32\") + 1.0\r\n```\r\nwhere data type conversions are inserted automatically.\r\n\r\n# Other Usage\r\nUsing the combination of `cache_read` + `set_dtype` can help us load data from the memory hierarchy while converting data to the desired type.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @vinx13 @junrushao

PR change the interface of the check function in FuseOpsByPattern, in order to make it possible to broader types of check during fusion. In particular,\r\n1. The old check function signature is `bool(const Map<DFPattern, Expr>& match_result, const Expr& matched_expr)`, which isn't very useful because:\r\n    - The `Map<DFPattern, Expr> match_result` is hard to consume. To retrieve the wanted expr from this map, one has to either keep track of the DFPattern that matches the expr, or to iterate through the map values and filter by expr type.\r\n    - The `matched_expr` provides little help because one cannot traverse to other expressions from `matched_expr`, without the help from things like `var2val`.\r\n2. The new signature is `bool(const PatternCheckContext&)`. A dedicated type `PatternCheckContext` is created for passing information to the check function. This prevents old check functions from being broken when new input needs to be supplied to the check function. Currently `PatternCheckContext` has \r\n```\r\n  /*!\r\n   * \\brief A map which contains all expressions matched by the sub patterns in\r\n   * FuseOpsPatternNode::annotation_patterns.\r\n   */\r\n  Map<String, Expr> annotated_expr;\r\n\r\n  /*!\r\n   * \\brief A map mapping variable definitions to a set of uses.\r\n   */\r\n  Map<Var, Array<Var>> var_usages;\r\n\r\n  /*!\r\n   * \\brief Map from value to its bound variable.\r\n   */\r\n  Map<Expr, Var> value_to_bound_var;\r\n```\r\n3. This PR also changes the signature of `FuseOpsByPattern`, while keeping it backward compatible.\r\n\r\nAs an example usage of the new FuseOpsByPattern API, this PR includes an improvement to the check function of cutlass conv2d residual block pattern, as a follow up of #14252.\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @masahi

desc**\r\nThis changes allow my to compile and tune models for hexagon directly from my macOS laptop without full switching to linux environment.\r\n\r\n**List of changes**\r\n* Replace local linker call with call from docker container with Hexagon SDK. Yes, that is the only SDK tool used by TVM during compilation.\r\n* Enhanced search of ADB. Not only in PATH, but also in ANDROID_HOME, ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and default sdk installation directory. Mac OS doesn't allow to easily change default PATH env var for UI application launched from dock bar. So adb is not available for IDE by default.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nSome engineers would like to continue work with comfortable macOS environment even if they have to play with hexagon devices. At this moment there is no official Hexagon SDK for macOS system. Alternatives are next: fully switch to remote linux, use local linux virtual machine or try to introduce required hexagon SDK functionality for macOS. The last option is more preferable to

When copying the x\r\nto the NDarray placeholder with type 'float64' whose shape is [100,10], the program doesn't report a warning, because it can pass the size check i.e. 200*10*32==100*10*64, however, every 64 continous bits in inputx is treated a number  and copyed to the new ndarray, the values change. because of different hardcode.

is enhancement of [PR#13327](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13327).\r\n\r\n**Motivation**:\r\nPlaying with MetaScheduler for Hexagon target it was found that `avg_pool2d` has rather poor performance due to lack of vectorized code. `IndexDataTypeNormalizer `pass converts all indices to \"int64\" format and `NarrowDataTypeRewriter` should do the opposite (back to \"int32\"). In case of fail, we have a lot of int64 arithmetic for average pooling that can not be vectorized.\r\n\r\n**What was done:**\r\nAdded support of binary ops (\"div\", \"max\", \"min\", \"+\" etc.) in `NarrowDataTypeRewriter`. In case of different bitwidth of operands in binary opeation it does downcasting instead of upcasting (as it was before).\r\n\r\n**Performance impact:**\r\n`avg_pool2d` from quantized InceptionV3 with the shape [1, 8, 35, 35, 32] (NCHW32c layout) tuned with MetaScheduler on Snapdragon 8gen1:\r\n\r\nshape             | Before fix, ms | After fix, ms |   speedup

PR adds support for cuBLAS offloading in Relax via BYOC. In particular, we are targeting [cuBLASLt](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/#using-the-cublaslt-api) API, which has a limited but useful set of epilogue operations (bias / relu / gelu). \r\n\r\nCompared to the CUTLASS BYOC, the introduction of cuBLAS BYOC is motivated by dynamic shape support - For dynamic shape, we cannot tune CUTLASS kernels, so we either end up choosing a kernel that works for any shape (`align1`) at build time or developing some runtime heuristics. I realized that cuBLAS doesn't differentiate static / dynamic shape and already has tons of heuristics that are likely better than anything we can come up with. So I believe cuBLAS is a better default solution for dynamic shape.    \r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @yelite @mbaret

attempting to run inference with an 8-bit quantized version of [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) ([PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/efficientnet.py)), I found that the quantization process crashed, which you can reproduce with [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Wheest/bd4fd601a15d6813e45c9ed5cdbae64f).\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection, I believe that the issue is related to the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation block\", where we multiply the output of a sigmoid with an earlier output.\r\n\r\nSample IR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  %363 = sigmoid(%362);\r\n  %364 = multiply(%362, %363);\r\n  %365 = nn.adaptive_avg_pool2d(%364, output_size=[1, 1]);\r\n  %366 = nn.conv2d(%365, %features.7.0.block.2.fc1.weight, padding=[0, 0, 0, 0], channels=48, kernel_size=[1, 1]);\r\n  %367 = nn.bias_add(%366, %features.7.0.block.2.fc1.bias);\r\n  %368 = sigmoid(%367);\r\n  %369 = multiply(%367, %368);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this fails when we attempt to quantize, because the mul operation quantization operation [does not cover this case](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/9a99fc89a2970b9fca151a573de7a5e409b5d9ee/python/tvm/relay/quantize/_partition.py#L126) (where `lhs_cond` is False, but `rhs_cond` is True).\r\n\r\nI've updated the relevant files to cover this case, and with this fix the model can successfully compile.\r\n\r\nLooking at the [quantization code](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/quantize/_partition.py), this is not the only place where assumptions about LHS and RHS are being made.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it's only \"general purpose\" ops, like mul and add where we need to be agnostic.\r\nLooking around, I don't see any obvious cases we aren't covering right now, but perhaps there are some tests that could be added.\r\n\r\nPotential reviewers: @zhiics @jwfromm @anijain2305; listed as having quantization

discussed in previous Unity open dev meeting, this PR implements data-dependent operation of reshape.\r\n\r\n## Representative examples\r\nThis PR realizes data-dependent operation of reshape as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Target shape will be computed at runtime and stored in tensor\r\ntarget_shape: R.Tensor(ndim=1) = ...\r\n# With new 'tensor_to_shape`, we can convert tensor values to ShapeExpr\r\nlv: R.Shape(ndim=2) = R.tensor_to_shape(target_shape)\r\n# Reshape is extended to take a Var as long as it is bound with ShapeExpr\r\ngv: R.Tensor(ndim=2, dtype=\"float32\") = R.reshape(data, lv)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, `FoldConstant` is extended to support `tensor_to_shape`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Before `FoldConstant`: c0, c1 are constants\r\nlv0 = R.add(c0, c0)\r\ntarget_shape = R.multiply(lv0, c1)\r\nlv2: R.Shape(ndim=2) = R.tensor_to_shape(target_shape)\r\ngv: R.Tensor(ndim=2, dtype=\"float32\") = R.reshape(data, lv2)\r\n\r\n# After `FoldConstant`\r\ngv: R.Tensor((16, 16), dtype=\"float32\") = R.reshape(data, R.shape([16, 16]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n* Introduce new ~~builtin~~ `tensor_to_shape`\r\n* Current reshape takes the target shape in `ShapeExpr | Array[PrimExpr]`. This PR extends this to take `Var` only when it is bound to `ShapeExpr`. \r\n* Extend `FoldConstant` pass to support `tensor_to_shape`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 03/18/2023 Update \r\nTurned out if we implement `target_to_shape` as a builtin, its lowering happens too late and we cannot lower the following `reshape`-like ops since they need at least symbolic shape to legalize. Therefore, `target_to_shape` should be lowered before we lower reshape. New change extends existing `SimplifyNormInference` pass to serve as a generic pass to decompose composite operators like `tensor_to_shape`, `attention`, `erf`, etc. \r\n\r\n### Follow-up PRs\r\n* Formal introduction of composite ops\r\n* Refactor of ConstantFold pass to handle such composite

Motivation\r\nCurrently, some of the schedule checks are too strict, which makes it hard to schedule some workloads such as FlashAttention whose reduction is two-stage and does not strictly follows our standard.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional argument `disable_checks` which mutes some checks. The argument defaults to `False` and we can enable it whenever we want to disable some `soft` checks (by `soft` we mean if we violate such checks, the schedule is not necessarily invalid, and if we violate `hard` checks the schedule step is invalid).\r\n\r\nIn the future, we should collect the `soft` and `hard` checks for all schedule primitives. This PR serves for FlashAttention and only cares `bind` and some reduction primitives for now.\r\n\r\n@spectrometerHBH @junrushao @Hzfengsy

Motivation\r\nThe `LowerWarpMemory` pass cannot emit `shfl_sync` instructions because of an [internal check](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e3c8f2bc2d9ab3f5ba1c0db0755e455bf59a39b8/src/tir/transforms/lower_warp_memory.cc#L334-L337) introduced in #9727 . Actually if we load value from another lane in the warp, the `local_index` would inevitably carry the warp index, and this case would be disabled by the check.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the issue by disabling the check and add an unit test for warp shuffling.\r\n\r\nThe PR depends on #14279 , I'll rebase to upstream/main after that PR is merged.\r\n\r\n@Lunderberg @masahi @tqchen

current cross-function calls in TVMScript will cause PyLint warnings, since the GlobalVar will be marked as undefined vars, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass TestModule:\r\n

syntax.\r\n        return gv0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior into `TestModule.tir_func` instead of direct `tir_func`\r\n```python\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass TestModule:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def tir_func(\r\n        x: T.Buffer((T.int64(128),), \"float32\"), y: T.Buffer((T.int64(128),), \"float32\")\r\n    ):\r\n        T.evaluate(0)\r\n\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def

R.Tensor((128,), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n        return gv0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: It's a breaking change, the old style is deprecated.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR contains the following minor fixes:\r\n- mark `R.function` as staticmethod as what we do for `T.prim_func`\r\n- make `I`, `R`, `T`, `cls` be the builtin keywords for the printer\r\n- define names for functions, modules to prevent naming conflict\r\n- checking the var names is valid via regex expression\r\n- fix typos\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen

recently tried to disable the `qnn.Legalize` pass on the TVMC command line and learned, that the list of passes is actuallt not complete. It lacks:\r\n* Custom relay passes which not not follow the `relay._transform.` scheme such as `relay.qnn._transform.Legalize`\r\n* Any TIR passes. Is this intentional, i.e. to keep complexity down and not overwhelm users?\r\n\r\nMy patch fixes this by automatically mapping user-provided path names to fully-qualified TVM passes as follows:\r\n```python\r\nreplacements = {\r\n    \"tir.\": \"tir.transform.\",\r\n    \"qnn.\": \"relay.qnn._transform.\",\r\n    \"\": \"relay._transform.\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA small unit test for this use case was added. \r\n\r\n**Example usage:** `tvmc compile ... --disabled-pass tir.UnrollLoop,qnn.Legalize`\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n* To not break the compatibility with the older interface, I still use an empty prefix for the `relay._transform.` passes which is inconsistent with the QNN & TIR ones. Should I allow `relay.ABC` inputs instead and deprecate the unprefixed version instead?\r\n* Having these non-trivial mappings might lead to users struggling how to find the expected names for these passes. Allowing to specify the fully-qualified pass name (i.e. `relay._transform.RemoveUnusedFunctions`) would be help but also blow up the number of allowed passes which would be printed in case of a failed lookup in `pass_list.py`.\r\n* A number of passes is currently not exposed automatically for two reasons:\r\n    ```\r\n    relay.transform.LiftConstants\r\n    relay.transform.RecoverVirtualDeviceMap\r\n    relay.transform.ManifestAlloc\r\n    relay.transform.MemoryPlan\r\n    tir.usmp.transform.ConvertPoolAllocationsToOffsets\r\n    tir.usmp.transform.CreateAllocatesForIO\r\n    tir.usmp.transform.AssignPoolInfo\r\n    ```\r\n  1. Using `relay.transform.` as prefix instead of `relay._transform.`. Can anyone explain why?\r\n  2. Mapping `tir.usmp.transform.` -> `tir.usmp.` is currently not implemented. Should I add it?","created_at":"2023-03-11T20:14:17Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T20:22:11Z","closed_at":"2025-02-06T20:22:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bed1a12fd79cdb16e1d9cfffdd9574e4383b4201","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ed6392b38de8f0f1651ebe936ddc8ada2416e287","head":{"label":"PhilippvK:improve-tvmc-pass-list","ref":"improve-tvmc-pass-list","sha":"ed6392b38de8f0f1651ebe936ddc8ada2416e287","user":{"login":"PhilippvK","id":7712605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTI2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7712605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333396446,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzMzOTY0NDY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"PhilippvK/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PhilippvK","id":7712605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTI2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7712605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK/tvm","description":"Open

aims to make the `--desired-layout` argument more powerful based on the previously merged changes from #14010 (@srkreddy1238) by introducing two new features:\r\n\r\n1. Allow passing multiple arguments to `--desired-layout` instead of only one, to specify one layout per transformed operator specified in `--desired-layout-ops`. (Number of arguments has to bei either 1 or match the number of transformed operators)\r\n2. Optionally, you can now specify a non-default kernel layout as follows: `NHWC:HWIO`\r\n\r\nExample Usage: `tvmc compile … --desired-layout nn.max_pool2d qnn.conv2d --desired-layout-ops NCHW NHWC:HWIO`\r\n\r\nI also added unit tests for the new use-cases.\r\n\r\n### Known Limitations:\r\n* It would make sense to specify individual kernel layouts for regular convolutions and depthwise ones. However since both are usually implemented as generalized `nn.conv2d`, we can not transform them individually. Are there any good workarounds for this?\r\n* The arguments of `--desired-layouts` have previously been checked for validity during cmdline parsing (e.g. only NCHW and NHWC are allowed) which is not possible anymore. Should I add a regular expression for that?","created_at":"2023-03-11T18:40:10Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T11:29:58Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T10:31:00Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T10:30:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4520c4f1550bf76e4e547e75ae3ed65d6f55a7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d59b6ec9afa7aa35a5224dc60ce9904bb260cfee","head":{"label":"PhilippvK:improve-desired-layouts","ref":"improve-desired-layouts","sha":"d59b6ec9afa7aa35a5224dc60ce9904bb260cfee","user":{"login":"PhilippvK","id":7712605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTI2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7712605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333396446,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzMzOTY0NDY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"PhilippvK/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PhilippvK","id":7712605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTI2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7712605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK/tvm","description":"Open

cases.","created_at":"2023-03-09T21:31:00Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T15:49:42Z","closed_at":"2023-03-18T15:49:42Z","merged_at":"2023-03-18T15:49:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"2dc5046afc265bd83cd694c13f951d8c51f82fc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f547bd50760fe56ab6ed2f987f0fe2b62420b40c","head":{"label":"spectrometerHBH:rewrite-reshape","ref":"rewrite-reshape","sha":"f547bd50760fe56ab6ed2f987f0fe2b62420b40c","user":{"login":"spectrometerHBH","id":32121147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32121147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH","html_url":"https://github.com/spectrometerHBH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:unity","ref":"unity","sha":"5513095b5a28481ea4aea4979177b16bdc78dac6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open
