PR adds an analysis that constructs a Relax dependency graph in a module (which global functions reference which other global functions) and detects recursive functions, both simple recursion and mutual recursion. Simple recursion is a self-cycle in the dependency graph and mutual recursion is a directed cycle. The analysis works by using [Johnson's algorithm for detecting elementary circuits](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GA/homeworks/hw1/Johnson%2075.PDF) (directed cycles where each node is visited at most once) in the dependency graph and then coalescing all elementary circuits that have at least one node in common to form groups of mutually recursive functions. This can be useful for future passes that need special handling for recursion or mutual recursion.","created_at":"2023-02-28T23:50:34Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T21:23:50Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T21:23:50Z","merged_at":"2023-03-01T21:23:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"69f0abb9a3727c7d7b1b6d78ebcd4315b9ddecf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

view.](https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm/blob/relax-spec-draft/relax_spec.md)\r\n\r\n(Transferred from https://github.com/tlc-pack/relax/pull/273, see the old PR for older discussions and comments.)\r\n\r\nThis document is a draft language specification for Relax. The purpose of the language specification is to serve as a technical reference describing the language's behavior in sufficient detail as to clarify the intended behavior of the compiler, hence it is by design a very detailed document rather than an accessible tutorial for the language. Its focus is the \"what\" and \"how\" of Relax, but not always the \"why,\" though we can add more sections giving design reasons if that is desired.\r\n\r\nNote that «double caret marks» (guillemets) are used to denote parts of the specification discussing functionality that the present prototype doesn't yet support. This notation is somewhat cumbersome, but I wasn't sure how else to proceed because Github Markdown does not support changing the text color (which was how my initial document indicated these areas). The caret marks may look strange in the text, but they have the benefit of being easy to find by text search.\r\n\r\nOut of scope, for now, in this document is the subject of parsing: We should eventually document how we intend to parse Python into Relax, but the parser itself is being greatly reworked. We can revisit the issue of documenting its behavior once that work has been completed. Additionally, this specification is intended (for now) to focus on the user-visible behavior of Relax rather than specifying lower-level interfaces or the precise mechanisms of Relax's implementation.\r\n\r\n# Aspects Requiring Review or Still to be Determined\r\n\r\nSince this document is a draft, any part of it is up for review and open to revision, but certain parts of the document have proven particularly challenging to describe and could benefit the most from community discussions.\r\n\r\n1. The `StructInfo` system has been a great challenge to specify and there are many questions as to how it should work. One question is whether \"strong shaping\" might lead to too many error messages for something that could be checked dynamically. Additionally, many potential shape mismatches could be eliminated using constant propagation or other transformations: If we check shapes without applying transformations, we would force users to add lots of redundant shape checks. On the other hand, if we require these transformations first, that might make the code harder for users to reason about.\r\n2. The run-time representations of values in the language will be important for determining how `PackedFunc`s can interact with Relax values. However, embedded targets do not support the TVM object system, so describing values in terms of the TVM object system directly may not work for all settings. Additionally, it should be determined how much detail about the representations should be included in the specification.\r\n3. Operators used for core language functions (like `call_tir`) should be described in the specification. I am not certain the descriptions presently in the last section are entirely correct, so more review of them should be appreciated. Additionally, are there operators that should be there but are presently missing?\r\n4. Finally, there is the question of _process_: How will we permit the specification to be revised? Does any change require a fresh RFC? Is there a threshold for changes that can be done as a direct PR? I have not considered this question directly, but the language specification is an important document for the community and changes to the language specification should not be taken lightly.\r\n\r\nThere are also some more minor TODOs throughout the document.\r\n\r\n# The Future of This Document\r\n\r\nEventually, we will want this document to be part of the Relax documentation, in which case it will be placed into a different location in the repo and probably be formatted as an `rst` file. Before that, we will officially RFC the spec into TVM to allow for maximum public discussion as to the design decisions underlying the specification. Hence, I am going to leave this document as a \"WIP PR\" until it is officially RFC'd.","created_at":"2023-02-28T22:20:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T03:00:13Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T03:00:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eecc52614e7224abf8ddedd98f9d673ff4b7e61a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":963830470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjM4MzA0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20WIP","name":"status:

The same issue observed by @AndrewZhaoLuo is still present in the graph runtime counterpart, `tvm.runtime.load_param_dict` and `tvm.runtime.save_param_dict`.

We need a heuristic to check if it is useful. This is not implemented yet and folding is always allowed by evaluating expressions.","created_at":"2023-02-28T15:31:50Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T22:13:04Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T21:12:49Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T21:12:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7200b7573b8ac462cf7a63cecf1715ee4eecbc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/11892ac4cf40c7ff54fdb983a2f7958ee5674eab","head":{"label":"psrivas2:folding","ref":"folding","sha":"11892ac4cf40c7ff54fdb983a2f7958ee5674eab","user":{"login":"psrivas2","id":5951769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTE3Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5951769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2","html_url":"https://github.com/psrivas2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":600295516,"node_id":"R_kgDOI8fIXA","name":"tvm","full_name":"psrivas2/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"psrivas2","id":5951769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTE3Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5951769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2","html_url":"https://github.com/psrivas2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psrivas2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/psrivas2/tvm","description":"Open

PR is another way to fix the issue described in #14118.\r\n\r\nSince we do not have a standard for json file on the format of float numbers (for example, we cannot require a json file producer to print the \"integer\" float numbers with at least one decimal), and the json parser is not responsible for determining if an integer in a json file should be parsed to a float or an int, the most convenient way of fixing the SampleCategorical issue will be allowing both FloatImms and IntImms as input, and converting all IntImms to FloatImms accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue in this way.","created_at":"2023-02-26T21:21:47Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T04:17:45Z","closed_at":"2023-02-27T04:17:44Z","merged_at":"2023-02-27T04:17:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"54a62c1b5381a3ab630b143648c6a52b2e761027","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/260ef562605fbb1fd49397d4967cdda24d09a480","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-02-26-sample-categorical","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-02-26-sample-categorical","sha":"260ef562605fbb1fd49397d4967cdda24d09a480","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

we start to build more structure into the program, there is an increasing need to incorporate globally static object that are referred by the IR itself. So we introduce \"GlobalInfo\" here to represent these objects. Below is an example of a possible representation of a distributed program with global info. Pay attention to \"mesh\", which represents the global infos in the module. It contains a list of two device meshes , and they are accessed using syntax like \"mesh[0]\", which is a sugar for IRModule.global_infos[\"mesh\"][0]\r\n```\r\n    @I.ir_module\r\n    class TestModule:\r\n        I.module_attrs({\"device_num\": 10})\r\n        I.module_global_infos(\r\n            {\r\n                \"mesh\": [\r\n                    R.device_mesh((2, 2), R.range(0,

+ 1.0\r\n\r\n        @R.function\r\n        def foo(\r\n            x: R.DTensor((128, 128), \"float32\", device_mesh=\"mesh[0]\", placement=\"S[0], R\"),\r\n        ) -> R.DTensor((128, 128),

base class GlobalInfo\r\n2. add a global_infos: Map[str, List[GlobalInfo]] field in IRModule\r\n3. support parsing/printing for I.module_attrs and I.module_global_infos.\\\r\n\r\ncc: @tqchen,

if the same metadata object (e.g. a multi-line `tir.StringImm`) is referenced for more than one times in an IRModule, each reference will have different indices of the metadata array. For example, this code\r\n\r\n```\r\nstr_imm = T.StringImm(\"aaa\\nbbb\\n\")\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def foo() -> None:\r\n        A = str_imm\r\n        B =

output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def foo():\r\n        A: T.handle = metadata[\"tir.StringImm\"][0]\r\n        B: T.handle =

PR fixes the issue of loss of data type during Legalization. Previously, if we use a constant scalar in operators like `multiply`, it will automatically be converted to a python data type variable, which may lose its original data type. For example, `float16` may become python `float` and be interpreted as `float32` later.\r\n\r\nThis is now fixed by avoiding scalar value conversion. The conversion could be added back once we have better support for scalar prim value.\r\n\r\nCo-authored by @sunggg and @vinx13.\r\n\r\nCC: @MasterJH5574 @tqchen

MetaSchedule, when dumping a FloatImm as JSON, at this moment we are using\r\n```c++\r\nos << std::setprecision(20) << float_imm->value;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, float values that are \"integers\" (e.g., `1.0`, `2.0`) will be dumped as strings without decimal. For example, `1.0` will be dumped as `1`, and `2.0` will be dumped as `2`.\r\n\r\nThis lead to error when we parse back the JSON string, as the parser will treat `1` as an IntImm insted of FloatImm.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR aims to ensure that FloatImms are printed with at least one decimal when dumping. We achieve this with the help of `std::modf` in C++ math, which extracts the integral part and fractional part from a double/float value. When the fractional part is `0.0`, we use `std::fixed` to enforce one

when `FuseOps` and `FuseOpsByPattern` see a call node whose arguments have duplicated parameters, e.g.\r\n```\r\nwith R.dataflow():\r\n    out = R.add(data, data)\r\n    R.output(out)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthey create a grouped function whose signature has parameters deduplicated:\r\n```\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def main(data: R.Tensor((1, 64, 56, 56), dtype=\"float32\")) -> R.Tensor((1, 64, 56, 56), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            gv: R.Tensor((1, 64, 56, 56), dtype=\"float32\") = fused_relax_add(data)\r\n            R.output(gv)\r\n        return gv\r\n\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def fused_relax_add(data: R.Tensor((1, 64, 56, 56), dtype=\"float32\")) -> R.Tensor((1, 64, 56, 56), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n        R.func_attr({\"Composite\": \"tensorrt.add\", \"Primitive\": 1})\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            gv: R.Tensor((1, 64, 56, 56), dtype=\"float32\") = R.add(data, data)\r\n            R.output(gv)\r\n        return gv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is fine if the grouped function is codegen-ed automatically by TVM, but for BYOC use cases (`FuseOpsByPattern`) this is problematic. If a user creates a pattern \r\n\r\n```\r\nadd_pat = is_op(\"relax.add\")(wildcard(), wildcard())\r\n```\r\n\r\nhe / she expects to create a function with two parameters, that does addition. Indeed, if I replace the RHS with an expression other than `data`, such function is created. The fact that the same expression happens to be used for both LHS and RHS shouldn't matter when creating a grouped function. So the current behavior doesn't match user's intention. Moreover, a backend needs to able to handle multiple cases for code-generating the same `add` function with different signatures (one or two arguments).\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the behavior of `FuseOps` and `FuseOpsByPattern`, so that duplicated parameters in the same call arguments are allowed to appear as distinct parameters in a grouped function. If the same expression is used in different bindings, like below, it is deduplicated (the current behavior is preserved). \r\n```\r\nwith R.dataflow():\r\n    lv = R.call_tir(add, (x, p0), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((1, 16, 64, 64), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n    lv1 = R.call_tir(add, (x, p1), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((1, 16, 64, 64), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n    lv2 = R.call_tir(add, (x, p2), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((1, 16, 64, 64), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n@sunggg @Hzfengsy @vinx13 @yelite

requires the index map to have inverse map that can be calculated by the analyzer in order to check whether padding is added.\r\nHowever, such check doesn't always work for all cases because of limitation of the affine analysis that can only handle a set of supported patterns. In some cases, even if the index map doesn't introduce padding, the schedule primitive throws `TransformationIntroducesPaddingError` because it fails to calculate the inverse index map.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to allow buffer being padded without providing pad_value because the original loop extent is not changed and the padded region is not accessed. This PR changes the behavior of `TransformLayout` to allow non-inversible index map.\r\n\r\ncc @Lunderberg @Hzfengsy

current FoldConstant pass does not support removing unused bindings in the post-folding function. Therefore, for large real-world models, the built executable will be overlarge because of the redundant unused constants.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the redundant unused constant bindings in FoldConstant by using the analysis function \"RemoveAllUnused\".\r\n\r\nNote that \"RemoveAllUnused\" only works at dataflow block level. Therefore FoldConstant will not remove unused bindings outside of dataflow block as

may be useful for some passes to collapse chains of definitions, particularly after other compiler transformations that may reduce or simplify some expressions.\r\n\r\nThis pass will take chains of definitions and replace references to later definitions to the original one. It works by checking `LookupBinding` for each var use-site and replacing the var with its definition if the definition was another var. Additionally, `MatchCast` bindings where the LHS and the RHS are guaranteed to match at compile time are canonicalized into ordinary `VarBinding`s.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\ny = x\r\nz = y\r\nw = z\r\no = w\r\np = o\r\n```\r\nWill be replaced with\r\n```python\r\ny = x\r\nz = x\r\nw = x\r\no = x\r\np = x\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginal PR: https://github.com/tlc-pack/relax/pull/233\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Steven S.

PR supports TIR pattern kind analysis for TIR blocks which write to multiple buffers, which is helpful for normalization operators like layernorm, groupnorm, etc.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the analyzer does not support a blocks which write to multiple buffers. On seeing such a block, the analyzer simply sets the analysis result to \"opaque\". With this PR, on seeing a block which writes multiple buffers, the analyzer will check if all the BufferStores have the same indices. And it will only set the result to \"opaque\" when the BufferStores have different indices.\r\n\r\nBy doing this, the analysis works for common cases where a block may write to multiple buffers, like layernorm or groupnorm.\r\n\r\nBesides the unit test for the analysis itself, this PR also adds a unit test for FuseOps pass, make sure that a \"layernorm + relu\" pattern can be fused together.","created_at":"2023-02-21T23:34:36Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T12:56:49Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T12:56:45Z","merged_at":"2023-02-22T12:56:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e792d29af7c924177b66b6527c338cc058656d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b416349b5177a14c94dfc08fddfd5d0a9394bd0c","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:unity-dev/2023-02-21-multi-write-block-annotate","ref":"unity-dev/2023-02-21-multi-write-block-annotate","sha":"b416349b5177a14c94dfc08fddfd5d0a9394bd0c","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR added a pass `LiftTransformParams`. It allows to compile the end-to-end model without weights provided. The idea is annotate the input parameters that are weights, and identify and lift the transformations to weights, and compile it to a separate function `transform_params` that can be executed in runtime. Users can run `transform_params` with weights to get the weights for the optimized model as a prep step before the deployment. In this way, we perform the same optimizations and defer the weight transformations to the user side, while the overhead of the deferred weight transformation can be ignored as it only need to be run once.\r\n\r\nThis pass is integrated with the default `vm.build`. It is optional and only necessary when the parameters are kept as inputs when importing the model from the frontend.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @jinhongyii @spectrometerHBH @MasterJH5574

change adds a PrimFunc level analysis to propose layout transformations to block and buffers in the PrimFunc based on the layout transformations to PrimFunc outputs. It analyzes buffer access to figure this out. It tries to preserve sequential access to buffers when it does this.\r\n\r\nFor example given the following PrimFunc and write buffer \"relu\" transformation `lambda n, c, h, w: (n, h, w, c // 4, c % 4)`, it will suggest to make the following transformations.\r\n\r\n* Block transformation on \"compute\": `lambda n, c, h, w: (n, h, w, c // 4, c % 4)`\r\n* Buffer transformation on  \"relu\": `lambda n, c, h, w: (n, h, w, c // 4, c % 4)`\r\n* Buffer transformation on \"arg\":  `lambda n, c, h, w: (n, h, w, c // 4, c % 4)`\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\n  def elemwise_relu(\r\n      arg: T.Buffer((32, 64, 224, 224), \"float32\"),\r\n      relu: T.Buffer((32, 64, 224, 224), \"float32\"),\r\n  ):\r\n      for i0, i1, i2, i3 in T.grid(32, 64, 224, 224):\r\n          with T.block(\"compute\"):\r\n              v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0, i1, i2, i3])\r\n              T.reads(arg[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n              T.writes(relu[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n              relu[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = T.max(arg[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3], T.float32(0))\r\n```\r\nThese transformations can then be applied on the PrimFunc to get the PrimFunc with new layout.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef elemwise_relu(\r\n    arg: T.Buffer((32, 224, 224, 16, 4), \"float32\"),\r\n    relu: T.Buffer((32, 224, 224, 16, 4), \"float32\"),\r\n):\r\n    for ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4 in T.grid(32, 224, 224, 16, 4):\r\n        with T.block(\"compute\"):\r\n            v0, v1, v2, v3, v4 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSSS\", [ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4])\r\n            T.reads(arg[v0, v1, v2, v3, v4])\r\n            T.writes(relu[v0, v1, v2, v3, v4])\r\n            relu[v0, v1, v2, v3, v4] = T.max(arg[v0, v1, v2, v3, v4], T.float32(0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: This PR is migrated from https://github.com/tlc-pack/relax/pull/449 to Unity

PR fixes a mistake of #14044. In #14044, in VisitLeaf of graph construction of FuseOps, we first check if the input node is Leaf and then check if it is Tuple. This is not right: as Tuple is not categorized as one leaf node, when the input node is a Tuple, the function will return since the input is not a LeafNode. And the check for Tuple will thereby never holds.\r\n\r\nIt is quite interesting that our existing unit tests fail to filter this mistake out. I add a regression test for this case, which can ensure that the tuple is always visited.","created_at":"2023-02-20T21:31:49Z","updated_at":"2023-02-21T04:37:22Z","closed_at":"2023-02-21T04:37:22Z","merged_at":"2023-02-21T04:37:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"94fbfd254cfcc3b5721acf67cff4677e16ea0774","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a6a4fff73c4eebdbabbd79a15bde498061fd1f13","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:unity-dev/2023-02-19-fuseops-fix","ref":"unity-dev/2023-02-19-fuseops-fix","sha":"a6a4fff73c4eebdbabbd79a15bde498061fd1f13","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

adds a new pass, FuseOpsByPattern, which applies pattern matching to each function in the given module, and groups matched expressions into a new function. The end result is similar to FuseOps, but fusion is driven completely by\r\nthe provided patterns. The implementation also reuses OperatorFusor used by FuseOps to create grouped functions from partitioned groups, further illustrating the similarity between the two passes.\r\n\r\nThe new pass will serve the same role the MergeComposite pass plays in Relay BYOC - grouped functions are annotated with the \"composite\" attribute to denote what operations a given function consists of, and offloaded to external backends. But it can be also useful in non-BYOC settings, for example to support advanced fusion that the op-kind based one doesn't handle (fused MHA, conv2d / gemm + reduction fusion, etc).\r\n\r\nThe original

PR fixes two bugs of FuseOps and FuseTIR:\r\n\r\n* it fixes FuseOps who only rewrites the \"main\" function of the IRModule. After the fix, FuseOps now goes through each non-primitive Relax function. Test cases for both FuseOps and FuseTIR sides are added so ensure that both of the two passes work for cases of multiple Relax functions.\r\n\r\n* it fixes FuseOps and FuseTIR who did not take \"call_dps_packed\" style \"call_tir\" into account. The previous behavior will directly downcast the first argument of \"call_tir\" to GlobalVar, which is not right when the \"call_tir\" is in \"call_dps_packed\" stype and the first argument is a PackedFunc. With this fix, FuseOps and FuseTIR will skip such \"call_tir\"s. Tests for both CallTIR and CallOps are added
