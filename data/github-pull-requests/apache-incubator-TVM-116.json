change improves performance for softmax by simplifying the computation and writing a schedule that supports better parallelization.\r\n\r\n**Compute**: Currently, `exp(input - max)` is computed twice: once in the `_compute_expsum` stage and once in the `_normalize` stage. This change adds an extra stage to compute this tensor once. It is then re-used in the `_compute_expsum` and `_normalize` stages.\r\n\r\n**Schedule**: Currently, the schedule only parallelizes the `_normalize` stage of the computation. This change puts all stages of computation under a common root and parallelizes the outer dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe following results are with a tensor of shape `(1,12,128,128)` and `axis=-1`. This simulates the softmax in BERT base. The CPU is Intel Xeon E5-2650, and the Relay target string is `llvm -mcpu=core-avx2`.\r\n\r\n| TVM_NUM_THREADS  | Latency in ms (master branch) | Latency in ms (new branch) |\r\n| ------------- |

small PR address the issue of orphaned sub-process in the RPC.\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\nDuring autotune process on small remote edges (like rpi, rk3399, etc) the transfered ```tar``` is unpacked and further compiled into shared object. It can happen that sub-process (usually compile process) runs much longer and will get orphaned on timeout ```.terminate()```. See the list below. \r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\nSuch longer running orphans overlaps with current measuring process using CPU cycles and even on worse case can lead to ```out of memory``` on limited 1G-4G low memory devices.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nThe PR assures that in case of timeout all childen instances are terminated with parent too and with help of #3574 the residual files are now cleaned properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ├─g++ -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/tmpy1javnqz/tmp_func_4ad0b36aa69fae99.tar.so /tmp/tmpy1javnqz/tmp_func_4ad0b36aa69fae99/devc.cc...\r\n  │   └─cc1plus -quiet -D_GNU_SOURCE

PR addresses some bugs that occur when setting `LOG_BATCH` to a value greater than 0 (i.e. batch size greater than 1).\r\n\r\n- IR pass bug fix for load2d pattern matching\r\n- fast simulator bug fix in ALU code\r\n- CI tests, and tutorials support batched inference\r\n- AutoTVM autotuning works for batched VTA\r\n\r\nIn addition, TOPHUB schedules were updated: https://github.com/uwsampl/tvm-distro/commit/102b9b44039beed13ce48a8d6aea04403804a2d9\r\n\r\nAnd a bitstream was added to test batched inference in hardware: https://github.com/uwsampl/vta-distro/commit/e28d9d56402d0df87011a3374afa93c2119f177d\r\n\r\nTo reproduce in sim, set `vta_config.json` to:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"TARGET\" : \"sim\",\r\n  \"HW_VER\" : \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"LOG_INP_WIDTH\" : 3,\r\n  \"LOG_WGT_WIDTH\" : 3,\r\n  \"LOG_ACC_WIDTH\" : 5,\r\n  \"LOG_BATCH\" : 2,\r\n  \"LOG_BLOCK\" : 3,\r\n  \"LOG_UOP_BUFF_SIZE\" : 15,\r\n

micro-operations `uop` in VTA are 32-bit wide, which is usually lower to the number of bits used by the memory bus. In order to take full advantage of memory bandwidth, micro-ops are loaded in memory burst and written to `uop` memory. The cost for this approach is aligning/masking the data to be written on SRAMs with the benefit of fully utilizing the bandwidth available.\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\n\r\nI recently found a bug when `uop` load-requests had an odd offset (SRAM) and even number of `uop`. This was causing the integration gemm test `test_benchmark_gemm.py` to fail. With this fix, VTA chisel is now passing the following tests (unit-tests, integration, and tutorial) except for `deploy_resnet_on_vta.py`\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nIncorporate the offset into the calculation of the size of the dma request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-28T04:19:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T03:18:53Z","closed_at":"2019-07-28T07:20:54Z","merged_at":"2019-07-28T07:20:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a542e37de19af139ade9c0a7cffb0951a619719","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3af409b38cd5b332454a1aa05c9e62f6282d0cfc","head":{"label":"vegaluisjose:hotfix-uop","ref":"hotfix-uop","sha":"3af409b38cd5b332454a1aa05c9e62f6282d0cfc","user":{"login":"vegaluisjose","id":2478335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzgzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2478335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose","html_url":"https://github.com/vegaluisjose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"da40645fa9dfdf2255df3e4d63444229975cee63","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

(yolov3-tiny) of having **tuned ```tile_size```**:\r\n\r\n**```original (only direct)```**\r\n[Task 13/20 (1, 384, 26, 26)|(256, 384, 3, 3)] (conv2d) {53.46 GFLOPS /direct}\r\n[Task 14/20 (1, 512, 13, 13)|(1024, 512, 3, 3)] (conv2d) {31.17 GFLOPS /direct}\r\n[Task 15/20 (1, 256, 13, 13)|(512, 256, 3, 3)] (conv2d) {28.77 GFLOPS /direct}\r\n\r\n**```original (no tile_size autotune)```**\r\n[Task 13/20 (1, 384, 26, 26, 'float16')] (conv2d) {93.78 GFLOPS /winograd} ```tile_size=2```\r\n[Task 14/20 (1, 512, 13, 13, 'float16')] (conv2d) {93.31 GFLOPS /winograd} ```tile_size=2```\r\n[Task 15/20 (1, 256, 13, 13, 'float16')] (conv2d) {81.34 GFLOPS /winograd} ```tile_size=2```\r\n\r\n**```proposed (with tile_size autotune)```**\r\n[Task 13/20 (1, 384, 26, 26, 'float16')] (conv2d) {98.48 GFLOPS /winograd} ```tile_size=4```\r\n[Task 14/20 (1, 512, 13, 13, 'float16')] (conv2d) {106.15 GFLOPS /winograd} ```tile_size=4```\r\n[Task 15/20 (1, 256, 13, 13, 'float16')] (conv2d) {84.54 GFLOPS /winograd} ```tile_size=4```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite tedious to expose more benefits (WiP on my side) for tuned ```tile_size```, these 3 was found running >1 week on mali. That's all what I personally found up to this day, i am sure there are more, will try soon 5x5 & 7x7 kernels (Unet, SuperRes), and post on tophub exceptional ones.","created_at":"2019-07-28T00:50:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-27T09:12:54Z","closed_at":"2019-10-27T09:12:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60a863dd023e255b4373e8c166993fcdde6d641c","assignee":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":961828004,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjE4MjgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20update","name":"status:

`inflight` counter tracks the number of `inp` and `wgt` tensors issue to the `MatrixVectorMultiplication` module.\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\nThe current bug is related to the way the counter is being incremented. The counter is incremented on the same state `sExe` where the `GEMM` unit asserts the `done` signal. Since the increment happen on the next cycle then the unit will assert `done` but the values are not written back to memory yet because of the depth of the pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nNow, we increment the `inflight` counter once we read the tensors and decrement it when we write-back.","created_at":"2019-07-27T07:35:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-28T01:26:15Z","closed_at":"2019-07-27T20:39:38Z","merged_at":"2019-07-27T20:39:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"da40645fa9dfdf2255df3e4d63444229975cee63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/97f5a444c2eb800d0061cf9f5d8fc3ebd14f6917","head":{"label":"vegaluisjose:hotfix-gemm","ref":"hotfix-gemm","sha":"97f5a444c2eb800d0061cf9f5d8fc3ebd14f6917","user":{"login":"vegaluisjose","id":2478335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzgzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2478335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose","html_url":"https://github.com/vegaluisjose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fbe42c26117f463e4f72590810fabdda6f8466bf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

This PR makes it explicit and configurable in the CMake rules, which in turn allows us to give better error messages if it isn't installed (rather than secretly not adding `cpptest` as a build target).\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally adds docs at the end of the current installation docs for enabling Google Test.  Perhaps eventually separate doc pages for users and developers will be required, but for now, the difference in dependencies is not great enough to warrant a full split yet.\r\n\r\nCC @tqchen @vinx13

PR aims to make interpreter and VM support dynamic shape.\r\nDynamic shape function is responsible for calculating the output shape of an op at runtime. It can have two different semantics:\r\n- If the output shapes of an op are data dependant (`op.shape_data_dependant=true`), the shape function's inputs should be the same *data tensors* to this op;\r\n- Otherwise, the shape function's inputs should be the *shape tensors* of inputs to this op.\r\n\r\nCurrent progress:\r\n- [x] Interpreter can run relay program with dynamic shape as long as all ops with dynamic shape have shape function defined\r\n- [x] Wrote shape functions for broadcast ops, arange, concatenate, and reshape using hybrid script\r\n- [x] VM supports dynamic shapes w/o and w/ op fusion enabled.\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n- Dynamic shape function doesn't support CUDA. Need to wait until VM supports heterogeneous execution\r\n- TOPI broadcast ops currently treat an `Any` dimension as 1, and therefore gives wrong outputs when `Any` dimension is not 1. For example, `a : Tensor[Any] + b : Tensor[3, 2]` is allowed in both Relay and TOPI. When `a.shape=[1]` at runtime, TOPI will give the correct result. However, if `a.shape=[2]`, the result will be wrong. The solution to this issue needs to use auto broadcast buffer (#3389). I plan to leave this to a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n@jroesch @zhiics @wweic @tqchen @MarisaKirisame @junrushao1994

Motivation\r\n\r\nIt's useful to expose the tvm::reinterpret functionality to Relay/TOPI users, as\r\nthis allows them to build (fused) operators leveraging the bitwise\r\nreinterpretation of tensor elements. An example is approximate transcendental\r\nfunctions, which can be implemented similar to:\r\n\r\n```.py\r\n    def C(x):\r\n        return relay.expr.const(x, \"float32\")\r\n\r\n    def approx_exp(x):\r\n        x = relay.minimum(relay.maximum(x, C(-88.0)), C(88.0))\r\n        x = C(127.0) + x * C(1.44269504)\r\n        xf = relay.floor(x)\r\n        i = relay.cast(xf, \"int32\")\r\n        x = x - xf\r\n        Y = C(0.99992522) + x * (C(0.69583354) + x * (C(0.22606716) + x * C(0.078024523)))\r\n        exponent = relay.left_shift(i, relay.expr.const(23, \"int32\"))\r\n        exponent = relay.reinterpret(exponent, \"float32\")\r\n        return exponent * Y\r\n\r\n    def approx_sigmoid(x):\r\n        # <2.0e-5 absolute error over [-5, 5]\r\n        y = approx_exp(x)\r\n        return y / (y + C(1.0))\r\n\r\n    def approx_tanh(x):\r\n        # <4.0e-5 absolute error over [-5, 5]\r\n        x = x * C(2.0)\r\n        y = approx_exp(x)\r\n        return (y - C(1.0)) / (y + C(1.0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee unit tests for implementations of these approximate
