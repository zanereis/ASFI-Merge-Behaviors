https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/10489.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that autotvm can generate uncompiliable code for gpu. There is a built in pass that filters these out. Unfortunately, it is impossible to guarantee during tuning, especially for small number of trials we will grab a schedule that doesn't get filtered out. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we will accept records which are filtered out by the gpu verification pass as proof the system is working.\r\n\r\nThe reason it was flaky before is because once in a while when tuning, it could not find a valid schedule due to low number of kernel trials.

GPU schedule for `topi.cuda.schedule_sort` includes expressions that use `tir.ceil`, `tir.log2`, and `tir.shift_left` that remain in the TIR representation through the entire lowering flow.  (For example, `@tir.shift_left(2i64, (i_0 + cast(int64, cast(int32, @tir.ceil(@tir.log2(128f64, dtype=float64), dtype=float64)))), dtype=int64)`.)  However, these expressions are not currently simplified by `arith::Analyzer`.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two changes, such that these expressions can be simplified.\r\n\r\n* Simplify `ceil(log2(constant))` into a constant integer.\r\n* Identify bounds on `x << y`, for use in proving conditionals.","created_at":"2022-06-09T16:21:27Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T19:32:21Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T18:31:28Z","merged_at":"2022-06-21T18:31:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd800c9cf0963666735680b5927ee5497e4da2a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8e112bac31119034d1333d7d01db23e4e6d17666","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:simplify_ceil_log2","ref":"simplify_ceil_log2","sha":"8e112bac31119034d1333d7d01db23e4e6d17666","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Which usually looks like next:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%0 = conv(src<int8>, wgh<int8>)       -> <int32>\r\n%1 = %0 + bias                        -> <int32>\r\n%2 = %1 * o_scl                       -> <float>\r\n%3 = act(%2) * act_scl                -> <float> // some activate like clip/relu/gelu and others\r\n%4 = %3 + src2 * sum_scl              -> <float>\r\n%5 = cast<int32>(%4) + dst_zp         -> <int32>\r\n%6 = cast<int8>(%5)                   -> <int8> \r\n```\r\n\r\nEquivalent graph on relay level will looks like:\r\n```\r\nop = qnn.conv2d(data, weight, src_scl, src_zp, wgh_scl, wgh_zp)\r\nop = add(op, bias)\r\nop = qnn.requantize(op, rq_in_scl, rq_in_zp, rq_out_scl, rq_out_zp)\r\nop = act(op, \"clip\")   // also ident, qelu, relu\r\nop = cast(op, \"int8\")\r\nop = qnn.add(op, sum_data, add_lhs_scl, add_lhs_zp, add_rhs_scl, add_rhs_zp, add_out_scl, add_out_zp)\r\nop = clip(op)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reach this mapping I have to introduce one more legalisation pass `legalize_qnn_for_dnnl` which reformulate qnn relay pattern to DNNL compatible form. Subsequent DNNL primitive handling is regular (pattern matching, transform to json, dnnl runtime support of new qnn nodes). \r\n\r\n**Additional things**\r\n1. There is issue with analysis of complex pattern after partitioning. Some engineers use linear search like `GetRootCall(fn->body.as<CallNode>(), 2, {\"conv\", \"add\"})`,  which is not fully correct and inconvenient. In this PR I use `DFPatternMatcher` for this purpose.\r\n2. There is potential issue with constant naming and ordering. Because current mechanic of handling `JSONRuntimeBase` suppose  that you visit original graph as is without dropping of some paths or recalculation of constants. To avoid this issue this PR introduces `DNNLConstantUpdater ` utility which guarantee correctness of constant handling.\r\n3. Positional arguments is not convenient approach is you have a lot of arguments and some of then optional. To simplify handling of optional arguments I use node attributes with index of corresponding input. Like \"bias_idx=2\", \"o_scl\"=5 and so on.\r\n4. Added support of \"quasi in-place\" primitives. Currently that is stub and in-place behaviour is simulated via src->dst copy. After update of \"MemoryPlan\" with inlace support this simulation in runtime will be switched off.

microTVM support for the Arduino Portenta H7, from the Arduino Pro line of boards. I've been asked about this a few times (including at TVMCon) and finally got around to it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not as easy as it should be, because of [a bug in the Arduino Core API](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/pull/163). I have a PR out to fix it, but it might take some time to get merged and included in a release. Until that occurs, I've included a workaround in `base_box_provision.sh`.\n\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/byoc-supporting-cutlass-byoc-with-collage/12796/6 for context, which in turn is part of Collage (https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md). \r\n\r\nCurrently CUTLASS has four entry points:\r\n  - The usual 'partition_for_cutlass' partitioning function, using the standard pattern table and pass machinery (see cutlass/build.py).\r\n  - A 'tune_cutlass_kernels' function which augments CUTLASS partition functions with the results of building and running test kernels (see cutlass/build.py).\r\n  - A 'relay.ext.cutlass' external codegen function which inspects the  turning results and generates a CSourceModule for each partitions (see cutlass/codegen.cc).\r\n  - A 'build_cutlass_kernels_vm' function which runs 'export_library' with all the nvcc compiler options needed to build all the CSourceModules (see cutlass/bild.py).\r\n  \r\nFor Collage we'd like CUTLASS to have only two entry points: 'partition_for_cutlass', and 'relay.ext.cutlass' or equivalent. This makes the CUTLASS external codegen integration composable with other integrations, which in turn helps Collage avoid having to understand any external codegen APIs other than the global pattern table and the custom compilation function/pass.  \r\n\r\nCollage also tends to end up requiring multiple partitions for the same backend since it is more aggressive at mixing-and-matching smaller sub-graphs between backends. Thus we'd also like to make sure all tuning, generated code and compilation overhead is shared between all such CUTLASS partitions. \r\n\r\nSo, in this PR:\r\n- We add all the CUTLASS-specific tuning and compilation options as new Target attributes for the 'external codegen' \"cutlass\" TargetKind (cutlass/target.cc). The user now has one place to provide those settings, and we've already done the legwork to plumb the target instance.\r\n- We replace 'relay.ext.cutlass' with a 'RelayToTIR' custom pass hook 'CompileForCutlass' (see cutlass/codegen.cc). This pass obviously can see all the CUTLASS partitions in the IRModule, so we can now share tuning results between them all and can be sure to generate a single CSourceModule. The pass can also invoke the compiler to yield a StaticModule, which we've also already done the legwork to support. In this way all CUTLASS-specific steps are handled at once.\r\n- For convenience we supply 'finalize_modules' and 'finalize_modules_vm' which invoke nvcc for final linking (using export_library as usual). However, there's now nothing CUTLASS specific in those helpers other than their overriding of the 'compiler' to be nvcc.\r\n- test_cutlass.py is updated to use the new API.\r\n\r\nThough this is a breaking change for existing users of the CUTLASS integration the change is pretty minor, as shown in test_cutlass.py.","created_at":"2022-06-08T20:58:39Z","updated_at":"2022-06-11T14:34:09Z","closed_at":"2022-06-11T02:52:29Z","merged_at":"2022-06-11T02:52:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfc8e95604afc8475970b8371d2a93d76b0bddf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d6efea03c67d66ce9c82b49bc64e9ff3436d9f53","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-collage-cutlass","ref":"mbs-collage-cutlass","sha":"d6efea03c67d66ce9c82b49bc64e9ff3436d9f53","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

PR removes the version from the names of the microTVM reference VMs on Vagrant Cloud.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the reference VMs for microTVM had names like `microtvm-zephyr-2.7` or `microtvm-arduino-0.18.3`. This made some sense for Zephyr, as much of the functionality of Zephyr is tied only to the version number. However, it never made much sense for Arduino (as the `arduino-cli` SDK version does not affect behavior very much - only the board SDK versions do), and it is unlikely this naming scheme would make sense as we add more types of RVMs.\r\n\r\nEven for Zephyr, this naming scheme forces us to have multiple RVMs listed on Vagrant Hub, even though we only update one (microtvm-zephyr-2.7, the least downloaded one). By changing the RVM names to `microtvm-zephyr` and `microtvm-arduino`, the naming scheme will make more sense for non-Zephyr boards, and will make the Zephyr RVM versioning less confusing. \r\n\r\nWith this change, versions for `arduino-cli` and Zephyr will instead be set by the scripts that build the reference VMs (the same way we do board SDK versioning).\n\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

don't have a good way to tell if a file was deleted or not in a docs update, so currently we delete the entire `docs/` folder and replace it from the build. However, this includes old version docs that aren't build in the normal docs build. This excludes them from the deletion so they stick around between updates. We'll have to revisit this list at each release but it should be a simple update.\n\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

PR adds `te.extern_primfunc` which provides the interface around TE ExternOp that allows a TVMScript defined schedulable TIR PrimFunc to be inlined into a TE compute graph. The result is that TIR can be used for compute definitions in Relay OpStrategies and, paired with meta-scheduler support in relay as introduced in #10578, these compute definitions can be scheduled and tuned as demonstrated in the attached tests.  \r\n\r\nPrior to this, compute definitions were limited to those definable in TE only. As a consequence of this patch and ongoing improvements to TVMScript meta-programming (#11097), TOPI can be extended to include compute and scheduling functions targeting schedulable TIR uniformly.","created_at":"2022-06-06T05:55:52Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T15:51:20Z","closed_at":"2022-06-13T15:50:19Z","merged_at":"2022-06-13T15:50:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"1420df7744001ad6f805913cf060b6a333bd55d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ad2b2856d82facdd1aff29082cff1b72f544a248","head":{"label":"csullivan:te/extern_primfunc","ref":"te/extern_primfunc","sha":"ad2b2856d82facdd1aff29082cff1b72f544a248","user":{"login":"csullivan","id":4804563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4804563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/csullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"df4f4c0b4bccd775af25967fdf057392c1a2826e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

of #11578, which enforces structural stability of TIR by\r\navoiding over-simplification in affine analysis. On the other hand, it\r\nis possible that over-simplification could be desirable behavior.\r\nTherefore, following the precedent of `preserve-unit-loops` in\r\n`Compute-At`, this PR introduces `preserve-unit-iters` in block binding\r\nfor cases where users don't need structural stability (which is\r\nadmittedly rare).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not affect any existing functionalities.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# The original TIR\r\nfor i in T.serial(2):\r\n    with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n        k = T.axis.reduce(2, i)\r\n\r\n# Our operation is:\r\nSplit(i, [1, 2], preserve-unit-iters=True/False)\r\n\r\n# preserve-unit-iters = True\r\nfor i_0, i_1 in T.grid(1, 2):\r\n    with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n        k = T.axis.reduce(2, i_0 * 2 + i_1)\r\n\r\n# preserve-unit-iters = False\r\nfor i_0, i_1 in T.grid(1, 2):\r\n    with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n        k = T.axis.reduce(2,

@jinhongyii and I observe a recent regression on TVM mainline: over-simplification in `Schedule.split` leads to information loss that negatively impacts search space generation.\r\n\r\n**Impact.** This affects common operators like `softmax` and even simpler reductions.\r\n\r\n**Example.** Consider splitting a simple reduction loop:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(\r\n    A: T.Buffer[2, \"float32\"],\r\n    B: T.Buffer[2, \"float32\"],\r\n    C: T.Buffer[(), \"float32\"],\r\n) -> None:\r\n    for i in T.serial(2):   # <= split `i` into `i_0` and `i_1`, where `i_0` is a trivial loop\r\n        with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n            k = T.axis.reduce(2, i)\r\n            with T.init():\r\n                C[()] = T.float32(1)\r\n            C[()] = T.min(C[()], A[k] / B[k])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSplitting loop `i`  by factors `[1, 2]`, we get:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(\r\n    A: T.Buffer[2, \"float32\"],\r\n    B: T.Buffer[2, \"float32\"],\r\n    C: T.Buffer[(), \"float32\"],\r\n) -> None:\r\n    for i_0, i_1 in T.grid(1, 2):\r\n        with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n            k = T.axis.reduce(2, i_1)   # <= i_0 is not part of the binding, so the system cannot tell if i_0 is a reduction loop\r\n            with T.init():\r\n                C[()] = T.float32(1)\r\n            C[()] = T.min(C[()], A[k] / B[k])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, loop `i_0` will be considered as a spatial loop, even it’s the outcome of splitting a reduction loop. However, if we change the factors from `[1, 2]` to `[2, 1]`, loop `i_0` becomes a reduction loop. This means the loop iteration property depends on the loop extent.\r\n\r\n**Why is it problematic**? MetaSchedule has an assumption: extremely seldomly, a loop extent would impact the iteration property of the loop itself, i.e. no matter the extent is 1 or 2 or anything, the fact that the loop is a reduction loop should rarely change.\r\n\r\nAs an example, `Auto-Bind` finds the outer `k` spatial loops, which are fused together and bound to thread axis. In the trace, the number (`k`) of the outer loops has to be a constant.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Auto-Bind thinks there are `k=3` outer loops to fuse during search space generation, where the last loop happens to be a reduction loop with extent 1, as shown below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor spatial_loop_0 in range(...):\r\n  for spatial_loop_1 in range(...):\r\n    for reduction_loop in range(1):  # <= Auto-Bind mistakes this loop as spatial, because its extent is 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring evolutionary search, the extent of reduction_loop will change and become larger than 1. In this case, the binding strategy will consistently fail because it considers fusing `k=3` loops - which means the entire search strategy will fail with almost no valid candidates.\r\n\r\nThanks @MasterJH5574 for figuring out the root cause of the issue, and @jinhongyii for valuable pointers to the right fix!","created_at":"2022-06-05T00:46:19Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T18:17:33Z","closed_at":"2022-06-05T18:17:33Z","merged_at":"2022-06-05T18:17:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"c732828d48c872ff358191da2e2087d38278bb81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/644576c68e890c48457beee96be917a8ab0f4362","head":{"label":"junrushao:bugfix/2022-06-04/tir-split-over-simplification","ref":"bugfix/2022-06-04/tir-split-over-simplification","sha":"644576c68e890c48457beee96be917a8ab0f4362","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

PR addresses the issue described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11423/ .\r\nHere is some context : \r\n\r\nThe CSE pass had been designed for potentially allowing comparisons (and commonings) of equivalent terms (like (x+y)+z and x+(y+z)), where **the notion of being equivalent was customizable, and no assumption was made about it**. That means that the implementation of the equivalence test function `EquivalentTerms()` - which was at the moment just calling the syntactical equality test `EqualTerms()` - could be replaced later by a cleverer equality test.\r\n\r\nHowever, having such a generic way of comparing elements meant that in the function `SyntacticToSemanticComputations()`, where we were going from a hashtable of syntactical entities to what I called a vector of \"semantical entites\" (which are just canonical forms/representants of classes of equivalence of terms), **the only way was to compare each pair**.\r\nThat resulted in a quadratic behavior of this function, but there was no way around it as in order to merge equivalent entities into their class of equivalence, we had to compare them.\r\n\r\n**This PR essentially does the following:**\r\n\r\n- When computing the classes of equivalences of terms (therefore transforming a ComputationTable (i.e. a hashtable) into a vector of classes of equivalence) : **instead of comparing each pair of terms, relies on a normalization procedure to obtain a normal form for each of them**.\r\nThat transforms a small part of the algorithm that was quadratic to n.logn. However, it's difficult to see improvements in practice, in particular for average sized programs, as that part was a \"small\" quadratic to a \"big\" n.logn (finding things in a hash-table, copying it to a vector, etc).\r\nIt was probably going from a complexity of ~O(((n²-n)/2) + n.logn) to a complexity of ~O(3n + n.logn), so potential gains would only be expected for very large programs.\r\n\r\n- Completely gives the user the possibility to turn ON/OFF the semantical comparisons of terms. It is turned OFF by default (as it's quite longer to compile with it ON, unsurprisingly), which means that by default, the equivalence coincides with the (syntactical) equality of terms.\r\n    As the pass was written with the possibility to do these additional commonings (like (x+y)+z and x+(y+z)), it was a good time to fully plug that completely, up to the Python user who can now turn that ON if he wants to. But again, it is OFF by default, so no real change on that.\r\n\r\nTo run it ON, simply do:\r\n`with tvm.transform.PassContext(config={'tir.enable_equiv_terms_in_cse_tir':True}):`\r\nbefore calling `build()`\r\n\r\n- When this boolean is set to ON, it uses a simple implementation of the normalization function with equivalences that uses `arith::Analyzer::Simplify` as noted by @yuanfz98 on his PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10544 . Note that this is not a real normalization procedure as it is incomplete (i.e., it is not guarantee to converge to the normal form), but it is correct, and it works well with most properties : associativity of +, distributivity of * on +, etc.\r\n\r\n- Clarifies and enhance the test base for the pass. In particular, it adds the tests that were written in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10544 but which did not make it through.\r\n\r\n- Also add the test ( https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo/TVM-Sandbox/blob/19284ddbd6bb28af61c0c2aa8bb334c5c53731a7/tir/test_inconsistent_tir_lowering.py#L1 ) from @AndrewZhaoLuo demonstrating the (older) non-deterministic lowering and put it into a proper test, as I found it useful for making sure that this does not happen again. It has been copied from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10663 and only slightly adapted (in particular for doing the comparison of hashes automatically instead of printing them and relying on a human to compare them).\r\n\r\nMany thanks!","created_at":"2022-06-04T13:41:56Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T16:32:36Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T16:32:16Z","merged_at":"2022-06-09T16:32:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8678a6a9aa7962b658efb603e27d83ea7737a02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f6053637743703c89505464061953fdf1f0e0737","head":{"label":"FranckQC:FranckQC-CSE-normalization","ref":"FranckQC-CSE-normalization","sha":"f6053637743703c89505464061953fdf1f0e0737","user":{"login":"FranckQC","id":89943638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQzNjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89943638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC","html_url":"https://github.com/FranckQC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":426412629,"node_id":"R_kgDOGWqKVQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"FranckQC/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FranckQC","id":89943638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQzNjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89943638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC","html_url":"https://github.com/FranckQC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FranckQC/tvm","description":"Open

PR mainly about mapping oneDNN OP implementation in X86 Relay Op Strategy. we've observed that nn.dense kernel that could be dispatched to DNNL  by assigning \"-libs=mkldnn\" and there is also conv2d kernel implemented in runtime/contrib/dnnl. \r\n\r\nso we mapping it in X86 Relay Op Strategy and optimized the kernel implementation to let DNNL choose blocked format according to different input shape, as [performance-profiling example](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/page_performance_profiling_cpp.html#doxid-performance-profiling-cpp) discribed in oneDNN doc.\r\n\r\nHere is the details: \r\n- Adjust DNNL Conv2D implementation to let it support NHWC format and automate reorder for input/weights/outputs to abtain best performace.\r\n- Add 'target.libs=mkldnn' branch in Relay X86 OP strategy for both NCHW and NHWC Conv2D kernel.\r\n- Add 2 test funtions for case mentioned above.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to enable more DNNL kernels including different format and datatypes this way.","created_at":"2022-06-04T08:49:13Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T11:59:09Z","closed_at":"2022-06-10T11:59:09Z","merged_at":"2022-06-10T11:59:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"f117244ac4e7b1aa86c8c75061682abd4407359e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4a42fa05b51b42d84dffcd1052062ca32b7a69ca","head":{"label":"Qianshui-Jiang:oneDNN_op_dev","ref":"oneDNN_op_dev","sha":"4a42fa05b51b42d84dffcd1052062ca32b7a69ca","user":{"login":"Qianshui-Jiang","id":77087941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDg3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77087941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Qianshui-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":495295320,"node_id":"R_kgDOHYWbWA","name":"tvm","full_name":"Qianshui-Jiang/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Qianshui-Jiang","id":77087941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDg3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77087941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Qianshui-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Qianshui-Jiang/tvm","description":"Open

should fix #11544 and adds some more logging in case the issue persists. Unfortunately it is difficult to test for real since the case data in that PR is thrown away after Jenkins is done (Jenkins does store test data but it marshals JUnits into its own format), so this PR also uploads those to S3.
