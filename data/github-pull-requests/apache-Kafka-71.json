PR is part of [KIP-708](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-708%3A+Rack+awareness+for+Kafka+Streams) and adds rack aware standby task assignment logic.\r\n\r\nRack aware standby task assignment won't be functional until all parts of this KIP gets merged.\r\n\r\nSplitting PRs into three smaller PRs to make the review process easier to follow. Overall plan is the following:\r\n\r\n⏭️  Rack aware standby task assignment logic https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10851\r\n⏭️  Protocol change, add clientTags to SubscriptionInfoData https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10802\r\n👉  Add required configurations to StreamsConfig (public API change, at this point we should have full functionality)\r\n\r\nThis PR implements last point of the above mentioned plan.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

unfortunately truncates the logs before we even get to running this specific test (due to large kafka & Config logging, see #11823) so I can't say for sure that it's environmental vs an actual issue, but bumping up the timeout will help us rule this out if we continue to see failures. We already had some tests using the 30s timeout while others were bumped all the way up to 60s, I figured we should try out a default timeout of 45s and if we still see failures in specific tests we

much any time we have an integration test failure that's flaky or only exposed when running on Jenkins through the PR builds, it's impossible to debug if it cannot be reproduced locally as the logs attached to the test results have truncated the entire useful part of the logs. This is due to the logs being flooded at the beginning of the test when the Kafka cluster is coming up, eating up all of the allotted characters before we even get to the actual Streams test. Setting ` log4j.logger.kafka` to `ERROR` greatly improves the situation and cuts down on most of the excessive logging in my local runs. To improve things even more and have some hope of getting the part of the logs we actually need, I also set the loggers for all of the Config objects to ERROR, as these print out the value of every single config (of which there are a lot) and are not useful as we can easily figure out what the configs were if necessary by just inspecting the test locally.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will help us debug and then fix some of the flaky tests within Streams that show up on PR

PR addresses the issue described here [KAFKA-12558](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12558). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, The PR also allows to configure the max outstanding syncs in MirrorSourceTask because it is currently [hardcoded](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/mirror/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/mirror/MirrorSourceTask.java#L53).\r\nA lot of offset syncs messages are lost during burst of messages in the source cluster or when the MirrorMaker has a lot to catch up (fist run or being inactive for a while). In such scenario it will take a while to sync the offsets in the destination cluster with partitions without regular activity even with reaching the maximum parallelism - 1 task per partition.\r\n\r\nThe PR tries to mitigate the issue by providing a way to change the maximum allowed concurrent offset syncs so that there are less offset syncs loses.\r\n\r\nHere are my steps to reproduce the offset syncs issue because of the max outstanding syncs limited to 10:\r\n1. Source topic with 12 partitions and 1400 messages with minimal activity. Messages are getting produced on daily basis\r\n2.

calls `UnifiedLog.flush()`. For example, this can happen due to `log.flush.scheduler.interval.ms` [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8cca18d7b99d5905a84ccabb813d6a27bc8f44db/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogManager.scala#L467-L471).\r\n * `KafkaScheduler` thread **T2** -> A `UnifiedLog.flush()` call is triggered asynchronously during segment roll [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8cca18d7b99d5905a84ccabb813d6a27bc8f44db/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/UnifiedLog.scala#L1501).\r\n\r\nSupposing if thread T1 advances the recovery point beyond the flush offset of thread T2, then this could trip the check within `LogSegments.values()` [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8cca18d7b99d5905a84ccabb813d6a27bc8f44db/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogSegments.scala#L136) for thread T2, when it is called from `LocalLog.flush()` [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8cca18d7b99d5905a84ccabb813d6a27bc8f44db/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LocalLog.scala#L171). The exception causes the `KafkaScheduler` thread to die, which is not desirable.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nWe fix this by ensuring that `LocalLog.flush()` is immune to the case where the recoveryPoint advances beyond the flush offset.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nI was able to test this manually by introducing barriers in the code to help simulate the race condition. As such, this is a hard case to write an automated unit test for, so I haven't added a new test case in this PR. So I'm mostly just relying on code review and also ensure there are no regressions in existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-26T09:37:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T18:55:18Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T18:55:18Z","merged_at":"2022-03-01T18:55:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"67e99a42361b8f0febc3e691488c668ebfe257e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/7e022d121a6d1e2f9b3ccf3bfd2f85ad62ebf02a","head":{"label":"kowshik:MINOR_fix_recoveryPoint_flush_thread_safe_access","ref":"MINOR_fix_recoveryPoint_flush_thread_safe_access","sha":"7e022d121a6d1e2f9b3ccf3bfd2f85ad62ebf02a","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

followup to #11787 to optimize the impact of the task backoff by reducing the time to replace a thread. I noticed it would take around the `session.timeout` for the new thread to come up and start processing after a thread-fatal error, and realized we weren't sending a LeaveGroup request when a thread hit an exception and died. \r\n\r\nRemoving the `session.timeout.ms` override in the ErrorHandlingIntegrationTest.shouldBackOffTaskAndEmitDataWithinSameTopology test causes it to revert to the new default value of this config, which is 45s.\r\n\r\nSince the current task backoff is a constant 15s, without this change the integration test would fail when using the 45s session timeout.

the compatibility issue regarding KAFKA-12879 by reverting the changes to the admin client from KAFKA-12339 (#10152), and instead perform the retries within the KafkaBasedLog via a new `TopicAdmin.retryEndOffsets(..)`.  This method will delegate to the existing `TopicAdmin.endOffsets(...)` and will retry on RetriableException until the _retries_ (max retries) is hit, or until a specified timeout.  \r\n\r\nThis change should be backward compatible to the KAFKA-12339.\r\n\r\nNotable changes are:\r\n**Reverted KAFKA-12339**\r\n\r\n**TopicAdmin**\r\nAdded new `retryEndOffsets(...)` method that utilizes the new `RetryUtil` to list end offsets for a set of topic partitions and perform retries upon any RetriableException (including UnknownTopicOrPartitionException, TimeoutException).\r\n\r\n**KafkaBasdLog**\r\nDuring startup calls `TopicAdmin.retryEndOffsets(...)` to read end offsets for the log topic and retries if the topic is not available (or any RetriableException).\r\n\r\n**RetryUtil**\r\nA general utility that takes a Callable function, the total duration to retry (may be 0), and backoff time in ms, and that calls the function at least once, and performs retries using the parameters when the function throws RetriableException (e.g. UnknownTopicOrPartitionException, TimeoutException)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-23T00:09:06Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T18:39:29Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T18:39:29Z","merged_at":"2022-03-09T18:39:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"28393be6d7416f51eb51f7fe2b075570b45ef09f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4584555616f3563358b7e49cd8af1f5b33d38f7f","head":{"label":"philipnee:kafka-12879-connect","ref":"kafka-12879-connect","sha":"4584555616f3563358b7e49cd8af1f5b33d38f7f","user":{"login":"philipnee","id":1930388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzAzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1930388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee","html_url":"https://github.com/philipnee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":447334730,"node_id":"R_kgDOGqnJSg","name":"kafka","full_name":"philipnee/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"philipnee","id":1930388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzAzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1930388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee","html_url":"https://github.com/philipnee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/philipnee/kafka","description":"Mirror

seemed to be a little sloppiness in the integration tests in regard to admin client creation. Not only was there duplicated logic, but it wasn't always clear which listener the admin client was targeting. This made it difficult to tell in the context of authorization tests whether we were indeed testing with the right principal. As an example, we had a method in `TestUtils` which was using the inter-broker listener implicitly. This meant that the test was using the broker principal which had super user privilege. This was intentional, but I think it would be clearer to make the dependence on this listener explicit. This patch attempts to clean this up a bit by consolidating some of the admin creation logic and making the reliance on the listener clearer.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

detailed description of your change*\r\n\r\nThis is based on #12157\r\n\r\nNormally, a broker connects to the active controller to learn its ApiVersions, and in co-resident KRaft mode, a broker gets the ApiVersions directly from binary code if the broker is also the activate controller. \r\nBut we only concerns `ApiKeys.zkBrokerApis()` when we call `NodeApiVersions.create()`, we should use `ApiKeys.controllerApiVersions` when in KRaft mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)*\r\n\r\nWhen I described quorum in Kraft mode I got `org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: The broker does not support DESCRIBE_QUORUM`.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the DESCRIBE_QUORUM request was property handled and got a correct response:\r\n```\r\nTopicData(topicName='__cluster_metadata', partitions=[PartitionData(partitionIndex=0, errorCode=0, leaderId=1, leaderEpoch=30, highWatermark=141, currentVoters=[ReplicaState(replicaId=1, logEndOffset=141)], observers=[])])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I also add an integration test for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-17T09:47:41Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T06:46:50Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T22:19:00Z","merged_at":"2022-07-05T22:19:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"448441a35d2f0c200c0f642f2bb618bd2d43df23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/58af486f86d13b2d114af4edf849136a10edc6d0","head":{"label":"dengziming:KAFKA-13228-kraft-api-version","ref":"KAFKA-13228-kraft-api-version","sha":"58af486f86d13b2d114af4edf849136a10edc6d0","user":{"login":"dengziming","id":26023240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26023240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming","html_url":"https://github.com/dengziming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227519182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjc1MTkxODI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"dengziming/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dengziming","id":26023240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26023240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming","html_url":"https://github.com/dengziming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dengziming/kafka","description":"Mirror

#11649, we fixed one permission inconsistency between kraft and zk authorization for the `CreatePartitions` request. Previously kraft was requiring `CREATE` permission on the `Topic` resource when it should have required `ALTER`. A second inconsistency is that kraft was also allowing `CREATE` on the `Cluster` resource, which is not supported in zk clusters and was not documented in KIP-195: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-195%3A+AdminClient.createPartitions. This patch fixes this inconsistency and adds additional test coverage for both cases.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]
