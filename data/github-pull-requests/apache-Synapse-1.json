Purpose\r\n\r\nThe intention is to allow message store to be more remanent so that the following EIP patterns could be accomplished through synapse\r\n\r\n- Guaranteed delivery EIP (https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/GuaranteedMessaging.html) \r\n- Resequencer EIP (https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/Resequencer.html)    \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nJDBC user store guide : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aWIJzi3gUfTbYLxNrXD7K1z4hVb4oY5WMy5sGxFluAo/edit?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nResquencer user store guide :\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1knFw_Twh8jLNaF8-9ObJQ3wMkjXr0FNqnpBv1m3PwVc/edit?usp=sharing \r\n\r\n### Message Store \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1274\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 05 33 58\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/synapse/assets/3785198/9459e563-f259-4e84-a8ac-a11a504decfe\">\r\n\r\n- When a message arrives the message will be placed into the “SeqStore”\r\n- SequenceIdLookup will extract the sequence id from the given message payload/header based on the specified XPath value \r\n- Based on the id identified the message will be inserted into the table in DB. \r\n\r\n### Message Processor \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1299\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-06 at 05 34 12\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/synapse/assets/3785198/81144eec-1bdf-4378-b09f-c2c4460a00ac\">\r\n\r\n- Processor would poll to get the message \r\n- First the last processed message id would be returned from the DB/cache \r\n- Based on the last processed id the messages would be retrieved from the DB. The top most message would be retrieved and will be validated retrievedMessageId < lastProcessId (this should ensure that the DB has the messages in sorted order)\r\n- If the validation is successful, the message would be popped from the DB and will be sent to the caller. \r\n\r\n### Resequence Message Properties \r\n\r\nResequence message store will inherit all properties applicable for JDBC message store. In addition the following \r\n\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-3547ef44-7fff-eb76-312a-acbb8542ae04\"><div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\" align=\"left\">\r\nProperty Name | Description\r\n-- | --\r\nstore.resequence.timeout | The count will be a positive integer. The timeout will be specified in seconds. This specifies the timeout the message resequencing order should be ensured. I.e if the current message sequence is ‘3’ it’s predecessor would be 2 and the successor would be 4. If ‘4’ is not present there’s a gap in the sequence. During the gap the processor would wait until the specified timeout is exceeded. If the timeout exceeds it’s limit, the next minimum sequence id available in the store will be selected as its predecessor.If the count is specified as ‘-1’ the processor will wait indefinitely until the correct sequence id is present to fill the gap. Please note that the timeout will be a rough estimate. The durations could vary. Depending on the load of the machine.\r\nstore.resequence.id.path | Specifies how the store could identify the sequence id from the message content. The path could be either an XPath or a JSON path. Which could be specified in the expression field.  The sequence id should be a positive integer. The store would expect the sequence id to start from 1.\r\n\r\n</div><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"width:100px;display:inline-block;position:relative;\"></span></span></p></b><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Release note\r\nJDBC message store & Resequencing message store which will support achieving EIP patterns such as guaranteed delivery &  Resequencer\r\n\r\n## Automation tests\r\nIntegration tests included.

Security Vulnerability Fix\n\nThis pull request fixes a Zip Slip vulnerability either due to an insufficient, or missing guard when unzipping zip files.\n\nEven if you deem, as the maintainer of this project, this is not necessarily fixing a security vulnerability, it is still, most likely, a valid security hardening.\n\n## Preamble\n\n### Impact\n\nThis issue allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected destination directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on the file system.\nOverwriting certain files/directories could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a target system by exploiting this vulnerability.\n\n### Why?\n\nThe best description of Zip-Slip can be found in the white paper published by Snyk: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)\n\n#### But I had a guard in place, why wasn't it sufficient?\n\nIf the changes you see are a change to the guard, not the addition of a new guard, this is probably because this code contains a Zip-Slip vulnerability due to a partial path traversal vulnerability.\n\nTo demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\")`.\nThe check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.\nIt's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.\nFor example, on Linux, `println(new File(\"/var\"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\")` will print `/var/`;\nhowever, `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.\n\n### The Fix\n\nImplementing a guard comparing paths with the method `java.nio.files.Path#startsWith` will adequately protect against this vulnerability.\n\nFor example: `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)` or `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY_FILE.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`\n\n### Other Examples\n\n - [CVE-2018-1002201](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGZEROTURNAROUND-31681) - zeroturnaround/zt-zip\n - [CVE-2018-1002202](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-NETLINGALAZIP4J-31679) - srikanth-lingala/zip4j\n - [CVE-2018-8009](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8009) - apache/hadoop\n\n# :arrow_right: Vulnerability Disclosure :arrow_left:\n\n:wave: Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!\n\nFirst question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!\n\n 1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!\n 2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!\n\nFor partial path traversal, consider if user-supplied input could ever flow to this logic. If user-supplied input could reach this conditional, it's  insufficient and, as such, most likely a vulnerability.\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To\n\nYou have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:\n\n 1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.\n 2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the [Snyk's Disclosure Email](mailto:report@snyk.io). Note: Please include `JLLeitschuh Disclosure` in the subject of your email so it is not missed.\n\n## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\n\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).\n\nI'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.\n\n## Source\n\nThis contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly handcrafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\n\nThe source code that generated this PR can be found here:\n[Zip Slip](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/ZipSlip.java)\n\n## Why didn't you disclose privately (ie. coordinated disclosure)?\n\nThis PR was automatically generated, in-bulk, and sent to this project as well as many others, all at the same time.\n\nThis is technically what is called a \"Full Disclosure\" in vulnerability disclosure, and I agree it's less than ideal. If GitHub offered a way to create private pull requests to submit pull requests, I'd leverage it, but that infrastructure, sadly, doesn't exist yet.\n\nThe problem is that, as an open source software security researcher, I (exactly like open source maintainers), I only have so much time in a day. I'm able to find vulnerabilities impacting hundreds, or sometimes thousands of open source projects with tools like GitHub Code Search and CodeQL. The problem is that my knowledge of vulnerabilities doesn't scale very well.\n\nIndividualized vulnerability disclosure takes time and care. It's a long and tedious process, and I have a significant amount of experience with it (I have over 50 CVEs to my name). Even tracking down the reporting channel (email, Jira, etc..) can take time and isn't automatable. Unfortunately, when facing problems of this scale, individual reporting doesn't work well either.\n\nAdditionally, if I just spam out emails or issues, I'll just overwhelm already over-taxed maintainers, I don't want to do this either.\n\nBy creating a pull request, I am aiming to provide maintainers something highly actionable to actually fix the identified vulnerability; a pull request.\n\nThere's a larger discussion on this topic that can be found here:  https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/discussions/12\n\n## Opting Out\n\nIf you'd like to opt out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:\n\n```\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research\nDisallow: *\n```\n\nThis bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.\n\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.\n\n## CLA Requirements\n\n_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._\n\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Sponsorship & Support\n\nThis contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.\n\nThis PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST

behavior of the Message Forwarding Processor is to consume all the messages at once. For instance, say, the Message Forwarding Processor is configured to run every 10 seconds and the Message store is filled with 5 messages within the 10 second gap. In such a situation, Message Forwarding Processor consumes all 5 messages and try to send it to back-end as fast as possible. I think this behavior is not optimal. The purpose of Message Forwarding Processor it to send messages to the back-end in a controlled rate. So that the back-end server can handle the load. IMO, ideal behavior should be to consume one message at a time and try to send it to the back-end as per the configured interval. \r\n\r\nI have implemented this feature by introducing the below configuration to Message Processor.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<parameter name=\"consume.all\">false</parameter>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault behavior is to consume all the messages at once. When the value of `consume.all`, is set to `false`. Message processor would only consume one message per each trigger.\r\n\r\n**Please Note** that I have done a small refactoring along with this change by extracting out some code to `setRetryInterval()`

the moment Message Processor only support one interval for both fetching messages from the store and retrying when there is a failure. But, IMO, these are two different concepts and deserve two different configurations. Therefore, this PR introduces the new retry interval as follows,\r\n\r\n```<parameter name=\"retry.interval\">10000</parameter>```\r\n\r\nThis will allow the user to control the speed of retry when there is a failure. \r\n\r\nPlease note that after the change I have re-tested all the scenarios such as,\r\n\r\n**Out Only Scenario**\r\n\r\n- Success scenario\r\n- Retry scenario\r\n- Max delivery

the moment Message Processor only support one interval for both fetching messages from the store and retrying when there is a failure. But, IMO, these are two different concepts and deserve two different configurations. Therefore, this PR introduces the new retry interval as follows,\r\n\r\n```<parameter name=\"retry.interval\">10000</parameter>```\r\n\r\nThis will allow the user to control the speed of retry when there is a failure. \r\n\r\nPlease note that after the change I have re-tested all the scenarios such as,\r\n\r\n**Out Only Scenario**\r\n\r\n- Success scenario\r\n- Retry scenario\r\n- Max delivery

All,\r\n\r\nThis PR does the $subject and in the process I have fixed two issues as well. \r\n\r\nProgrammers spend more time to reading code and less time on writing code. Therefore, it is needless to say that having readable code is essential in any project. `ForwardingJob` class was actually the opposite of this (forgive me for saying this) and it is very hard to read the code do new modification. Making the code vulnerable for regression issues. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I have refactored the code starting the basic principle of functions doing one and only one thing. In the processes I have moved some variables into class variables as actually control the state of the `ForwadingJob`. Also, code abstraction done in a way that, reader starts with the highest abstraction of the concept and then drill down to more granular abstractions. This is similar to news-paper metaphor. Also, all the functions follow vertical affinity and therefore closely related functions are placed next to other.\r\n\r\nPlease note that after the refactor I have re-tested all the scenarios such as,\r\n\r\n**Out Only Scenario**\r\n- Success scenario \r\n- Retry scenario \r\n- Max delivery scenario \r\n- Max delivery drop scenario \r\n- Invoking Deactivate scenario \r\n\r\n**Response Scenario** \r\n- Success scenario \r\n- Retry scenario \r\n- Retry on application level failure scenario \r\n- Invoking reply sequence scenario \r\n- Invoking fault sequence scenario \r\n- Invoking deactivate sequence scenario \r\n- Max delivery attempt scenario \r\n- Max delivery drop scenario \r\n\r\nAlong with this I have fixed below two

the moment, current MFP implementation does not support retrying based on HTTP status codes. It only supports retrying for transport level failures but not for application level failures. As you know, in HTTP protocol, application level failures are distinguished using different status codes. In the case of MFP, it is important to be able to retry for 5xx server errors. But there also could be rare occasions in which retrying for 4xx and 3xx are useful. Especially when dealing with servers that do not follow HTTP protocol exactly as it is.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have improved MFP implementation to support retrying based on the returned HTTP status code as well. Say, a user wants to retry for HTTP status codes 500 and 504 but not for any other HTTP status code. In that case user can configure the MFP as below. Please note the parameter in bold font which I have introduced along with this feature. \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<messageProcessor xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\"     \r\n class=\"org.apache.synapse.message.processors.forward.ScheduledMessageForwardingProcessor\"\r\n                  name=\"Processor2\"\r\n                  messageStore=\"JMSMS\">\r\n   <parameter name=\"max.delivery.attempts\">4</parameter>\r\n   <parameter name=\"message.processor.reply.sequence\">replySequence</parameter>\r\n   <parameter name=\"interval\">1000</parameter>\r\n   <parameter name=\"retry.http.status.codes\">500, 504</parameter>\r\n</messageProcessor>\r\n```\r\nPlease not that the above parameter does not come to effect in case of out-only. Once this is merged, I am planning to send another PR for the required documentation

All,\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is no direct way to know if the master is broken. For instance, recently, Synapse master was broken due to an expired certificate but nobody knew till someone built it locally. This problem is solved with this PR. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a github workflow which triggers a build on master every midnight. This allows us to immediately get to know if the master is broken. So that we can quickly attend to it and get if fixed.\r\n\r\nAlong with the github workflow, this PR also adds a badge to Readme.md which indicates status of the synapse daily

the below Proxy service in which I have configured the log-mediator to print logs only when the category is set to DEBUG. However, there is no way to start the server with log-mediator debug logs enabled. \r\n\r\nOnly way to print the property values inside the log mediator is by configuring debug mode for the log -mediator class in the log4j.properties. But this is wrong because aforementioned configuration is there for the implementer of log-mediator but not for the synapse user.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n <proxy xmlns=\"http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse\"\r\n
