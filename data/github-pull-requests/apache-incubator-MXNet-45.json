Description ##\r\n\r\n1. <s>Make to_tensor as operator. No contribution to gradient.</s>Add description, InPlaceOption and other parameters during operator registration.\r\n2. Support CPU and GPU. This PR adds GPU supports and re-organizes previously supported CPU.\r\n3. to_tensor transformation operator can take 3D (c, h, w) or 4D (n, c, h, w) at once. So that a batch of input can be passed in the transformation.\r\n4. Parallelization with OMP\r\n5. This is backward compatible change. No existing functionality will be affected.\r\n\r\n# Background \r\nWe can enable users to fuse transformation operators with network graph and export it. This end to end network with transforms + network will greatly simplify inference deployment.\r\nRelated PR for normalize transformation - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13802/\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Make to_tensor to accept 3D or 4D input\r\n- CPU / GPU support\r\n- No gradient contribution\r\n- Reorganize like any other operators\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- A related PR was raised here https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13614 reviewed by @apeforest and @stu1130 - I have addressed those comments.

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nCurrently `NDArray.arange` requires manually passing all parameters.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nPut back default parameters for `NDArray.arange` and update unit test.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nProbably due to #12064 where a lot of changes were made and at the end default parameters got omitted unintentionally, which wasn't caught by

Description ##\r\nThis PR uses OpenCV/Origami as the image manipulation library.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nBasically using library: [origami \"4.0.0-2\"] with imports: \r\n```\r\n[opencv4.core :as cv]\r\n[opencv4.utils :as cvu]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever possible. \r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThis PR updates the main LICENSE file by adding missing subcomponents of the project, combining the BSD licenses to their own section, and removing several subcomponents that were deleted.\r\n\r\nIt updates the two whitelists for automatic license checks by removing files that should not be there (this may involve adding the appropriate headers to files). Explanations were also added for each element in the license_header.py whitelist. Lastly, automatic checking for clojure and pyx files was also enabled.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2019-01-09T02:10:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T19:14:49Z","closed_at":"2019-01-10T01:00:30Z","merged_at":"2019-01-10T01:00:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"55ffe252b44bde71c2ca1048da31162532e6823c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":863189797,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjMxODk3OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Licenses","name":"Licenses","color":"7efcde","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5c9f1763bd740b9a7d49701f1e08b4eca2e3cd3f","head":{"label":"zachgk:license","ref":"license","sha":"5c9f1763bd740b9a7d49701f1e08b4eca2e3cd3f","user":{"login":"zachgk","id":1329299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjkyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1329299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk","html_url":"https://github.com/zachgk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachgk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143360201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMzNjAyMDE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zachgk/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zachgk","id":1329299,"node_id

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-09T01:30:12Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T22:28:54Z","closed_at":"2019-01-31T18:55:13Z","merged_at":"2019-01-31T18:55:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a3e4a02ded9c6d2c304557140dac0c9991d507e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n\r\nIf you have a dirty working copy, license_header.py check will check for license on build files and all kinds of files you have lying around in the working directory, this is very annoying.\r\n\r\nThis modification cleans up the script and detects if we are under git to only use files known in revision control in terms of license. If we are outside git (source distribution) it works as before.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2019-01-08T22:35:23Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T00:11:32Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T00:11:32Z","merged_at":"2019-01-11T00:11:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"5086da158226f634ffc1b5d51bd8c6c29d655e3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n\r\n1. <s>Make normalize as operator. No contribution to gradient.</s> Add backward function to normalize operator.\r\n2. Support CPU and GPU. This PR adds GPU supports and re-organizes previously supported CPU.\r\n3. Normalize transformation operator can take 3D (c, h, w) or 4D (n, c, h, w) at once. So that a batch of input can be passed in the transformation.\r\n4. Parallelization with OMP\r\n5. This is backward compatible change. No existing functionality will be affected.\r\n\r\n# Background \r\nWe can enable users to fuse transformation operators with network graph and export it. This end to end network with transforms + network will greatly simplify inference deployment.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Make Normalize to accept 3D or 4D input\r\n- CPU / GPU support\r\n- No gradient contribution\r\n- Reorganize like any other operators\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- A related PR was raised here https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13614 reviewed by @apeforest and @stu1130 - I have addressed those comments.

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR updates the htaccess redirection to use a default value (master) and better handles requests coming in from different versions.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13740.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/faq/env_var.html - works\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/versions/master/faq/env_var.html - works\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/versions/1.4.0/faq/env_var.html - will redirect to master.\r\nLink to env var from http://34.201.8.176/faq/index.html#extend-and-contribute-to-mxnet goes to the productions website. There's still some hijacking code going on in the publish step that should be removed so development and testing is easier and less failure prone. So for now, you have to manually enter the address for any links you want to test.\r\nLike this one works fine: http://34.201.8.176/versions/master/faq/finetune.html or http://34.201.8.176/faq/finetune.html\r\n\r\nWith regard to why this issue is happening in the first place - I'm not sure. I'm seeing a lot of redirect issues, including the [404 page](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/error/404.html) totally crashing for too many redirects. [It works here in this preview](http://34.201.8.176/error/404.html). This all worked fine for many months and the htaccess file hasn't been touched in months, so 🤷‍♂️ - anyway this update seems to resolve the issue for now.\r\n\r\nPS - the [centos-gpu test finished but was hanging](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Fcentos-gpu/detail/PR-13796/1/pipeline/), so I restarted it. These successful runs but with hanging should be investigated!","created_at":"2019-01-08T02:13:15Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T16:42:36Z","closed_at":"2019-01-09T16:42:36Z","merged_at":"2019-01-09T16:42:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"71740ae4307a53682a25807f6e07561b90d97feb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708199304,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxOTkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Website","name":"Website","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/72f6a513b45fe12ff3a22183a40807ba7f311299","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:redirect_upgrade","ref":"redirect_upgrade","sha":"72f6a513b45fe12ff3a22183a40807ba7f311299","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Captcha OCR training and inference with unit tests for training\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nI ran this on both osx and ubuntu linux but only

Description ##\r\nThis PR reduces the number of cudaGetDevice/cudaSetDevice calls during Gluon execution. \r\nPreviously, during every call to allocate/free buffer in StorageManager DeviceStore would call cudaGetDevice and 2x cudaSetDevice (to get the current device, set the new device and lastly to set the original device again), even if no actual allocation took place (due to caching allocator usage).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n - This PR changes the DeviceStore so that cudaSetDevice calls are made only when necessary (when the new device is different than the original device)\r\n - This PR changes the Storage so that only the actual GPU and pinned CPU allocations are guarded by the DeviceStore - memory returned from allocator cache does not need to be guarded.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- There is 1 more place that introduces potentially needless calls to cudaSetDevice when using Gluon - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/engine/threaded_engine_perdevice.cc#L99 is called when temporary ThreadedOpr object is destroyed after either normal or bulked execution of ops. It seems though that this should be handled by caching of ThreadedOpr objects and engine variables (since destruction of them after every op seems to be quite costly). @eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\nReplace a hardcoded ratio in MultiBoxPrior with whatever user desired.\r\nIt was hardcoded to 1 by default, now it allow arbitrary value, even though ratio==1.0 is highly recommended in almost all circumstances for computer vision tasks. \r\n\r\nThis change does NOT affecting existing examples and use cases.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nOn Mac OSX, wget is conflicting with MXNet build (zlib), developer has to uninstall wget from Mac.\r\nCurrent scala example script using wget to download model and images, make it difficult to mac developers.\r\n\r\nThis change to workaround this issue form Mac users.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-02T21:55:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T16:52:34Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T00:22:15Z","merged_at":"2019-01-08T00:22:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b7fd15324de5958a375bdaf5101e19085c315bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

I try to train imagenet with this line commented, the train-accuracy reaches 99% while the validation-accuracy is only less than 50% (single machine, 8 GPUs, global batchsize=2048, Resnet50, fp32). Absolutely this is overfitting.\r\n\r\nThen I uncomment this line and try again with the same experiment settings. This time both train and validation accuracy converge to about 66%, which looks like normal result.\r\n\r\nThus, it seems that this data augmentation is pretty important for ImageNet training. Perhaps it will be better to uncomment this as default, so that future developers won't get confused by the overfitting issue.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-02T08:45:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-09T08:48:44Z","closed_at":"2019-06-09T08:48:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21e56b4718a0c4709ea4735b2aa53b7a1750e657","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is a continuation of PR #13362 started by @ptrendx titled \"Add NHWC layout support to Pooling (cuDNN only)\".  We're in agreement that I'm the best one to push this work forward to a point of final acceptance.\r\n\r\nBased on reviewer comments, I've expanded the support of the newly introduced 'layout' parameter to include cpu and cuda implementations, not just cudnn.  Also 3D support in cuDNN and graceful fallback for MKLDNN.  I've re-enabled and expanded the testing of test_operator_gpu.py:test_pooling_versions.  I understand and avoid the earlier flakiness of that test, which was due to inclusion of the pooling_v1 operator in some problem domains where its definition differs.  The initial commit here is identical to the last one made by @ptrendx for PR #13362.  Follow-up commits will add this new functionality and additional description.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-31T01:11:00Z","updated_at":"2019-02-16T23:17:34Z","closed_at":"2019-02-16T23:17:34Z","merged_at":"2019-02-16T23:17:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"5adb6fcfb3ea50c76d387e63ce367bbe8c3f18d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":850777570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTA3Nzc1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CUDA","name":"CUDA","color":"fc235d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Description ##\r\nFor distributed training, a new process is launched when importing the `kvstore_server` module. This should be imported at last so that other MXNet modules are initialized correctly. Otherwise this may result in error when unpickling custom LR scheduler/optimizers. For example, the LRScheduler in gluoncv https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv/blob/master/gluoncv/utils/lr_scheduler.py#L8 depends on a specific version of MXNet, and [checks the `__version__` attr of MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv/blob/master/gluoncv/__init__.py#L11), which is not set on kvstore server due to the fact that kvstore-server module is imported before the `__version__` attr is set. \r\n\r\n@hetong007 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nEnd to end tested with a gluon-cv example.

Description ##\r\nContinuing with the test code cleanup in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13553, there was an opportunity to make the test caller code more concise. There were 2 files for calling test for mxnet and gluon backend. This PR condenses it to 1 file for calling backend tests.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Use test suite and TestRunner to execute tests for different backends (mxnet/gluon) and operations (export/import)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Tested all import/export tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-27T23:26:47Z","updated_at":"2018-12-28T20:44:16Z","closed_at":"2018-12-28T20:44:15Z","merged_at":"2018-12-28T20:44:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f202afae5ee134cecc62ac30b5136b4315bcf77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":890967059,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTA5NjcwNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/ONNX","name":"ONNX","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdd mkldnn implement for slice OP\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n###

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nFix #13710 \r\n\r\nIn bipartite match, the temporary workspace size is miscalculated and not enough to hold the index tensor.\r\n\r\nSince it is related to `sizeof(DType)` and `sizeof(int32_t)`, the bug is only triggered on some platforms.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-25T07:00:10Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T07:49:34Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T01:00:51Z","merged_at":"2019-01-08T01:00:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"57843631c49d9222a97d8222c535b9475e6681bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nSmall fix on the issue that ndarray argmax doesn't support default axis for one dimension array\r\nDescription: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10358\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-24T21:54:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T02:36:10Z","closed_at":"2019-01-10T02:36:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"420a4851117bab795b9baf7a1177461ea24a85f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nExplicitly throw warning message on unsupported cases where `update_on_kvstore` is set to False. Previously, `self._update_on_kvstore` would be silently set to True even user constructed Trainer with `update_on_kvstore=False`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-23T06:51:48Z","updated_at":"2019-12-14T05:49:40Z","closed_at":"2018-12-29T21:10:42Z","merged_at":"2018-12-29T21:10:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"33cd0af0d005377ca3dc1c8656ea889bb19b512f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAddressing some user feedback on the documentation for ssd java example and some javadoc stuff. \r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\nMaking it more clear that in order to run the example, mxnet must first be built.\r\nFixing a few paths in the readme.\r\nAdding javadocs for ObjectDetectorOutput which is a basic POJO for working with the ObjectDetector inference api.\r\n\r\n@piyushghai @zachgk @lanking520 @aaronmarkham \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13711/1/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-21T06:41:13Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T22:45:55Z","closed_at":"2018-12-21T22:45:55Z","merged_at":"2018-12-21T22:45:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0180190152863b06ffd024203cdc1a0e3df32bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

Description ##\r\nThis PR is the second part of the maven Jenkins publishing that adds testing of the produced packages on 16.04, 18.04, and centOS. It also creates dedicated publishing dockerfiles (on 14.04) and testing dockerfiles that are built without any dependencies to ensure that the static linking worked properly. \r\n\r\nBecause the packages built on this do not yet use static linking, it instead tests against the snapshot repository. \r\n\r\nNote that this PR depends on (and is rebased on top of) #13450. When reviewing the files, please look at only the changes in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/d4ac689f1be50a1c5f519bce5eb7be0973fa1bad.\r\n\r\nPlease review so the pipeline can be put into production:\r\n@nswamy @lanking520 @andrewfayres @piyushghai @marcoabreu @yzhliu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nFor debugging reason TRT nodes attributes was cleared on the symbol copy returned by GetOptimizedSymbol.\r\n\r\nThis modification allow to save and load graph with TRT node using the following procedure:\r\n```\r\n# Save\r\nmx.contrib.tensorrt.set_use_tensorrt(True)\r\nexecutor = mx.contrib.tensorrt.tensorrt_bind(sym, ...)\r\nopti_sym = mx.contrib.tensorrt.get_optimized_symbol(executor)\r\nopti_sym.save('my_opti_sym')\r\n\r\n# Load\r\nmx.contrib.tensorrt.set_use_tensorrt(False)\r\nopti_sym = mx.sym.load('my_opti_sym')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Once saved, the model can be used with MXNET_USE_TENSORRT set to False.\r\n- When arg_params / aux_params are integrated to TRT_engine you don't need to reinitialize as they will be directly saved in the TRT node attributes. It's still on the user side to check if the weights are in the TRT_node or not, and initialize them properly on the later case\r\n- You still can't save using JSON as some serialized attributes may contain \"{\", \"}\" or \"EOF\".\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-20T19:37:25Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T02:10:17Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T02:10:16Z","merged_at":"2019-01-08T02:10:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f151fbbc00751a590ec2377377003b421c45dec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes

Description ##\r\nFix Issue #13658 \r\nThe variable `shape` in `DLTensor` is pointed to the `TShape` instance in `tblob_` in `NDArray`.\r\nHowever, the `NDArray` instance in `NDArrayDLManager` is different from the original `NDArray` instance.\r\n\r\nTest Case written by @jermainewang \r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tvm\r\n\r\ndef foo():\r\n  x = mx.nd.array([0, 5], dtype='int64')\r\n  dl = x.to_dlpack_for_read()\r\n  return tvm.nd.from_dlpack(dl)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n  y = foo()\r\n  y.asnumpy()\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n```bash\r\nfor i in {0..100}; do echo $i && python3 t.py || break ; done\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test is passed more than 300 times on Ubuntu 16.04.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Tiny Changes. The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `Fix NDArray::ToDLPack`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-20T04:21:08Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T18:03:55Z","closed_at":"2018-12-21T18:03:54Z","merged_at":"2018-12-21T18:03:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2115881235f66640c5a59810c0a523136b08963","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/56ff9ca665f0e9ec33f1a22f9726211832e1378d","head":{"label":"wkcn:fix_dlpack_bug","ref":"fix_dlpack_bug","sha":"56ff9ca665f0e9ec33f1a22f9726211832e1378d","user":{"login":"wkcn","id":3415417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3415417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn","html_url":"https://github.com/wkcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115596906,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1OTY5MDY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"wkcn/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wkcn","id":3415417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3415417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn","html_url":"https://github.com/wkcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wkcn/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nMajor changes:\r\n* Integrate mkldnn signed int8 convolution.\r\n* Introduce new quantization flow out_type `auto`, which automatically determines the out_type according to calibration information. If negative value is detected from calibration min, out_type will be int8, otherwise, out_type will be uint8.\r\n* Introduce new operator quantize_v2, which only has 1 input data and will self-calculate min/max in runtime or use calibration information set by attrs. Then calibration informations are all recorded in model file instead of part in params file. User can easily modify them without touching params file. This operator also used to implement out_type `auto`.\r\n* Add new parameter `monitor_all` for monitor module to allow monitoring both input & output of operators. This is used for collecting calibration information of in_data to support quantize first layer of graph.\r\n\r\n @pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @zheng-da @reminisce @azai91 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\nThe SGLD optimizer adds Gaussian noise to the weights updates. A comment about the need to set seed to replicate this noise was added to SGLD optimizer docstring.\r\n A test is also added for the SGLD optimizer and the test passes. The test must use set seeds to be able to compare opt1 and opt2 and compare_optimizer method is updated to allow for this.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New Split_v2 operator\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nAllow windows user to properly use `Dataset.transform_first` in combination with `num_workers > 0`\r\nThe original problem is caused by nested function which cannot be pickled in `transform_first`\r\n\r\nReproduceable following http://en.diveintodeeplearning.org/chapter_deep-learning-basics/fashion-mnist.html and set num_workers > 0 on windows machine\r\n\r\n- Removed nested function and use callable object instead.\r\n- Test case added\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR extends the `dev_menu.py` script to give it a docs build option. 🔥 \r\nIt leverages the existing `deploy_docs` function from CI that is basically a straight call to `make docs SPHINXOPTS=-W`. This will check your build for docs errors, so this makes it just a little more easier to test your dev work before making a PR.\r\n\r\nAs with any `make docs` run, make sure you update `/docs/settings.ini` to choose which doc sets to run, otherwise you're running them all! 😲 \r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nUnrelated to this change is that while getting the script to function, I noticed the script has a couple of deviations in requirements from a standard user installation of MXNet. These aren't in our user setup scripts:\r\n\r\n1. `yaml` Python module (pip install)\r\n2. `ccache` (apt install)\r\n\r\nSo to run this script you need these! \r\n\r\nI tried using a docker variation for giggles and ran into security issues at one point, so there are probably some additional config steps to make the docker options work for a regular user.\r\n\r\nIt also requires Python 3. It will fail to run on Python 2 (around line 75). I think that since we still support Python 2 the script should be updated accordingly. Again, this has nothing to do with this feature I'm adding. I'm just commenting on the current situation with the script that is already in the repo.\r\n\r\n## Experimental\r\nI experimented with adding an option to run the full website build since that would be pretty cool to offer for easy dev & testing, but I put that off after seeing that it's not quite setup to handle a bunch of parameters. Sure, it could be done, but I didn't want to make so many changes without discussing the best approach. I had a --website option going that took in the 5 params needed, but then found I'd need to rewrite/extend the commands functions, so I didn't. Saving this kind of update for later since I'd also like to make it easy to pick which doc set(s) to run (python/c/scala/java/clojure/r/etc). Ping me if anyone wants to help with that.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-19T01:12:11Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T14:31:12Z","closed_at":"2019-01-04T14:31:12Z","merged_at":"2019-01-04T14:31:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"0165ef4a01f9c2841e627d115bc68c4fa934667f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR
