adds an interface to the cuDNN RNN operator. Some issues:\n1. The forward pass in inference mode reproduces https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch\n2. The backward mode is currently not working, due to incorrect handling of dropout descriptor. Correct handling of the dropout state needs to be added.\n3. It doesn't currently inherit the MXNet seed for dropout. How is this seed accessed?\n4. This symbol currently only supports data in form [seq length, batch, input size], which is the native cuDNN format. Should add support for [batch, seq, input] as well, but will probably require a temp state + transpose.\n5. Gives an option to return multiple outputs (output + 2 states for LSTM, 1 for others). By default only a single output is returned, but sometimes you require access to the output states (eg generating text).\n6. Currently only support the CUDNN_LINEAR_INPUT option for cudnnRNNInputMode_t.\n7. Uses a single parameter vector. It will be useful to have a Python script to convert this to a dictionary of NDArray's giving each weight + bias for each layer.\n\nSee also:

When a worker node died and restarts, it can join the cluster again. This PR https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite/pull/59 need to be merged first\n-  Timeout for ps scheduler and servers for _Spark_. PS scheduler and servers are started in a spawned process. But when something goes wrong, e.g., workers, servers or the scheduler crash, they will have no chance to stop themselves. I think the simplest way to solve this problem is to set a timeout T, if the scheduler/server does not receive any message in T seconds, stop itself.\n\nRelated to
