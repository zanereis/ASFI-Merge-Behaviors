this PR a builtin for incremental sliceline was added and incorporated in SystemDS. The builtin currently does not work as intended, as it is only meant to provide the overall structure for further development. The function currently does mostly the same as the original non-incremental SliceFinder builtin. It was, however, extended to be able to receive a lattice of slices, which was output on a previous run of the algorithm, the corresponding statistics from the previous run, and the whole feature matrix as a combination of all prior input feature matrices. Further on, the function now outputs the lattice, which was computed within the algorithm, the corresponding statistics and the combined original and new feature matrices to use in the next runs. Also JUNIT tests were added that compare the results of incSliceLine with the ones of SliceFinder. \r\n\r\nContributor:\r\nFrederic

noticed that the fallback implementation for sparse-dense matrix multiply produces wrong results or sometimes throws an index out of bounds exception. This patch fixes this issue. Further, this part of the code is only reached when LOW_LEVEL_OPTIMIZATION is set to false (by default it is true). Hence, this is bug should generally not occur.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nA %*% B = C , where A is in sparse format, B and C are dense.\r\n\r\nA = {{1, 0, 2, 0},                        \r\n\t{0, 1, 0, 0},\r\n\t{0, 0, 3, 0},\r\n\t{0, 5, 0, 0}}\r\n\r\nB = {{1, 2, 3, 4},\r\n\t{5, 6, 7, 8},\r\n\t{9, 10, 11, 12},\r\n\t{13, 14, 15, 16}}\r\n\r\nFor A utilizing CSR, it throws and out of bound exception and when using MCSR it produced a wrong result. I will check if this or similar errors occur in other matrix multiply operators (specifically those called when LOW_LEVEL_OPTIMIZATION is true).

commits add the full integration of ResNets. The forward passes for the basic residual block architecture (ResNet18 & 34) have been previously added. These commits add the forward passes for the bottleneck architecture (ResNet50, 101 & 152) and the backward passes for all architectures.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since the iteration through the model parameters, especially for the bigger models, gets quite complex, I implemented utiltiy functions for the updating the parameters with differen optimizers. For each model and for each optimizer, a uitlity method to initialize the optimizer state parameters and to update the model parameters have been added.\r\n\r\nThere is also an example added which uses random data to showcase the full training loop of the ResNets (forward, backward, param updating). The example uses ResNet18 but can changed by simply modifying the import statement to another model. Also, the ADAM optimizer is used but I also added all the other optimizers in the example and can be used by uncommenting the respective lines. The example was tested for all ResNets (18, 34, 50, 101, 152) and for all optimizers. Every combination trains correctly (i.e. the loss shrinks).\r\n\r\nAbout testing, I've added comprehensive testing for the forward and backward pass of the residual blocks (basic and bottleneck architectures) and for the residual layer's forward pass (multiple residual blocks) but not for the residual layer backward pass and the full networks because the example data would take up to much space.","created_at":"2024-03-30T18:39:12Z","updated_at":"2024-03-30T19:21:27Z","closed_at":"2024-03-30T19:21:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d2148fb9cd28cc269766aa4cb27d5e6f1e555ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2010/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2010/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2010/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/ec893645a0b48011c6bc9aa538b3f1c899c27594","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:resnetpr2","ref":"resnetpr2","sha":"ec893645a0b48011c6bc9aa538b3f1c899c27594","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

pull request introduces a new iterator designed to enhance our sparse block handling capabilities. Unlike the default IJV iterator, which iterates over all non-zero cells, this iterator focuses on the indexes of non-zero rows—skipping entirely zero rows. In a subsequent task, I will use this iterator to investigate which improvements the DCSR representation can bring over other representations like CSR in a number of key operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, unary aggregates). The new iterator supports the all four sparse formats: DCSR, MCSR, CSR, and COO. Testing has been added.\r\n\r\n**Usage Example:**\r\n```\r\nSparseBlock block = ...; // Assume block is initialized\r\nIterator<Integer> iter = block.getIteratorNonZeroRows();\r\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\r\n    int rowIndex = iter.next();\r\n    // Process non-zero row at rowIndex\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-26T15:00:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T16:09:36Z","closed_at":"2024-03-25T16:09:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71d8d4378a3a8ca142463bd0dd501a1c75d5ab90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/208dfa3ade5f2f21a385134d24ba210405fd8951","head":{"label":"ReneEnjilian:non-zero-rows-iterator","ref":"non-zero-rows-iterator","sha":"208dfa3ade5f2f21a385134d24ba210405fd8951","user":{"login":"ReneEnjilian","id":38861000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODYxMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38861000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian","html_url":"https://github.com/ReneEnjilian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703796657,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfMVsQ","name":"systemds","full_name":"ReneEnjilian/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ReneEnjilian","id":38861000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODYxMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38861000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian","html_url":"https://github.com/ReneEnjilian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ReneEnjilian/systemds","description":"An

Overview\r\nPython tests for the FFT and IFFT implementations were added. Also validation checks were added that should hopefully filter out all edge cases. Handling of zero matrix inputs and empty matrices was also implemented. This PR has been rebased on the main PR that implements FFT and IFFT and integrates it into DML. Thus it has to be merged after this PR.  See https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1983. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nRun the tests in systemds/src/main/python/tests/matrix/test_fft.py and see if they are all going through. The tests can be run by doing the following: \r\n### Go to the root of the project. Then run:\r\n```\r\npython3.8 -m venv venv\r\nsource venv/bin/activate \r\n```\r\n\r\n### make sure to set the following env variables in your venv:\r\n```\r\nexport SYSTEMDS_ROOT=$(pwd)\r\nexport PATH=$SYSTEMDS_ROOT/bin:$PATH\r\nexport SYSDS_QUIET=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Then run:\r\n```\r\npip install --upgrade pip\r\npip install wheel numpy py4j scipy scikit-learn requests pandas unittest-parallel\r\nmvn clean package -P distribution    \r\ncd src/main/python/\r\npython create_python_dist.py\r\npython -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_fft.py'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For deactivating the venv run:\r\n`deactivate`\r\n\r\nAfter validating the tests review the code for the validation and check if any edge cases might be missing in systemds/src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/parser/BuiltinFunctionExpression.java and also check the handling of non-zero matrices in systemds/src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/runtime/matrix/data/LibCommonsMath.java.

Bug fix for memory estimates of dedup block\r\n- optimised recalc of nnz for dedup block\r\n- add stats for spark broadcast for transformapply encoder\r\n- added accurate mem estimate for transform apply's wordembedding in ParameterizedBuiltinOp.java\r\n\r\nBuilt-in LSTM Operator for CP\r\n- the LSTM operators interface is similar to the equivalent lstm dml script \r\n- forward pass and backward pass, generic for all underlying matrix block representations\r\n- forward pass with specific optimization for mini batches on FP64 by operator fusing and loop tiling\r\n- the generic backward pass  differs from the lstm dml script instructions that it replaced the expensive left-indexing operations (which really boosts the performance for use cases witch large sequences [T>100]) and more efficient reusing of already computed subresults\r\n- test cases for checking functionality with comparison lstm dml script\r\n\r\nI left TODOs for future optimizations:\r\n- for the generic backward: fusion of operators for single threaded execution -> parallelize over input batch rows\r\n- implementation for an LSTM operation that exploits DedupBlocks (forward and backward)\r\n\r\nI conducted performance measurements on a single node with 48 vcores and 210gb heap with different batch sizes and input dimensions and random dense inputs, which showed general performance improvements of 2x. \r\nFor a small input dimensions (32) and a small number LSTM Cells (32), the optimized forward pass even showed improvements up to 10x. Additionally the experiments showed the better performance for long sequences (T=1000) of 4-6x, through the fusion of operations over the \"time axis\" for a subsets of rows the input

commits add the full integration of ResNets. \r\n\r\nThe forward passes for the basic residual block architecture (ResNet18 & 34) have been previously added. These commits add the forward passes for the bottleneck architecture (ResNet50, 101 & 152) and the backward passes for all architectures.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since the iteration through the model parameters, especially for the bigger models, gets quite complex, I implemented utiltiy functions for the updating the parameters with differen optimizers. For each model and for each optimizer, a uitlity method to initialize the optimizer state parameters and to update the model parameters have been added.\r\n\r\nThere is also an example added which uses random data to showcase the full training loop of the ResNets (forward, backward, param updating). The example uses ResNet18 but can changed by simply modifying the import statement to another model. Also, the ADAM optimizer is used but I also added all the other optimizers in the example and can be used by uncommenting the respective lines. \r\nThe example was tested for all ResNets (18, 34, 50, 101, 152) and for all optimizers. Every combination trains correctly (i.e. the loss shrinks).\r\n\r\nAbout testing, I've added comprehensive testing for the forward and backward pass of the residual blocks (basic and bottleneck architectures) and for the residual layer's forward pass (multiple residual blocks) but not for the residual layer backward pass and the full networks because the example data would take up to much space.\r\n\r\n@Baunsgaard

a script implementing tSNE with a pca-preprocessed input data.\r\n\r\nThis script implements the concept used in sklearn's tSNE, where they provide the option of pre-processing the input data with pca before giving them to the tSNE algorithm. For very large datasets, this could theoretically improve tSNE performance by removing a large portion of noise prior to the core algorithm. However, the current implementation does not speed up tSNE when applied on MNIST, so further research required to confirm

a tolerance parameter to tSNE and implemented an early-stopping mechanism based on the L1 norm of the difference. Furthermore I also added a test case, whose setup guarantees that the early-stopping mechanism is triggered.\r\n\r\nWithout early-stopping, tSNE always runs 1000 iterations (based on the default parameter value). More often than not, this leads to redundant iterations, where changes are minimal. This mechanism is a good addition as it adds a dimension of flexibility to the algorithm.","created_at":"2024-01-26T09:25:20Z","updated_at":"2024-02-09T05:05:44Z","closed_at":"2024-02-09T05:05:44Z","merged_at":"2024-02-09T05:05:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"60a2acbf4bcfcb1e41a1c12be05504ffafa02720","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/milestones/1/labels","id":10261193,"node_id":"MI_kwDOArxUbc4AnJLJ","number":1,"title":"systemds-3.2.0","description":"All

pull request implements a simplification rewrite for the, input pattern `(A%*%B) + (A%*%C)`. The resulting rewrite is `A%*%(B+C)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the rewrite to be applied a number of conditions need to be fulfilled. All three matrices `A`, `B`, and `C` have to be dense and certain properties like the number-of-non-zeros (`NNZ`) need to be available. Further, the rewrite is only applied if the number of floating point operations is actually reduced by the rewrite. Testing has been added.

description of the bug:\r\n\r\nUsual Behavior of SystemDS:\r\n- When: A function returns an object and this object is assigned the variable name \"blub\".\r\n- And: A variable named \"blub\" already exists in the execution context.\r\n- Then: Variable object should be replaced with new returned object and the old object should be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nBug:\r\n- When: Old object and new object of variable named \"blub\" are lists and both contain the same element A.\r\n- And: There is no other reference to A in the execution context.\r\n- Then: The mutual list element will be cleaned up and its cached data deleted even though it is still in the new list. This happens since the new object isn't added to the execution context when cleaning up. Otherwise, the reference to A would be detected and its cached data not deleted.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be seen when executing the newly added DML script. \r\n\r\nThe solution for this is to only clean up the old objects after having removed all old objects from and added all new objects to the execution context. This way, the cached data of the mutual list elements will not be deleted since the clean up always checks whether there is another reference in the execution context to that element.\r\n\r\nTesting has been added.","created_at":"2024-01-19T18:08:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-22T13:29:14Z","closed_at":"2024-01-22T13:29:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"607561346b5cc32aee164fdcc33babbc8a2197db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/milestones/1/labels","id":10261193,"node_id":"MI_kwDOArxUbc4AnJLJ","number":1,"title":"systemds-3.2.0","description":"All

Overview \r\n\r\nJava functions for FFT and IFFT for one and 2dimensional inputs were added and integrated into DML.  The IFFT and FFT DML functions both are currently only implemented for real inputs. An exemplory dml script can be found in tmp/test.dml. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n Tests were added, as well. One test is meant to compare the correctness and speed of the FFT implementation with the corresponding numpy implementation. To run this test (to be found in FourierTestWithFiles.java) run the python script in FourierTestData.py and copy the generated files to the root of the

pull request introduces an implementation of a pipeline-aware linearization algorithm. \r\nIt extends on the idea of [SYSTEMDS-3290] by marking the low-level operations for asynchronous execution. It achieves this by creating groups of Lops (pipelines) that are identified to be run in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces only the marking of the operations; not the asynchronous execution itself.\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Pipeline-Aware Linearization\r\n- Inclusion of new Linearization-Algorithm into existing test cases.\r\n- Creation of new Test-Class for the new _ILinearize_

commit optimize the lazy write buffer to pass through byte arrays if provided instead of lazily evaulating them. If provided byte arrays are large enough this is faster than the previous lazy evaluation. Especially because we previously copied over the byte array allocating the elements twice, This commit also fixes a bug where if you provide a byte array that is larger than the buffer it does not

this first PR, I have implemented the internals for the DCSR Layout. I used the CSR implementation as a template and modified the code starting from there. However, as the additional row-index array generates some overhead (additional binary search for finding rows) I adapted many functions to work more efficiently. However, there is still some inefficient code left. Furthermore, I removed CSR-specific functions to accelerate value insertion. \r\n\r\nI have extended the Unit-Tests in the `test/component/sparse` folder to test my Matrix Block. However, some functions are not covered by these tests. \r\n\r\nI have included some comments starting with `// TODO:`. These are open questions and notes that should be looked into @mboehm7

patch improves the builtin dist function by removing the outer product operator. For 100 function calls on an arbitrary matrix with 4000 rows and 800 cols, the new dist function shortens the runtime from 66.541s to 60.268s.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment was run with varying rows and cols size:\r\n```\r\nX = rand(rows=4000, cols=800, min=-1, max=1, seed=42)\r\n\r\nfor (i in 1:100){\r\n    Y = new_distance_matrix(X)\r\n}\r\n\r\nprint( sum(Y) )\r\n\r\n\r\nnew_distance_matrix =

commit adds a Python Library for time-series alignment. The library supports alignment for video datasets and time-series (i.e. sensor data). It implements different alignment strategies from static to dynamic alignment and provides different similarity measures that can be used in the alignment process. The alignment strategies are tested on a synthetic dataset that can be found in the `data`

was previously not supporting nested lists correctly since the data of CacheableData objects within nested loops were always deleted after a function call. \r\nNormally, there are rmvar statements after function calls to remove alll variables used within the function. To protect CacheableData objects (e.g. matrices) from having their data removed by the rmvar statements we use a cleanup-enabled flag. This flag was not correctly set for variables that were within a nested list. These commits fix this problem by flagging all elements, also within nested lists.\r\n\r\nAutomated tests have been added to test the changes.\r\n\r\n@phaniarnab

a built in graph convolutional layer to our nn layer diretory. The graph convolutional layer follows the paper \"Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks\" from Kipf and Welling. This includes the forward and the backward pass of the layer and an example network on how to use the layers. \r\n\r\nWe tested the implementation against PyTorch and our implementation computes the same exact values as PyTorch does and handles missing in-bound edges of a node the same way in the spectral convolution. This is also implemented as a component test as a NNComponentTest. There we hard-coded the initialized weights from PyTorch and the result into the component test.

pull request for the implementation of the ResNet architecture as a builtin network of SystemDS.\r\nResNets consists of residual blocks. There are two types of blocks - basic blocks and bottleneck blocks. Basic blocks are used in the smaller ResNets 18 and 34.\r\nThese commits add the forward pass of the basic blocks and provide testing for them as a NNComponentTest.\r\nThe testing is done by, first, testing for the correct handling of dimension throughout the residual bock. Secondly, we test for correct computation of the actual values of the output by using the torchvision.models.resnet.BasicBlock of PyTorch which is there implementation of the basic block for the ResNets 18 and 34. We let PyTorch randomly initialize all weights and then hard-code these weights into the component test with the expected values as
