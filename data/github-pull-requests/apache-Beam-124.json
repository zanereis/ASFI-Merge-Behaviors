script was broken when editing Dataflow container versions.\r\n\r\n - `set_version.sh 2.29.0 --release` would set the version to just `beam-` without the version\r\n - `set_version.sh 2.30.0` really shouldn't modify it because when we move to the next version\r\n   on the main branch we keep the same `beam-master-<date>` container.\r\n - Go was not included, because the script was not used by the

users are required to provide `numShards` or `shardingFn` for streaming writes. This PR adds an internal option `withRunnerDeterminedShardingUnboundedInternal` to `WriteFiles` transform for runners to perform dynamic sharding for unbounded data. So if a runner supports it, users can also use `withRunnerDeterminedSharding` for streaming processing.\r\n\r\nThis PR reuses the existing `withRunnerDeterminedSharding` in `WriteFiles` for unbounded data, i.e., no new user visible option added. Unless a runner overrides the new option added by the PR, users who try to use `withRunnerDeterminedSharding` for unbounded data will get an error, so in other words the new option has not effect for now.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR addresses an issue in doctests where the output expression wasn't being run through PartitioningSession.

Most of the remaining changes are addressing the resulting compliance failures.\r\n\r\nThe final commit, 0947055, adds an ugly hack to make sure that frames with multiindexes evaluate equally,

modifies the ordering defined by is_subpartitioning_of from:\r\n```\r\nNothing() < Index([i]) < Index([i, j]) < ... < Index() < Singleton()\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nSingleton() < Index([i]) < Index([i, j]) < ... < Index() < Nothing()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is more logical, since `Singleton()` is equivalent to `Index([])`. The rest of the PR deals with the fallout from this change, which largely entails updating `preserves_partition_by` specs for computed expressions (e0aba2d), and updating the logic for fusing stages (29f41c0). It also includes a patch to have `Index.check` make a strong assertion about partioning, as discussed in BEAM-11324 (29f41c0), and removes the \"difficulty\" ordering key used in `PartitioningSession`, as this is now equivalent to the standard ordering.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

is the same change as PR #14083, which was merged successfully.\r\n\r\nHowever, when PR #14084 was merged, one unintended effect was that the change from #14083 got reversed. This is potentially explained by the following: The change in #14083 had unintentionally moved into #14084 and one of the commits in #14084 was reversing that stray change. The merge commit for #14084 (b7125d0) in addition to the single file that was intended for #14084 also added this reversal commit.\r\n\r\nR: @ibzib \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#13658 intended to enable strict dependency checking for everything under runners/flink, but it missed runners/flink/job-server.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to have introduced unnecessary changes to
