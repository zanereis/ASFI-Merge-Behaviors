href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.62.0</h2>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>grpc: Add StaticMethod CallOption as a signal to stats handler that a method is safe to use as an instrument key (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6986\">#6986</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Behavior Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>grpc: Return canonical target string from ClientConn.Target() and resolver.Address.String() (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6923\">#6923</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>server: wait to close connection until incoming socket is drained (with timeout) to prevent data loss on client-side (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6977\">#6977</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/s-matyukevich\"><code>@​s-matyukevich</code></a> for discovering the root cause</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Performance Improvements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>*: Allow building without <code>x/net/trace</code> by using <code>grpcnotrace</code> to enable dead code elimination (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6954\">#6954</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/hugelgupf\"><code>@​hugelgupf</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>rand: improve performance and simplify implementation of <code>grpcrand</code> by adopting <code>math/rand</code>'s top-level functions for go version 1.21.0 and newer. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6925\">#6925</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/kmirzavaziri\"><code>@​kmirzavaziri</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Dependencies</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>*: Use google.golang.org/protobuf/proto instead of github.com/golang/protobuf. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6919\">#6919</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/Clement-Jean\"><code>@​Clement-Jean</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]\nThe above change in proto library usage introduces a minor behavior change within those libraries.  The old <code>github.com/golang/protobuf</code> library would error if given a <code>nil</code> message to <code>Marshal</code>, while the new <code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> library will successfully output zero bytes in this case.  This means server method handlers that did <code>return nil, nil</code> will now return an empty message and no error, while it used to return an error.  This also affects the client side, where clients sending <code>nil</code> messages used to fail without sending the RPC, and now they will send an empty message.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.61.1</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>server: wait to close connection until incoming socket is drained (with timeout) to prevent data loss on client-side (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6977\">#6977</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/s-matyukevich\"><code>@​s-matyukevich</code></a> for discovering the root cause</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/d715b2ef0602fe2133221519cba0642ac282cc3f\"><code>d715b2e</code></a> Change version to 1.62.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6994\">#6994</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/d706a42d29ab785cc1ad86a09fe828ef0a196f26\"><code>d706a42</code></a> cherry-pick <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6926\">#6926</a> to 1.62 release branch (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6986\">#6986</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/8a4ca0cc41ceb5bd0763c865cc4094650df9f95f\"><code>8a4ca0c</code></a> cherry-pick <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6977\">#6977</a> to 1.62.x release branch (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6979\">#6979</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/d41b01db97ca2e3627b2c9949fffe8f152a4255d\"><code>d41b01d</code></a> encoding: fix typo (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6966\">#6966</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/c2b50ee081682eca4b995d2fb79e642019f78aea\"><code>c2b50ee</code></a> deps: fix backwards compatibility with encoding (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6965\">#6965</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/05b4a8b8f779518bb0119042c8c5806fa33d2184\"><code>05b4a8b</code></a> Revert &quot;xds/googlec2p: use xdstp names for LDS (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6949\">#6949</a>)&quot; (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6964\">#6964</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/03e76b3d2a467a6deebabe2b323780a1890e36d4\"><code>03e76b3</code></a> grpc: add ability to compile with or without tracing (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6954\">#6954</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/84b85babc00b4b8460e53b6ee110bfb49e9311cf\"><code>84b85ba</code></a> xds/googledirectpath: Check if ipv6 address is non empty (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6959\">#6959</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/6f63f05a5b98c484020c143d69450e8679603953\"><code>6f63f05</code></a> internal/grpcrand: use Go top-level random functions for go1.21+ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6925\">#6925</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/commit/cd69b5d0af6bd46ca17b94acaa09256a863ac277\"><code>cd69b5d</code></a> .*: fix minor linter issues (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6958\">#6958</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/compare/v1.61.0...v1.62.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=google.golang.org/grpc&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=1.61.0&new-version=1.62.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

is a continuation of the following PRs:\r\n- #30345\r\n- #30344\r\n- #30327\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug with issue creation for grafana alerts and the following changes have been added:\r\n- Enhanced the logic to determine if the threshold has been exceeded and moved from Grafana to the `github_runs_prefetcher` script\r\n- If the issue was closed, only consider new workflow runs after the issue's `closed_at` date\r\n- Changed Grafana alert rule to \"alert per row\"\r\n- Re-open the issue if the workflow became flaky again\r\n\r\n### How has it been tested?\r\n\r\nTested on the fork

is a very large class.  This breaks out the active work refresh and invalidating commit logic ( async work management) to another class.\r\n\r\nInitial implementation is what currently exists today.  There will be another implementation of `refreshActiveWork()` later for direct path, but this PR lays the ground work for it.

PR adds support for Vertex AI Feature Store with Bigtable online serving and legacy feature store.\r\nIt builds on top of the #30001 that added the handler for Bigtable.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nhandler = VertexAIFeatureStoreEnrichmentHandler(project=PROJECT_ID,\r\n                                                location=STORE_INSTANCE_REGION,\r\n                                                api_endpoint=ENDPOINT,\r\n                                                feature_store_name=STORE_NAME,\r\n                                                feature_view_name=VIEW_NAME,\r\n                                                row_key=KEY_IN_INPUT_ROW_WITH_UNIQUE_ID,                                                                                     \r\n                                                )\r\n\r\nwith beam.Pipeline() as p:\r\n  _ = (p\r\n       | \"Create Data\" >> beam.Create(data)\r\n       |  ... transforms ...\r\n       | \"Enrich Data\" >> Enrichment(handler)\r\n       | ... transforms ...\r\n      )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Optimized Serving and Vector Retrieval are in [preview launch](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/overview#online_feature_serving_and_vector_retrieval_of_data_with_preview) from Vertex AI which uses the `aiplatform_v1beta` version of library. Once these are launched from beta, I'll update the client to use that library. \r\n\r\nNothing should change for the user-interface but just the internal of handler where we set up and call the client. I tried this with beta library and it works but I would prefer to not depend on beta library at this point. We will need a different handler for Vector Retrieval case but Optimized Serving can be covered with the existing `VertexAIFeatureStoreEnrichmentHandler`.\r\n\r\nPart of #30386\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

an issue with SpannerIO.readChangeStream() where the pipeline credential (provided in the pipeline options) is not  being used by the initial getDialect call, which can result in an UNAUTHENTICATED error when accessing Spanner.\r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n- Support setting credentials in SpannerConfig.\r\n- In SpannerIO.readChangeStream(), if no credential is set in SpannerConfig, use the credential from the pipeline options for authenticating with Spanner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
