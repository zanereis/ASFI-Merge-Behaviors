sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR aims to refactor presto hook by replacing the pyhive client with prestosql official client. Now presto hook also supports transactions. Users can specify the type of transaction in the presto connection by setting the extra field isolation_level.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI've modified some tests of presto_hook to support the new client.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-15T12:02:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T11:39:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-19T11:39:39Z","merged_at":"2019-12-19T11:39:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"30c693c91a501c47f4ad594d1bc7303733b31cba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0d49cecaf6e38923344840699df875614e6b6574","head":{"label":"gaurav8297:master","ref":"master","sha":"0d49cecaf6e38923344840699df875614e6b6574","user":{"login":"gaurav8297","id":20029138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDI5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20029138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav8297","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227675752,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjc2NzU3NTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"gaurav8297/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaurav8297","id":20029138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDI5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20029138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav8297","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav8297/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: \r\nThis PR aims to refactor presto hook by replacing the pyhive client with prestosql official client. Now presto hook also supports transactions. Users can specify the type of transaction in the presto connection by setting the extra field `isolation_level`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: \r\nI've modified some tests of presto_hook to support the new client.\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-14T21:44:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-15T11:57:10Z","closed_at":"2019-12-15T11:57:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17f8ccf1547df9edb4a31ca77dfbd9a9f31328d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7ac2728d71b33cbc4a7f28a6695a29354160354a","head":{"label":"gaurav8297:master","ref":"master","sha":"7ac2728d71b33cbc4a7f28a6695a29354160354a","user":{"login":"gaurav8297","id":20029138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDI5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20029138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav8297","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227675752,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjc2NzU3NTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"gaurav8297/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaurav8297","id":20029138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDI5MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20029138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav8297","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav8297/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav8297/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR aims to refactor Redis Hook and all classes (sensors/operators) which are using it. So far every component used Redis Hook by interfacing directly with redis client. This change adds dedicated hook methods to interact with Redis and moves away from interfacing with redis client directly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI've extended tests/contrib/hooks/test_redis_hook.py and refactored tests/contrib/operators/test_redis_pub_sub_operator.py, tests/contrib/sensors/test_redis_sensor.py and tests/contrib/sensors/test_redis_pub_sub_sensor.py to align with added hook methods. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-14T20:13:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T19:57:40Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T19:57:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5618fc341e1aa71a5cd622ff1326d53fde00cae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdding details on how to set variables in code, as it's often a question found on SOF and not answered in Airflow docs \r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/54045048/with-code-how-do-you-update-an-airflow-variable\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: just adding docs\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6254)\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6254\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen BaseHook.get_connection is called, it calls conn.log_info() on the returned conn object.\r\n\r\nThis is prints to log the full contents of conn.extra.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because there can be sensitive information in conn.extra.\r\n\r\nThe present change resolves this by adding method conn.log_info which obscures extra, and calling that in get_connection instead of debug_info.\r\n\r\nThe debug_info method itself is left unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nInsignificant change, no new functionality\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-14T06:32:33Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T22:00:57Z","closed_at":"2019-12-14T09:28:50Z","merged_at":"2019-12-14T09:28:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6425a4be9c17bdcb4cbb134c3f19f1cff1c2e38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6817/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6817/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6817/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/93a1fda451a4ec0779ead139b8a26cf9114d06f7","head":{"label":"dstandish:feature/obscure-extras-in-conn-debug-info","ref":"feature/obscure-extras-in-conn-debug-info","sha":"93a1fda451a4ec0779ead139b8a26cf9114d06f7","user":{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189357608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkzNTc2MDg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"dstandish/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6250\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\non_failure_callback almost always want to know the dag_id and taskinstance that failed. These info are in the context passed to on_failure_callback, which is passed in from handle_failure(). However, in some rare scenarios, if handle_failure is called in scheduler_job.py and backfill_job.py, the only argument passed is the error message. context is left as None. \r\n\r\nSo in these cases, on_failure_callback will not even know what's the dag_id of the dag that just failed. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by setting context to get_template_context() if it's not given. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded test in test_taskinstance.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-13T08:27:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T12:55:48Z","closed_at":"2019-12-16T09:55:51Z","merged_at":"2019-12-16T09:55:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"1006740aa92d584cfb0317c922184ef758bf108a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8e7305e928394df811c069c2958ed625c68e519b","head":{"label":"yuqian90:fix_no_context","ref":"fix_no_context","sha":"8e7305e928394df811c069c2958ed625c68e519b","user":{"login":"yuqian90","id":6637585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6637585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqian90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205128417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDUxMjg0MTc=","name":"airflow","full_name":"yuqian90/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuqian90","id":6637585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6637585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqian90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuqian90/airflow","description":"Apache

Design / PR notes and RFC\r\n\r\n- open to commentary on the general design and approach applied in this PR\r\n  - the intention is to preserve existing functionality, as is, with minor tweaks\r\n- AFAICT, the public API is backwards compatible, unless noted in UPDATING.md\r\n  - most changes are refactoring private methods\r\n  - this adds new features to the public API\r\n- for RFC, please ignore most details of the implementation, just add commentary to the conversation; if a slack discussion would help, ping me to setup a time (Pacific standard time)\r\n- if it mostly looks OK, go ahead and give it a review\r\n  - LMK if it would be easier to split this out into stacked PRs, but hopefully it's clear enough, although large\r\n  - LMK if this requires additional integration testing (and how to do that easily)\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6245\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/1915\r\n  - https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/1921\r\n  - While working on this PR, I also pushed up https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/1921 and I'm not entirely sure how this PR and that one can change the landscape of waiting/polling on batch jobs, but this PR for Airflow will likely stand on its own for Airflow custom options\r\n\r\n- While developing this PR, thoughts about custom options for async waiters lingered in the background.  This PR may not be the place to introduce that (it might follow on from this PR), but it's worth noting here that work on a base async operator is in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6210\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the batch job status polling by using exponential backoff with jitter, see\r\n- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a utility for generating and using custom waiters for the AWS batch service; see also:\r\n- https://www.2ndwatch.com/blog/use-waiters-boto3-write/\r\n- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/clients.html#waiters\r\n- This PR removes a dependency on a botocore change to the waiter for AWS batch jobs that has not been merged and released for several years, i.e.\r\n  - https://github.com/boto/botocore/pull/1307\r\n\r\nThe utility for creating custom waiters can accept a waiter config to generate a custom waiter model.  This should allow users to specify any waiter model required for their use cases, which should satisfy https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6245 when the custom waiter can be plugged into the AWS batch operator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds unit tests for the generator of custom waiters for the AWS batch service\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-13T01:58:42Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T19:58:01Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T10:52:29Z","merged_at":"2020-01-08T10:52:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"78d8fe6944b689b9b0af99255286e34e06eedec3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6243\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n1.Optimize NamedHivePartitionSensor:\r\n\r\nExisting poke function:\r\nEach poke will poke all partitions not landed in NamedHivePartitionSensor.partition_names. If there are 10 partitions not landed, the poke will keep poking these 10 partitions until there are more partitions landed. \r\n\r\nOptimization:\r\nReturn false when the first not landed partition detected by poke_partition function. Save the index for this partition as the poke_start_index.  Do not try to poke partitions after that.\r\nIn each round of poke, the sensor will start with the partition at poke_start_index which implies the partition was not landed before. If the partition still not landed, sensor will return without creating more traffic to the hive metastore. Thus avoid overloading the metastore by repeatedly poking all not landed partitions in all executes.\r\n\r\nAssume the number of initial partition_names is n, the poke times before all partitions landed is T. \r\n  For existing poke function: the poke_partition function will be called **O(n * T)** times. On average the number of partitions not landed should be ~n/2.\r\n  For optimized poke function:  poke_partition function will be called **O(n) + T** times in most cases.\r\n\r\n2. If a partition was landed, being poked by a sensor, deleted right after that, the sensor will not poke it again and will return true after the rest partitions detected. For some long running sensor, there is a risk that at the time sensor return True some partitions may be deleted.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n@KevinYang21

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe current template (`script.py.mako`) for the migration script would fail the isort check. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCurrent static check (isort) checks the generated file.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

dag_ids get parameter to last_dagruns endpoint so can filter by the\r\nset of dag_ids present on the dags view. This is intended to speed up\r\nthe response time on systems running a large number of dags.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6239\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe last_dagruns endpoint returns all dags by default. This can result in an extremely slow response time when you have a lot of dags (In our case 1500+ takes 8 seconds).\r\n\r\nThe accompanying pull request adds a dag_ids get parameter to the last_dagruns end point which is populated by the dags present on the page.\r\n\r\nPlease see related and merged issue for task_stats: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6095\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\n\r\n(see test_views)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6238\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe dag_stats endpoint returns all dags by default. This can result in an extremely large payload ~ 3mb and slow response time when you have a lot of dags (In our case 1500+).\r\n\r\nThe accompanying pull request adds a dag_ids get parameter to the dag_stats end point which is populated by the dags present on the page.\r\n\r\nPlease see related and merged issue for task_stats: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6095\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6212\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6214\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- As the Jira issue described, if users set the connection URL by system environemnt, for example: `AIRFLOW_CONN_SPARK_DEFAULT=spark://localhost:7077`,   conn_data['master'] does not contain `'spark://'` this scheme prefix.\r\n\r\nDue to the source code, \r\n```\r\n           if conn.port:\r\n                conn_data['master'] = \"{}:{}\".format(conn.host, conn.port)\r\n            else:\r\n                conn_data['master'] = conn.host\r\n```\r\nif there is `uri` instance variable in `Connection` (the value of AIRFLOW_CONN_SPARK_DEFAULT will be passing as uri),  \"spark://\" will be not in `conn.host`. This is related to this snippet in `Connection` class, as the output of `parse_netloc_to_hostname` return only hostname without scheme(`\"spark://\"`):\r\n```   \r\n   def parse_from_uri(self, uri):\r\n        uri_parts = urlparse(uri)\r\n        conn_type = uri_parts.scheme\r\n        if conn_type == 'postgresql':\r\n            conn_type = 'postgres'\r\n        elif '-' in conn_type:\r\n            conn_type = conn_type.replace('-', '_')\r\n        self.conn_type = conn_type\r\n        self.host = parse_netloc_to_hostname(uri_parts)\r\n        quoted_schema = uri_parts.path[1:]\r\n        self.schema = unquote(quoted_schema) if quoted_schema else quoted_schema\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nnot need test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-12T06:04:31Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T05:20:07Z","closed_at":"2020-02-23T05:20:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7d86ae6c9cda54fa246019a5c6b458e2cd633a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

takes up about 25% of the time that the DAG parsing process spends, so replacing this one query should help speed up the rate at which the scheduler can queue tasks.\r\n\r\n  See https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/extensions/baked.html for more info. The docs explain a lot of how/why this works, so rather than rebuilding them from string 10s of times (once per task per active dag run) we cache the build SQL string!\r\n\r\n  I will collect up-to-date performance numbers against master, but this makes the \"dag parsing\" process of the scheduler (which creates and updates dag runs, and creates Task Instances) about 2x quicker:\r\n\r\n  Concurrent DagRuns | Tasks | Before | After | Speedup\r\n  -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n  2 | 12 | 0.146s (±0.0163s) | 0.074s (±0.0037s) | x1.97\r\n  10 | 12 | 1.11s (±0.0171s) | 0.266s (±0.0229s) | x4.17\r\n  40 | 12 | 4.28s (±0.101s) | 0.852s (±0.0113s) | x5.02\r\n  40 | 40 | 6.72s (±0.067s) | 2.659s (±0.0283s) | x2.53\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] No new tests, no change in behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-11T20:07:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T07:31:31Z","closed_at":"2020-04-30T07:31:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8689279999a7a5eada3930f35af9ebaf53fb107c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

of the limitations with the current implementation of DAG serialization is that Templated fields still need access to DAG Files.\r\n\r\nPotential solution 1: Store rendered version in the DB somewhere.\r\nLimitation: Tasks that are not yet run won't be able to render the templated fields (this is a useful debugging aid, especially for those without CLI access to run `airflow tasks render`) .\r\n\r\nPotential solution 2: Store both rendered & unrendered version in the DB somewhere. This will allow getting past the Limitation in Solution (1). We should store only the current unrendered version and store the last X number of rendered versions. This will also have an advantage that old task would have the rendered version that was correct at that time (which is not possible currently).\r\nLimitation/Issue: Maintaining two separate tables without much benefit\r\n\r\nPotential solution 3: Store rendered version in TI table and unrendered version in a separate column in DAG serialization table. This means that each TI would have an associated rendered field without creating an extra table and duplicating dag_id, task_id & execution_date. Once we start storing different version of serialized DAGs we can have each DAG row have it's unrendered version.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-5944](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5944)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6226\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSometime we use warning.catch_warnings in our code directly.\r\n\r\nAs explained in https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2013/06/26/testing-python-warnings/ warnings are cached in \"_warningregistry_\" and if warning is emitted, it is not emited for the second time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore warning.catch_warnings should never be used directly in our test code.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6222\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\ncurrently it doesn't log response text in the case of a GET or HEAD request\r\nit should, because response.text is a property on the Response object and is helpful for debugging!\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6223\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6220\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-10T17:23:38Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T07:01:02Z","closed_at":"2019-12-13T12:52:02Z","merged_at":"2019-12-13T12:52:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"070026b9d70a177a5ed0c442d2c4679720247b9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6208) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTasks running with the python operator using subprocess.run fail when stdout is redirected to sys.stdout as the StreamLogWriter class does not implement the file descriptor return function fileno()\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nimport subprocess\r\nsubprocess.run(\"echo 1\", shell=True, check=True,

following unit tests:\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\ntest_fileno in file tests/utils/test_logging_mixin.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

PR target\r\n\r\nThis PR targets a 1.10.x release for this bug fix\r\n- should it target the `1.10.test` branch instead of `master`?\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-5889]\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5889\r\n\r\n### Possible conflicts\r\n- This will conflict with https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6764\r\n  - one or the other will need to be rebased and since this one fixes bugs that should get into a 1.x release, I'd prefer this one to get a review/merge cycle\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- errors in polling for job status should not fail\r\n  the airflow task when the polling hits an API throttle\r\n  limit; polling should detect those cases and retry a\r\n  few times to get the job status\r\n- added typing for the BatchProtocol method return\r\n  types, based on the botocore.client.Batch types\r\n- applied trivial format consistency using black, i.e.\r\n  $ black -t py36 -l 96 {files}\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR passes existing tests\r\n  - added more unit tests to improve the code coverage\r\n  - refactored some private methods to aid unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Not applicable to this bug fix but some pydocs are enhanced by this PR\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-09T22:17:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T17:56:22Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T11:30:43Z","merged_at":"2019-12-12T11:30:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"479ee639219b1f3454b98c14811dfcdf7c4b4693","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFixed calculation of queued_dttm - was using the first/previous value from prior attempts, and not updating when tasks are re-queued or retried for some other reason. This is unexpected behavior, and although it was implemented specifically in that way it is not referenced elsewhere in the application so it seems this behavior is actually not needed. (queued_dttm is only referenced in the UI under Task Instance details - but even then it was not being displayed at all anyway due to below bug). Changed it to always be updated when a task is queued / re-queued which is more intuitive.\r\n\r\nFixed various fields not displaying correctly on the UI for \"Task Instance Details\". \r\nBefore (just displays None instead of value from DB):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26625123/70418365-e429f800-1a6b-11ea-8691-314f989a1cf1.png)\r\n\r\nAfter (displays value from DB):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26625123/70418299-d6747280-1a6b-11ea-8ff4-270ecbb0e8f6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested manually by looking at the UI and comparing to the DB backend\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-09T08:15:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T00:28:35Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T10:25:19Z","merged_at":"2019-12-11T10:25:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4a8afb5aef5b00f7c52c7ff1cc4088c8a00f4a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-6185\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n   - Create a new alembic revision to increase `Connection.password` to 5000, syncing with the SQLAlchemy model, and set `render_as_batch=True` for both online & offline migrations to work with `SQLite` backend.\r\n   - Import `SerializedDagModel` to `migrations/env.py`. As `SerializedDagModel` was removed from `models` (#6601 ), alembic thinks that the object was removed, and will try to remove the table in autogenerated schema migration. This can avoid the behavior\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-08T21:23:52Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T08:54:10Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T08:54:10Z","merged_at":"2019-12-09T08:54:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"e04059d88387117d85423dbfb258bbaa90220dcb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/71314c6aab9ea7bda5ad4b0fe222ca8a3156d0f2","head":{"label":"xinbinhuang:AIRFLOW-6185","ref":"AIRFLOW-6185","sha":"71314c6aab9ea7bda5ad4b0fe222ca8a3156d0f2","user":{"login":"xinbinhuang","id":27927454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI3NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27927454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":226176953,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjYxNzY5NTM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"xinbinhuang/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinbinhuang","id":27927454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI3NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27927454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6329\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is an experimental work. The PR proposes an Airflow-native executor bases on AMQ / PubSub (future) protocol. As an interface to the queue I used Kombu which is also a base for Celery. \r\n\r\nThe main idea is to have an executor that publishes tasks to a queue and a consumer (Worker) that reads and execute them. The information about tasks state is propagated back to scheduler through our Airflow database.\r\n\r\nEach `Worker` consist of few `TaskWorkers` and their number is defined by worker concurrency. The main purpose of the `Worker` is to keep `TaskWorkers` alive and handle graceful exit.  Each `TaskWorker` runs a single `TaskConsumer` that is a Kombu consumer that executes tasks by calling `airflow task run`.\r\n\r\n![AirflowWorker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9528307/70388418-d3b54700-19b1-11ea-9e69-5196efeb78fc.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this proposition is to create a scalable and cloud native way to run Airflow. Of course CeleryExecutor seems to be doing this already but... we are using only a few percents of what Celery can do. Moreover, I believe that our custom implementation can bring more control.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6167\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nHive query will fail if column name contains keyword, unless escaped.\r\nFix is always escaping column name when creating table.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n@KevinYang21

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6181\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTogether with guys from [Databand](https://databand.ai/) we created a new executor that is meant to be used mainly for debugging and DAG development purposes. This executor executes single task instance at time and is able to work with SQLite and sensors. \r\n\r\nUsing this executor you can debug your DAGs from IDE 🚀\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-05 at 18 42 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9528307/70260382-6f676d00-1790-11ea-9c5a-44d42cabbb02.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-05 at 18 54 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9528307/70260493-b35a7200-1790-11ea-8eba-13a8dc0fac4d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-05T17:54:53Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T21:44:37Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T21:44:37Z","merged_at":"2019-12-12T21:44:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe2334fb0acbf1cfd5a8fb6986d1a573855f800a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6175\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is a bug caused by scheduler_jobs refactor which leads to task failure and scheduler locking.\r\n\r\nEssentially when a there is an overflow of tasks going into the scheduler, the tasks are set back to scheduled, but are not removed from the executor's queued_tasks queue.\r\n\r\nThis means that the executor will attempt to run tasks that are in the scheduled state, but those tasks will fail dependency checks. Eventually the queue is filled with scheduled tasks, and the scheduler can no longer run.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-05T00:00:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T11:17:31Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T11:17:31Z","merged_at":"2019-12-10T11:17:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3bb4c31b866b15a9a87f269073f32fb5374c8e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6172\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate
