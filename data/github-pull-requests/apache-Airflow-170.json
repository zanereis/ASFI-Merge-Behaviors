current `restrict-start_date` does not catch defining `start_date` in `default_args` of example DAGs like `default_args=dict(start_date=dates.days_ago(1))` as seen in the Google provider.\r\n\r\nThis

is an ongoing effort to enhance example DAGs by setting static values for `start_date`, ensuring `catchup=False` is set, cleaning up and/or implementing useful `default_args`, and removing/limiting the use of redundant, default connection ID values.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly addresses the static `start_date` and `catchup` clean up areas in example DAGs in the across non-Google Cloud providers (e.g. Ads, Firebase, LevelDB, Marketing Platform, and Suite). \r\n\r\nThe following additional (small) updates are also included:\r\n-  The `example_campaign_manager` example DAG was updated to take advantage of `XComArgs` rather than the classic Jinja templating to pull `XComs`.\r\n- Updated task-dependency notation in `example_firestore` to improve readability using `chain()`.\r\n- Removed unnecessary setting of `dag=dag` in `example_leveldb`\r\n\r\n> Note: There was an opportunity to consolidate task args to `default_args` for most, if not all, DAGs. However, these updates were not implemented as they would have conflicted too much with the operator documentation that references the example DAGs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change,

`GoogleCampaignManagerDownloadReportOperator`, `GoogleDisplayVideo360DownloadReportOperator`, and `GoogleSearchAdsDownloadReportOperator` perform a string validation on the `bucket_name` arg in their constructor. This arg is a templated field which means the input could be an `XComArg`. Unfortunately, this string validation fails with `AttributeError: 'XComArg' object has no attribute 'startswith'` when the input arg for `bucket_name` is an `XComArg`.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that, if desired, the `bucket_name` arg can be successfully passed to these operators as an `XComArg`.\r\n\r\nAlso included in this PR is some DRY refactoring of the operator unit tests to use some global variables across tests.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

The first part was straightforward and very helpful. The [pipeline example](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial.html#pipeline-example), however, felt like it was missing some crucial pieces of information. I then found this file in the repo that seems to be a more up-to-date version of what was on the website and helped me get it working.\r\n\r\n## Request\r\nCan the website be updated to include these new changes and maybe even have some additional clarifying context? For example, it would be nice to clarify that this can be created in a new Postgres database as long as the corresponding connection is added in the admin connections.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

adds support for including or excluding a task execution during a DAG run based on a filtering mechanism that matches on the execution date.\r\n\r\nThe changeset adds two optional parameters `include_date` and `exclude_date` to the base operator class – along with a new method `include_in_dagrun(execution_date)` which determines whether or not to _schedule_ a task instance or immediately mark it as _skipped_.\r\n\r\nThe time filters are instances of classes under `airflow.timefilters` and can be combined using the bitwise and/or operators.\r\n\r\nCurrently implemented time filters:\r\n\r\n- `airflow.timefilters.cron.CronTimeFilter` – matches on a cron expression\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\nAt this time, only built-in time filters (and combinations) are possible. This is not a design limitation as such, but an implementation decision. It would be possible to provide a registration mechanism similar to time tables to allow using custom classes.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n1. Why not just use `BranchOperator` – ?\r\n\r\n    Executing a task simply to evaluate on DAG metadata (i.e., execution date) is wasteful, similar to how we don't need to \"execute\" a `DummyOperator` in the common case.\r\n\r\n    Filtering on a declarative basis makes it possible to provide a better user experience as well, helping to make it clear when a particular task will be skipped (e.g.

a DAG has been running for a bit, it often occurs in our workflow that a task is added.\r\nOften, people want to run these tasks for historical dates.\r\nHowever, when there are more TaskInstances you want to run than the `max_active_runs` DagRuns, you might cross the limit.\r\nTherefore, I felt we should add the option to mark the DagRun immediately as Queued.\r\n\r\nFor now, the work around I did was mark the tasks I wanted to run as success first, then clear them. \r\nThis yields the same result but requires more click, and Airflow is of course all about efficiency :)\r\n\r\nLove to hear some feedback on what you think about what I've done with the refactoring. In particulair:\r\n- Added the typing information to all args/kwargs\r\n- Instead of providing session with None, we use the asterix (*) to indicate it's a keyword and give it correct typing info.\r\n- Instead of repeating ourselves, I extracted a function that we can use for Queued and Running DagRun state changes.

PR proposes to add mouse mode on for the tmux session used within breeze (the session you are dropped into by `./breeze start-airflow` for example).\r\n\r\nMouse mode allows users to move between panes by clicking with their mouse and they can also scroll back through terminal log history with their mouse wheel.\r\n\r\nThis option could be set by each user by using tmux config file, but mouse mode is a very intuitive user experience, especially for those that are not familiar with tmux, and it's harmless (to my knowledge) to enable. So it seems reasonable to enable it by default within the `run_tmux` script.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

#19071\r\n\r\nThe `command` parameter in the `SSHOperator` is listed as a `template_field` which means users could pass in an arg for this parameter as an output from a TaskFlow function via `XComArgs`. However, the current constructor of the operator performs a string validation on the `command` arg to set another parameter, `get_pty`. This parameter is force to True if the `command` starts with \"sudo\". If the arg is passed in as an `XComArg` the DAG fails to parse with an `AttributeError: 'XComArg' object has no attribute 'startswith'`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the `command` is passed as part of a Jinja template expression but the string does not explicitly begin with \"sudo\", `get_pty` will be set to an incorrect value.  For example in the below DAG, the `get_pty` parameter will be set to False even though the rendered `command` value will begin with \"sudo\":\r\n```python\r\ndef generate_sudo_command():\r\n    return \"sudo command\"\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(\r\n    schedule_interval=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2021, 10, 29),\r\n    tags=['example'],\r\n    user_defined_macros={\"generate_sudo_command\": generate_sudo_command},\r\n)\r\ndef example_dag_decorator_ssh():\r\n    run = SSHOperator(task_id='run_my_command', command=\"{{ generate_sudo_command() }}\")\r\n\r\n\r\ndag = example_dag_decorator_ssh()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the string validation to the `execute()` method of the operator such that the `XComArg` and templated value can be rendered prior to setting the `get_pty` attribute of the operator.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

distinguish between different objects.\r\n- Full import paths for classes are shown to easily identify the class. In particular, I want the executor field to show the full name so that it can be easily set in the configuration file.\r\n- The method output is deterministic, so it's easier to use.

the FAB security manager code by doing the following.\r\n1. Modifies permission lookup by accessing `User.perms` property method and checking if a permission pair is included in the user's list of perms.\r\n2. Extends `AnonymousUserMixin` to create `AnonymousUser`, which has both `perms` and `roles` property methods. Removes the need for custom auth logic for anonymous users.\r\n3. Removes helper methods that provide little value, including:\r\n * `.get_readable_dags()`\r\n * `.current_user_has_permissions()`\r\n * `._has_resource_access()`\r\n * `.user_has_perms()`\r\n * `.user_has_roles()`\r\n4. Removes unused methods:\r\n * `SecurityManager.is_item_public()`\r\n5. Moves the code to create a root dag resource name to `Permissions.resource_name_for_dag()`\r\n\r\nThis is the next piece of the permissions refactor.","created_at":"2021-10-28T21:06:49Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T18:10:42Z","closed_at":"2022-02-04T17:09:52Z","merged_at":"2022-02-04T17:09:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e9828022b03b60d9e112f1f64340a528c8407e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{

is a solution for https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19096\r\n\r\nPreviously, the serialization of params did not run the param value through the `_serialize` function, resulting in non-json-serializable dictionaries.  This manifested when a user, for example, tried to use params with a default value of type `set`.\r\n\r\nHere we change the logic to run the param value through the serialization process.  And I add a test for the `set` case.\r\n\r\nCould def use extra set of eyes on schema definition. btw i added hook for formatting this -- i can do that in separate pr if that's helpful.","created_at":"2021-10-27T23:59:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T21:47:22Z","closed_at":"2021-11-05T17:19:51Z","merged_at":"2021-11-05T17:19:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"8512e0507263495ddd326e27699c45cafd31a5e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769805151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5ODA1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:serialization","name":"area:serialization","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:
