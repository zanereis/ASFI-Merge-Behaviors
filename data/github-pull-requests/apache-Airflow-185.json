executor is currently adopting anything that has ever run before and has been cleared since then.\r\n\r\n**Example of the issue:**\r\nWe have a DAG that runs over 150 sensor tasks and 50 ETL tasks while having a concurrency of 3 and max_active_runs of 16. This setup is required because we want to divide the resources and we don't want this DAG to take up all the resources. What will happen is that many tasks will be in scheduled for a bit as it can't queue them due to the concurrency of 3. However, because of the current implementations, if these tasks ever run before, they would get adopted by the schedulers executor instance and become stuck forever [without this PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16550). However, they should have never been adopted in the first place.\r\n\r\n**Contents of the PR**:\r\n1. Tasks that are in scheduled should never have arrived at an executor. Hence, we remove the task state scheduled from the option to be adopted.\r\n2. Given this task instance `external_executor_id`  is quite important in deciding whether it is adopted, we will also reset this when we reset the state of the TaskInstance.","created_at":"2021-06-29T18:58:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T10:37:47Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T22:02:02Z","merged_at":"2021-07-02T22:02:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"554a23928efb4ff1d87d115ae2664edec3a9408c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

@darwinyip \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a parameter reattach_prev_task to ECSOperator.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nUntil now we could use 'reattach' which was reattaching a running ECS Task (if there was one running) of the same 'family' instead of creating a new one. The problem was that if we had workflows using the same ECS Task Definition in several tasks, it didn't know which one to reattach and we could only use `concurrency=1` in some pipelines for example (when we launch the same ECS task in parallel from Airflow with different configurations).\r\n\r\n**Now:**\r\nNow with reattach_prev_task instead, when we launch a new ECS task, it will store temporarily the ECS Task ARN in XCOM. If there is an issue during the run (typically connection problem between Airflow and ECS for long-running tasks or Airflow worker restarting which was then still running those tasks in the background without Airflow being aware of it):\r\n- self._start_task will store the ECS task ARN in XCOM (in a 'fake' task_id equal to f\"{self.task_id}_task_arn\"\r\n- in the next execution, it will check if this task ARN is still running and if so it will reattach it to the operator, otherwise it will create a new one\r\n- when the operator runs succesfully it will delete the XCOM value\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't change the logic of 'reattach' to do that directly because I didn't know if it had been designed for other use cases\r\n\r\n**Update 2021-07-01:**\r\nAfter discussing with @darwinyip  I made the change to 'reattach' directly instead of creating a new

#16680\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that when a user clears a running task, the task does not fail. Instead it is killed and retried gracefully.\r\n\r\nThis is done by introducing a new State called `RESTARTING`. As the name suggests, a `TaskInstance` is set to this state when it's cleared while running.

permissions for modifying Task Instances or modifying Dag Runs as of today require `dag_read` permissions on the DAG and the corresponding action permission.\r\nA full overview is shown [at the Access Control page of Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/access-control.html#dag-level-permissions)\r\n\r\nIt feels to me as in that case the whole `dag_edit` base_permission is undervalued in this case and the `dag_view` base_permission gives too much actual permissions.\r\n\r\nImagine the following setup:\r\n- Everyone is able to see each others DAGs\r\n- Some people should be able to modify their own DAGs\r\n- They should not be able to modify their neighbours DAGs\r\n\r\nThis setup is currently not supported.\r\nAs a work around, on my work setup I currently implemented a SQLAlchemy listener to block update operations on  TaskInstances where a user doesn't have `can_edit` privilege on this specific DAG.\r\nTherefore this PR changes the following items(copied from the link above) to require `DAGS.can_edit` where it currently says `DAGS.can_read` privileges.\r\n\r\n**Currently:**\r\nAction | Permissions | Minimum Role\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nClear DAG | DAGs.can_read, Task Instances.can_delete | User\r\nClear DAG Run | DAGs.can_read, Task Instances.can_delete | User\r\nMark DAG as blocked | Dags.can_read, DAG Runs.can_read | User\r\nMark DAG Run as failed | Dags.can_read, DAG Runs.can_edit | User\r\nMark DAG Run as success | Dags.can_read, DAG Runs.can_edit | User\r\nClear Task Instance | DAGs.can_read, DAG Runs.can_read, Task Instances.can_edit | User\r\nTriggers Task Instance | DAGs.can_read, Task Instances.can_create | User\r\nMark Task as failed | DAGs.can_read, Task Instances.can_edit | User\r\nMark Task as success | DAGs.can_read, Task Instances.can_edit | User\r\n\r\n**Updated:**\r\nAction | Permissions | Minimum Role\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nClear DAG | DAGs.can_edit, Task Instances.can_delete | User\r\nClear DAG Run | DAGs.can_edit, Task Instances.can_delete | User\r\nMark DAG as blocked | Dags.can_edit, DAG Runs.can_read | User\r\nMark DAG Run as failed | Dags.can_edit, DAG Runs.can_edit | User\r\nMark DAG Run as success | Dags.can_edit, DAG Runs.can_edit | User\r\nClear Task Instance | DAGs.can_edit, Task Instances.can_edit | User\r\nTriggers Task Instance | DAGs.can_edit, Task Instances.can_create | User\r\nMark Task as failed | DAGs.can_edit, Task Instances.can_edit | User\r\nMark Task as success | DAGs.can_edit, Task Instances.can_edit | User\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is interest in merging this PR, I will also make a corresponding PR on the docs side to update the page.","created_at":"2021-06-24T15:13:26Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T05:36:49Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T21:04:38Z","merged_at":"2021-09-21T21:04:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"f74d0ab38e00b83b49e20d410736e2a8c42de095","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jhtimmins","id":4926004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhtimmins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"pub

classes extending the BaseOperators that implement their own `get_serialized_fields()` method, can't list any complex types (only primitive types are supported).\r\nIf you try to add a complex type, it will fail on the _deserialize() step with a KeyError.\r\nThe current serialisation is amazing and supports many complex types, so it would be a shame to not make this available to classes extending the BaseOperator or DAG classes.\r\n\r\nThe error is due to the optimisations that are added upon on the BaseOperator and the DAG that tries to store all fields in the smallest form possible. \r\nHowever, if we don't know the type beforehand, which we don't in the cases of extra fields in classes extending the BaseOperator/DAG, we shouldn't optimise these fields.\r\n\r\n**This PR does the following:**\r\n- Add serialization support for complex types to any fields listed in classes extending upon the BaseOperator.\r\n- The same for any class extending upon the DAG class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example of the current problem with a custom operator:**\r\n```python\r\nclass MyOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    __serialized_fields: Optional[frozenset] = None\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, a_dictionary_value: Dict, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\r\n        self.a_dictionary_value = a_dictionary_value\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_serialized_fields(cls):\r\n        if not cls.__serialized_fields:\r\n            custom_fields = {\"a_dictionary_value\"}\r\n            cls.__serialized_fields = frozenset(super().get_serialized_fields() | custom_fields)\r\n        return cls.__serialized_fields\r\n```\r\nWithout this PR the deserialisation of this MyOperator class would fail with the following error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/jorrick/.venv/airflow_dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 2446, in wsgi_app\r\n    response =

improvements to DataSync operator. \r\n\r\nMost notable is the ability of the operator to cancel an in progress task execution, eg if the Airflow task times out or is killed. This avoids a zombie issue when the AWS DataSync service can have a zombie task running even if Airflow's task has failed. \r\n\r\nAlso made some small changes to polling values. DataSync is a batch-based uploading service, it takes several minutes to operate so I changed the polling intervals from 5 seconds to 30 seconds and adjusted max_iterations to what I think is a more reasonable default.\r\n\r\ncloses:

as https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16494 - However that PR had to be reverted in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16518 as it failed building of PROD image, this PR/commit will fix it.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM: Currently the airflow wheel and tar.gz is built with the yarn.lock which is not actually used by the airflow itself. Having this file in the docker image causes the clair and trivy scanners to fail.\r\n\r\nFIX: The fix is to exclude the yarn.lock by specifying it in the manifest.in to exclude from both tar.gz and wheel -- source and binary distributions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
