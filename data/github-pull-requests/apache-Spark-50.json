for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImprove executor exit error message on YARN, with additional explanation of exit code defined by Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark defines its own exit codes, which have overlap with exit codes defined by YARN, thus diagnostics reported by YARN may be misleading. For example, exit code 56 is defined as `HEARTBEAT_FAILURE` in Spark, but `INVALID_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` in Hadoop, thus the error message displayed in UI is misleading.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"714\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/26535726/b8cf7834-2958-467f-8851-e47ad0f61833\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the UI displays more information when the executor runs on YARN exits without zero code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause HEARTBEAT_FAILURE depends on the network and Driver's load, to simplify the test, I just use `select java_method('java.lang.System', 'exit', 56)` to simulate the above case.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"690\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd config `spark.broadcast.cleanAfterExecution.enabled`(default false) . Clean up the broadcast data generated when sql execution ends ( only suitable for long running Spark SQL services ). \r\nBefore this PR: broadcast data cleaning can only rely on when GC is triggered, which may lead to a lot of waste of memory usage , and may also cause query instability if a single GC takes too long.\r\nAfter this PR: after the execution of sql is completed, the broadcast data generated during the execution of the sql will be cleared.\r\n\r\nNote: this parameter is only suitable for long running Spark SQL services. If this parameter is turned on and one dataframe is collected twice, the broadcast data will not be found during the second execution (because it has been cleaned).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Reduce memory load on driver and executor. This can make a long running spark service more stable. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd config `spark.broadcast.cleanAfterExecution.enabled`.\r\nDefault `false`,  If `true`, the broadcast data generated by the sql will be destroyed when it is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd config `spark.broadcast.cleanAfterExecution.enabled`(default false) . Clean up the broadcast data generated when sql execution ends ( only suitable for long running Spark SQL services ). \r\nBefore this PR: broadcast data cleaning can only rely on when GC is triggered, which may lead to a lot of waste of memory usage , and may also cause query instability if a single GC takes too long.\r\nAfter this PR: after the execution of sql is completed, the broadcast data generated during the execution of the sql will be cleared.\r\n\r\nNote: this parameter is only suitable for long running Spark SQL services. If this parameter is turned on and one dataframe is collected twice, the broadcast data will not be found during the second execution (because it has been cleaned).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Reduce memory load on driver and executor. This can make a long running spark service more stable. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd config `spark.broadcast.cleanAfterExecution.enabled`.\r\nDefault `false`,  If `true`, the broadcast data generated by the sql will be destroyed when it is completed.","created_at":"2024-01-30T06:58:52Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T07:21:29Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T07:21:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7a7c750719ffa2aab7b5343657dd788448f1db5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44947/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44947/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44947/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f543cc3f41998fd6c2938c80da6c4be7d851d9b","head":{"label":"yabola:function","ref":"function","sha":"8f543cc3f41998fd6c2938c80da6c4be7d851d9b","user":{"login":"yabola","id":31469905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDY5OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31469905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola","html_url":"https://github.com/yabola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":750190560,"node_id":"R_kgDOLLb_4A","name":"spark","full_name":"yabola/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yabola","id":31469905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDY5OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31469905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola","html_url":"https://github.com/yabola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yabola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yabola/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to:\r\n- simplify `UnaryMinus` & `Abs`\r\n- convert error-class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2043` to `ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW`, and remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.When the data type in `UnaryMinus` and `Abs` is `ByteType` or `ShortType`, if `an overflow exception` occurs, the corresponding error class is: `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2043`\r\nBut when the data type is `IntegerType` or `LongType`, if `an overflow exception` occurs, its corresponding error class is: ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW, We should unify it.\r\n\r\n2.In the `codegen` logic of `UnaryMinus` and `Abs`, there is a difference between the logic of generating code when the data type is `ByteType` or `ShortType` and when the data type is `IntegerType` or `LongType`. We can unify it and simplify the code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Update existed UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a CSV parsing bug with existence default values and column pruning (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46890).\r\n\r\nThe bug fix includes disabling column pruning specifically when checking the CSV header schema against the required schema expected by Catalyst. This makes the expected schema match what the CSV parser provides, since later we also happen instruct the CSV parser to disable column pruning and instead read each entire row in order to correctly assign the default value(s) during execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this change, queries from a subset of the columns in a CSV table whose `CREATE TABLE` statement contained default values would return an internal exception. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (\r\n  product_id INT,\r\n  name STRING,\r\n  price FLOAT default 0.0,\r\n  quantity INT default 0\r\n)\r\nUSING CSV\r\nOPTIONS (\r\n  header 'true',\r\n  inferSchema 'false',\r\n  enforceSchema 'false',\r\n  path '/Users/maximgekk/tmp/products.csv'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CSV file products.csv:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproduct_id,name,price,quantity\r\n1,Apple,0.50,100\r\n2,Banana,0.25,200\r\n3,Orange,0.75,50\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT price FROM products;\r\n24/01/28 11:43:09 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 8.0 (TID 6)\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Number of column in CSV header is not equal to number of fields in the schema:\r\n Header length: 4, schema size: 1\r\nCSV file: file:///Users/Daniel.Tenedorio/tmp/products.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace all `UnsupportedOperationException` by `SparkUnsupportedOperationException` in `sql` code base, and introduce new legacy error classes with the `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` prefix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify Spark SQL exception, and port Java exceptions on Spark exceptions with error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code assumes some particular format of `UnsupportedOperationException` messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-29T18:42:55Z","updated_at":"2024-02-04T05:32:51Z","closed_at":"2024-02-03T08:22:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7aaeb897a422872ae03b53670ad57a4a05cbe09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44876 to refactor the code and make it cleaner. The idea is to add a dedicated class for column definition instead of `StructField` in Create/ReplaceTable command. This is more flexible and cleaner than adding an additional default column expression in `CreateTable` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCode refactor, and makes it easier to fully eliminate the need of a fake analyzer for default value handling in the future. We should make similar code changes to ALTER TABLE command and v1 CREATE TABLE command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR prevents malicious users from injecting inline scripts via job and stage descriptions.\r\n\r\nSpark's Web UI [already checks the security of job and stage descriptions](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a368280708dd3c6eb90bd3b09a36a68bdd096222/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/UIUtils.scala#L528-L545) before rendering them as HTML (or treating them as plain text). The UI already disallows `<script>` tags but doesn't protect against attributes with inline scripts like `onclick` or `onmouseover`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOn multi-user clusters, bad users can inject scripts into their job and stage descriptions. The UI already finds that [worth protecting against](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a368280708dd3c6eb90bd3b09a36a68bdd096222/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/UIUtils.scala#L533-L535). So this is extending that protection to scripts in attributes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes if users relied on inline scripts or attributes in their job or stage descriptions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-29T09:25:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T06:44:41Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T06:43:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b1d1a78702c9ffa8097a51ae0f3c76ac08d5343","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `grpcio*` from 1.59.3 to [1.62.0](https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.62.0/)and `grpc-java` from 1.59.0 to 1.62.2 for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\ngrpc 1.60.0 start to support dualstack IPv4 and IPv6 backend support:\r\n\r\n- Implemented dualstack IPv4 and IPv6 backend support, as per draft gRFC A61. xDS support currently guarded by GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_XDS_DUALSTACK_ENDPOINTS env var.\r\n\r\nNote that in `grpc-java` 1.61.0, since the dependency scope of `grpc-protobuf` on `grpc-protobuf-lite` has been changed from `compile` to `runtime`, we need to manually configure the dependency of the `connect` module on `grpc-protobuf-lite` and explicitly exclude the dependency on `protobuf-javalite` because `SparkConnectService` uses `io.grpc.protobuf.lite.ProtoLiteUtils` \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10756/files\r\n\r\nThe relevant release notes are as

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently user will get a misleading error as org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateSchemaNotCompatible if restarting query in the same checkpoint location and changing their stateful operator. This PR catches such errors and throws a new error with informative message.\r\n\r\nAfter physical planning, before execution phase, we will read from state metadata with the current operator id to fetch operator name of committed batch with the same operator id. If operator name does not match, throws the error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current error message is misleading to users. We should provide users with message that can guide them to the real root cause of error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `POST` APIs from `MasterWebUI` when `spark.ui.killEnabled` is false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf `spark.ui.killEnabled` is false, we don't need to attach `POST`-related redirect or servlet handlers from the beginning because it will be ignored in `MasterPage`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8cd0d1854da04334aff3188e4eca08a48f734579/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/ui/MasterPage.scala#L64-L65\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously, the user request is ignored silently after redirecting. Now, it will response with a correct HTTP error code, 405 `Method Not Allowed`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test suite, `ReadOnlyMasterWebUISuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-29T04:55:14Z","updated_at":"2024-02-03T08:04:21Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T06:38:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6088a3c2af2e88fd13072170281c46734d3d8a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove PySpark error conditions into a standalone JSON file.\r\n\r\nAdjust the instructions in `MANIFEST.in` so they package the new JSON file correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHaving the JSON in its own file enables better IDE support for editing and managing the JSON. For example, VS Code will detect duplicate keys automatically and underline them.\r\n\r\nThis change also simplifies the logic to regenerate the JSON.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Existing unit tests.\r\n2. I confirmed that rewriting the JSON file works as intended:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.errors.exceptions import _write_self\r\n    _write_self()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. I built a PySpark distribution, installed it, and confirmed the error class test still works.\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    trash dist/\r\n    ./dev/make-distribution.sh --pip -DskipTests -Phive\r\n\r\n    # The JSON file is put in the dist/ directory.\r\n    find dist -name 'error-conditions.json'\r\n    # dist/python/pyspark/errors/error-conditions.json\r\n\r\n    # It's also listed in SOURCES.txt.\r\n    grep error-conditions.json dist/python/pyspark.egg-info/SOURCES.txt \r\n    # pyspark/errors/error-conditions.json\r\n\r\n    cd dist/python\r\n    python -m venv venv\r\n    source venv/bin/activate\r\n    pip install .\r\n\r\n    # It also gets installed into the newly created venv.\r\n    find venv -name error-conditions.json\r\n    # venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyspark/errors/error-conditions.json\r\n\r\n    # Running the test from inside the venv also succeeds.\r\n    python pyspark/errors/tests/test_errors.py\r\n    # Ran 3 tests in 0.000s\r\n    # \r\n    # OK\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. I repeated test 3, but this time used the generated ZIP to install PySpark in a fresh virtual environment:\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ cd .../spark/\r\n    $ trash dist\r\n    $ ./dev/make-distribution.sh --pip -DskipTests -Phive\r\n    $ cd .../Desktop/\r\n    $ python -m venv venv\r\n    $ source venv/bin/activate\r\n    $ pip install .../spark/python/dist/pyspark-4.0.0.dev0.tar.gz\r\n    $ find venv -name error-conditions.json\r\n    venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyspark/errors/error-conditions.json\r\n    $ python\r\n    Python 3.11.7 (main, Dec 11 2023, 02:35:11) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)] on darwin\r\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n    >>> from pyspark.errors.error_classes import ERROR_CLASSES_MAP\r\n    >>> len(ERROR_CLASSES_MAP)\r\n    222\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    You can see that the JSON file was packaged correctly and installed into the virtual environment, and `ERROR_CLASSES_MAP` loaded correctly as well.\r\n\r\n5. I installed PySpark by including a different built ZIP in the `PYTHONPATH` as [described here][pyzip]:\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ cd .../spark/\r\n    $ trash dist\r\n    $ ./dev/make-distribution.sh --pip -DskipTests -Phive\r\n    $ cd .../Desktop/\r\n    $ export SPARK_HOME=\".../spark\"\r\n    $ export PYTHONPATH=$(ZIPS=(\"$SPARK_HOME\"/python/lib/*.zip); IFS=:; echo \"${ZIPS[*]}\"):$PYTHONPATH\r\n    $ python\r\n    Python 3.11.7 (main, Dec 11 2023, 02:35:11) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)] on darwin\r\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n    >>> from pyspark.errors.error_classes import ERROR_CLASSES_MAP\r\n    >>> len(ERROR_CLASSES_MAP)\r\n    222\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n[pyzip]: https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.1/api/python/getting_started/install.html#manually-downloading\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to invoke `CSVOptons.isColumnPruningEnabled` introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44872 while matching of CSV header to a schema in the V1 CSV datasource.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the failure when column pruning happens and a schema is not enforced:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.\r\n     | option(\"multiLine\", true).\r\n     | option(\"header\", true).\r\n     | option(\"escape\", \"\\\"\").\r\n     | option(\"enforceSchema\", false).\r\n     | csv(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/es-939111-data.csv\").\r\n     | count()\r\n24/01/27 12:43:14 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 3)\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Number of column in CSV header is not equal to number of fields in the schema:\r\n Header length: 4, schema size: 0\r\nCSV file: file:///Users/maximgekk/tmp/es-939111-data.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CSVv1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CSVv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CSVLegacyTimeParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *.CsvFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-27T09:39:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T16:43:38Z","closed_at":"2024-01-27T16:22:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5ef241b229f889533377fa6edb76a6d8781ac33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7436f4f86a89f1b6881a158fab677970f9cbf0f4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:check-header-column-pruning","ref":"check-header-column-pruning","sha":"7436f4f86a89f1b6881a158fab677970f9cbf0f4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new optional property to the ExecutePlanRequest object in the Connect gRPC API to allow callers to set the job description from the client app. This would allow callers to set the description to the actual stack trace of the calling application (for example).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA slight improvement to callers using the Connect API when viewing jobs in the Spark UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, callers can control what is shown in the Spark UI. The default is the current behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually so far, if there is interest in this then I will try and work out (happy to take any advice here!) on how to write tests for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-27T08:09:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T00:16:04Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T00:16:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd38bb57a01a0be066886bb807b30aabba788cb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6896be400cf61d21548a09295f14a30f96b97907","head":{"label":"GoEddie:spark-connect-job-description","ref":"spark-connect-job-description","sha":"6896be400cf61d21548a09295f14a30f96b97907","user":{"login":"GoEddie","id":4895930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTU5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4895930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie","html_url":"https://github.com/GoEddie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":748588722,"node_id":"R_kgDOLJ6Osg","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"GoEddie/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GoEddie","id":4895930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTU5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4895930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie","html_url":"https://github.com/GoEddie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoEddie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GoEddie/apache-spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to introduce a new configuration, `spark.deploy.workerSelectionPolicy`, in order to allow users to decide a\r\npolicy to assign executors on one of the assignable workers.\r\n- `CORES_FREE_ASC`: Choose a worker with the least free cores\r\n- `CORES_FREE_DESC`: Choose a worker with the most free cores (**default**)\r\n- `MEMORY_FREE_ASC`: Choose a worker with the least free memory\r\n- `MEMORY_FREE_DESC`: Choose a worker with the most free memory\r\n- `WORKER_ID`: Choose a worker with the smallest worker id\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is very helpful for users to manage Spark Standalone cluster dynamically based on their workload and underlying cluster management policy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. The default policy, `CORES_FREE_DESC`, follows the existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-26T23:07:29Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T03:33:56Z","closed_at":"2024-01-27T00:19:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bef81d29a9ab84f66becd6b6319a0baeebd827f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be0a9bf9ddc5fa67540815bea5b6f068fd71b958","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-46881","ref":"SPARK-46881","sha":"be0a9bf9ddc5fa67540815bea5b6f068fd71b958","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

Implemented only for RocksDBStateStoreProvider, as we do not currently support multiple column families for HDFS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis functionality is needed to so users can remove state from the state store from the StatefulProcessorHandleImpl\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes - this functionality (removing column families) was previously not supported from our RocksDB client. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR represents initial change for introducing collation concept into Spark engine. For higher level overview please take a look at the umbrella [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46830).\r\n\r\nThis PR extends both `StringType` and `PhysicalStringType` with collationId field. At this point this is just a noop field. In the following PRs this field will be used for fetching right UTF8String comparison rules from global collation table.\r\n\r\nGoal is to make sure that we keep backwards compatibility - this is ensured by keeping singleton `object StringType` that inherits `StringType(DEFAULT_COLLATION_ID)`. DEFAULT_COLLATION_ID represents UTF8 Binary collation rules (i.e. byte for byte comparison, that is already used in Spark). Hence, any code that relies on `StringType` will stay binary compatible with this version. \r\n\r\nIt may be hard to see end state from just this initial PR. For reviewers who want to see how this will fit in the end state, please take a look at this draft [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44537).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPlease refer to umbrella JIRA ticket for collation effort.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt this point No.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis initial PR doesn't introduce any surface level changes. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to provide better prompts when option's `mode` is null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the original logic, if the mode is

GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `logrotate` to Spark docker files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo help a user to easily rotate the logs by configuration. Note that this is not for rigorous users who cannot allow log data loss. `logratate` is easy but is known to allow log loss during rotation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe image size change is negligible.\r\n```\r\n$ docker images spark\r\nREPOSITORY   TAG                IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE\r\nspark        latest-logrotate

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds support for users to provide a Dataframe that can be used to instantiate state for the query in the first batch for arbitrary state API v2.\r\n\r\nNote that populating the initial state will only happen for the first batch of the new streaming query. Trying to re-initialize state for the same grouping key will result in an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed to support initial state. The changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nThis PR introduces a new function: \r\n```\r\ndef transformWithState(\r\n      statefulProcessor: StatefulProcessorWithInitialState[K, V, U, S],\r\n      timeoutMode: TimeoutMode,\r\n      outputMode: OutputMode,\r\n      initialState: KeyValueGroupedDataset[K, S]): Dataset[U] \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Remove rules for the following classes that we do not use:\r\n  - `.code` (We use `code` _elements_, but not a `code` _class_.)\r\n  - `.code-tab` (We _do_ have a `codetabs` class, however.)\r\n  - `.jumbotron` (No idea where this came from, but we don't use it.)\r\n- Remove some superfluous comments.\r\n- Using [css-purge][1], merge rules for the same selectors that were previously scattered across several blocks, and remove overridden rules.\r\n- Format the whole file with VS Code. This makes the spacing consistent, and puts each selector on its own line.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://rbtech.github.io/css-purge/\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's very difficult to make improvements to the presentation of the documentation due to the noise in this CSS file. This change will facilitate future improvements to the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it shouldn't. This change should be functionally neutral.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built the docs and manually reviewed them. Code blocks and tables look the same to me.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-25T19:16:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-26T05:03:15Z","closed_at":"2024-01-26T03:14:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be030ee4b663946deba3bfa28f397ba13890545e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6ee31d8016d29e7a2eaf759824fe999ce5d9c26","head":{"label":"nchammas:css-cleanup","ref":"css-cleanup","sha":"f6ee31d8016d29e7a2eaf759824fe999ce5d9c26","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe are allowing batch queries to use and define the `TransformWithState` operator, which was initially introduced for streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is needed to keep up the parity between streaming and batch APIs, since we want everything supported in streaming to be supported in batch, as well. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests that use the TransformWithState operator with a batch query.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n* The DAGScheduler could currently run into a deadlock with another thread if both access the partitions of the same RDD at the same time.\r\n* To make progress in getCacheLocs, we require both exclusive access to the RDD partitions and the location cache. We first lock on the location cache, and then on the RDD.\r\n* When accessing partitions of an RDD, the RDD first acquires exclusive access on the partitions, and then might acquire exclusive access on the location cache.\r\n* If thread 1 is able to acquire access on the RDD, while thread 2 holds the access to the location cache, we can run into a deadlock situation.\r\n* To fix this, acquire locks in the same order. Change the DAGScheduler to first acquire the lock on the RDD, and then the lock on the location cache.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* This is a deadlock you can run into, which can prevent any progress on the cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n* No\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n* Unit test that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`WorkerInfo` extends `Serializable` and has `WorkerResourceInfo` as data.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1f23edfa84aa3318791d5fbbbae22d479a49134a/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/WorkerInfo.scala#L49-L58\r\n\r\n`WorkerInfo` itself has no data field, but inherits `ResourceAllocator` which has data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43942 upgraded the `grpcio` version and simultaneously upgraded the `grpcio` version installed in `Install

These two steps are used to install Python linter dependencies for `branch-3.4/branch-3.5` in daily tests. They should use the same configuration as `branch-3.4/branch-3.5` for safety. So this pr reset the version of grpcio installed in these two steps:\r\n\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs [suggested here][1], this change improves the documentation build so that it builds Spark at most one time, regardless of what API docs are requested in the build.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44791#discussion_r1459233153\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is no need to build Spark multiple times when generating docs. In particular, building Scala and Python docs, or Scala and SQL docs, causes Spark to be built twice.\r\n\r\nFixing this problem saves us a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built the docs as follows on `master` as well as on this branch:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntime SKIP_RDOC=1 SKIP_PYTHONDOC=1 bundle exec jekyll build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe time results before and after this change are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbefore\r\n------\r\nreal    6m48.815s\r\nuser    23m17.943s\r\nsys     1m29.578s\r\n\r\nafter\r\n-----\r\nreal    4m10.672s\r\nuser    14m10.130s\r\nsys     1m0.773s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's a savings of about 2.5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I diffed the generated `_site/` dir across `master` and this branch and confirmed they are essentially identical except for some general SQL examples files.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove the error categories and states out of the Markdown table in the error README and into standalone JSON files.\r\n\r\nI am using the terms \"error category\" and \"error state\" as defined in SPARK-46810.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe data captured in Markdown is not automation-friendly. In future work, I intend to automate the generation of [sql-error-conditions-sqlstates.md][states] using these new JSON files.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are many instances of duplicate keys and inconsistent descriptions for the error categories, which this change resolves by moving the data into JSON. This also enables IDE support for basic validation.\r\n\r\n[states]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6ea2094da252ce96d875696dbd68c4d1bc673dc4/docs/sql-error-conditions-sqlstates.md\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe updated unit tests ensure the following:\r\n- All error categories (e.g. `42`) and states (e.g. `42K01`) have the correct length and format.\r\n- All error states have a two-character prefix that is a valid error category.\r\n- All error classes define an error state that is valid.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-24T06:03:34Z","updated_at":"2024-01-26T15:03:34Z","closed_at":"2024-01-26T14:26:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1592132addc7a3f65a6930c8f9a1061ae837701","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b01dbdae5561b4b4884098500e2fcba03b954eb1","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-46819-error-data-automation","ref":"SPARK-46819-error-data-automation","sha":"b01dbdae5561b4b4884098500e2fcba03b954eb1","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the past few PRs, we mistakenly remove `new_msg` which introduces error message regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo API change, but the user-facing error message is improved\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType\r\n>>> schema = StructType([\r\n...     StructField(\"name\", StringType(), nullable=True),\r\n...     StructField(\"age\", IntegerType(), nullable=False)\r\n... ])\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([([\"asd\", None])], schema)\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkValueError: [CANNOT_BE_NONE] Argument `obj` cannot be None.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType\r\n>>> schema = StructType([\r\n...     StructField(\"name\", StringType(), nullable=True),\r\n...     StructField(\"age\", IntegerType(), nullable=False)\r\n... ])\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([([\"asd\", None])], schema)\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkValueError: field age: This field is not nullable, but got None\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing CI should pass\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR partially reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d6334a3ba87c39fff6ace04e43e760d86674551e (with https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/b303eced7f8639887278db34e0080ffa0c19bd0c) by removing the check of Py4J and PySpark libraries when initial lookup of Python Data Sources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe actually guard the case by try-catch already so we don't need to check the existence.\r\n\r\nSome people might want to use system-installed Py4J instead. In addition, PySpark source location might vary as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nVirtually, no. The main change has not been released yet. It will relax the condition of loading initial Python Data Sources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR improves the error messages for the `Range` function when the input arguments are not foldable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make error messages more user-friendly.\r\nFor example, before this PR, Spark throws an internal error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM range(0, (select 1));\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Cannot evaluate expression: scalar-subquery#1306 [] SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, the error message will be:\r\n```\r\n[NON_FOLDABLE_ARGUMENT] The function `range` requires the parameter `end` to be a foldable expression of the type \"BIGINT\", but the actual argument is a non-foldable. SQLSTATE: 42K08; line 1 pos 14\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Error message improvement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew SQL tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for
