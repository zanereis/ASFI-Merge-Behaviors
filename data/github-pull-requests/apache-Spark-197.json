Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes the old Probot Autolabeler labeling configuration, as the probot autolabeler has been deprecated. I've updated the configs in Iceberg and in Avro, and we also need to update here. This PR adds in an additional workflow for labeling PRs and migrates the old probot config to the new format. Unfortunately, because certain features have not been released upstream, we will not get the _exact_ behavior as before. I have documented where that is and what changes are neeeded, and in the associated ticket I've also discussed other options and why I think this is the best way to go. Definitely a follow up ticket is needed to get the original behavior back in these few cases, but PRs have not been labeled for almost a month and so it's probably best to get it right 95% of the time and occasionally have some UI related PRs labeled as `CORE` while the issue is resolved upstream and/or further investigated. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe probot autolabeler is dead and will not be maintained going forward. This has been confirmed with github user [at]mithro in an issue in their repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTo test this PR, I first merged the config into my local fork. I then edited it several times and ran tests on that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I've overwritten my fork with the apache repo in order to create a proper PR. However, I've also added the config for the same thing in the Iceberg repo as well as the Avro repo.\r\n\r\nI have now merged this PR into my local repo and will be running some tests on edge cases there and for validating in general:\r\n- [Check that the SQL label is applied for changes directly below repo root's sql directory](https://github.com/kbendick/spark/pull/16) ✅ \r\n- [Check that the structured streaming label is applied](https://github.com/kbendick/spark/pull/20) ✅ \r\n- [Check that a wildcard at the end of a pattern will match nested files](https://github.com/kbendick/spark/pull/19) ✅ \r\n- [Check that the rule **/*pom.xml will match the root pom.xml file](https://github.com/kbendick/spark/pull/25) ✅ \r\n\r\nI've also discovered that we're likely not killing github actions that run (like large tests etc) when users push to their PR. In most cases, I see that a user has to mark something as \"OK to test\", but it still seems like we might want to discuss whether or not we should add a cancellation step In order to save time / capacity on the runners. If so desired, we would add an action in each workflow that cancels old runs when a `push` action occurs on a PR. This will likely make waiting for test runners much faster iff tests are automatically rerun on push by anybody (such as PMCs, PRs that have been marked OK to test, etc). We could free a large number of resources potentially if a cancellation step was added to all of the workflows in the Apache account (as github action API limits are set at the account level).\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the fact that the \"old\" workflow runs weren't cancelled could admittedly be because of the fact that I was working in a fork, but given that there are explicit actions to be added to the start of workflows to cancel old PR workflows and given that we don't have them configured indicates to me that likely this is the case in this repo (and in most `apache` repos as well), at least under certain circumstances (e.g. repos that don't have \"Ok to test\"-like webhooks as one example).\r\n\r\nThis is a separate issue though, which I can bring up on the mailing list once I'm done with this PR. Unfortunately I've been very busy the past two weeks, but if somebody else wanted to work on that I would be happy to support with any knowledge I have.\r\n\r\nThe last Apache repo to still have the probot autolabeler in it is Beam, at which point we can have Gavin from ASF Infra remove the permissions for the probot autolabeler entirely. See the associated JIRA ticket for the links to other tickets, like the one for ASF Infra to remove the dead probot autolabeler's read and write permissions to our PRs in the Apache organization.

between `!context.isCompleted() && !context.isInterrupted()` and `iter.hasNext` in the `hasNext` method.\r\nThis is because the `TaskCompletion` event thread could close the upstream iterator even

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds support for Converting Java Enums on CatalystTypeConverters. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33330\r\n\r\nGiven that:\r\n\r\nJavaTypeInference maps [Enums to StringType ](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/55105a0784459331d5506eee9f37c2e655a2a6a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/JavaTypeInference.scala#L135)\r\nThe converter for [StringType is StringConverter](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/55105a0784459331d5506eee9f37c2e655a2a6a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/CatalystTypeConverters.scala#L64)\r\nStringConverter is [unable to convert an Enums to UTF8String](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/55105a0784459331d5506eee9f37c2e655a2a6a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/CatalystTypeConverters.scala#L294), failing with an InvalidArgumentException\r\n \r\n\r\nIt can be argued that CatalystTypeConverters should align with the exprectations set by JavaTypeInference and convert enums to their string representation. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n~~No~~  Yes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to partial resolve SPARK-33285. \r\n\r\n`Auto-application` is dropped in Scala 3 and deprecated in 2.13.3 (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/8833) now. So we should add the parens when accessed empty-paren method.\r\n\r\nFor example, if definition as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClass Foo {\r\n   def bar(): Unit = {}\r\n}\r\nval foo = new Foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n`foo.bar()` is  recommend , not `foo.bar`. So the main change of this pr is only add the parens where needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\neliminate compilation warnings in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-03T14:11:31Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T03:45:23Z","closed_at":"2020-12-21T17:01:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"448ac101b5c8f9969b2f9a1c4baf813a65bb0ac3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `ANALYZE TABLE` and `ANALYZE TABLE ... FOR COLUMNS` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `ANALYZE TABLE` is not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes allow consistent resolution behavior when resolving the table/view identifier. For example, the following is the current behavior:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"create temporary view t as select 1\")\r\nsql(\"create database db\")\r\nsql(\"create table db.t using csv as select 1\")\r\nsql(\"use db\")\r\nsql(\"ANALYZE TABLE t compute statistics\") // Succeeds\r\n```\r\nWith this change, ANALYZE TABLE above fails with the following:\r\n```\r\n    org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view not table or permanent view.; line 1 pos 0\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveTempViews$$anonfun$apply$7.$anonfun$applyOrElse$40(Analyzer.scala:872)\r\n\tat scala.Option.map(Option.scala:230)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveTempViews$$anonfun$apply$7.applyOrElse(Analyzer.scala:870)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveTempViews$$anonfun$apply$7.applyOrElse(Analyzer.scala:856)\r\n```\r\n, which is expected since temporary view is resolved first and ANALYZE TABLE doesn't support a temporary view.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `ANALYZE TABLE t` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of table `db.t`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-11-03T01:09:27Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T06:50:51Z","closed_at":"2020-11-04T06:50:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41772fb7d7f292a3c76e0660270f2d756fdf5839","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c80e8eb5828ff68a1ebab4f9ee56b55b852ba7d0","head":{"label":"imback82:parse_v1table","ref":"parse_v1table","sha":"c80e8eb5828ff68a1ebab4f9ee56b55b852ba7d0","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

StringType to Avro type [\"null\",\"string\"]`. With this change it will assume that the data is non-nullable, log a warning message for the nullability difference and serialize the data to Avro format with the nullable Avro schema provided.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is needed because sometimes our users do not have full control over the nullability of the Avro schemas they use, and this change provides them with the flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Users are allowed to use nullable Avro schemas for data with non-nullable catalyst schemas in Avro writing after the change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-02T10:27:14Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T05:43:19Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T04:27:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb358d40e9a3ecf41bc194ac406688d8d3d06c7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d4a839580cedc3e80ea292ad11cafa044248bd9","head":{"label":"bozhang2820:avro-nullable","ref":"avro-nullable","sha":"6d4a839580cedc3e80ea292ad11cafa044248bd9","user":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295316675,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTUzMTY2NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"bozhang2820/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a check to  RowReader#hasNextRow such that multiple calls to RowReader#hasNextRow with no intervening call to RowReader#nextRow will avoid consuming more than 1 record.\r\n\r\nThis PR also modifies RowReader#nextRow such that consecutive calls will return new rows (previously consecutive calls would return the same row).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-32346 slightly refactored the AvroFileFormat and AvroPartitionReaderFactory to use a new iterator-like trait called AvroUtils#RowReader. RowReader#hasNextRow consumes a raw input record and stores the deserialized row for the next call to RowReader#nextRow. Unfortunately, sometimes hasNextRow is called twice before nextRow is called, resulting in a lost row.\r\n\r\nFor example (which assumes V1 Avro reader):\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.range(0, 25).toDF(\"index\")\r\ndf.write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"avro\").save(\"index_avro\")\r\nval loaded = spark.read.format(\"avro\").load(\"index_avro\")\r\n// The following will give the expected size\r\nloaded.collect.size\r\n// The following will give the wrong size\r\nloaded.orderBy(\"index\").collect.size\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded tests, which fail without the fix.","created_at":"2020-11-02T01:03:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T00:25:28Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T02:50:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13bacb2f8d016d90e625abbcc78af14c8c67e7ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/134c12cc876372e73eaea2428fb70826da3ab83d","head":{"label":"bersprockets:avro_iterator_play","ref":"avro_iterator_play","sha":"134c12cc876372e73eaea2428fb70826da3ab83d","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #30177.\r\n\r\nAs the Python evaluation consumes the parent iterator in a separate thread, it could consume more data from the parent even after the task ends and the parent is closed. Thus, we should use `ContextAwareIterator` to stop consuming after the task ends.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython/Pandas UDF right after off-heap vectorized reader could cause executor crash.\r\n\r\nE.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nspark.range(0, 100000, 1, 1).write.parquet(path)\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.columnVector.offheap.enabled\", True)\r\n\r\ndef f(x):\r\n    return 0\r\n\r\nfUdf = udf(f, LongType())\r\n\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).select(fUdf('id')).head()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because, the Python evaluation consumes the parent iterator in a separate thread and it consumes more data from the parent even after the task ends and the parent is closed. If an off-heap column vector exists in the parent iterator, it could cause segmentation fault which crashes the executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests, and manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-01T21:02:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T00:12:09Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T00:08:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdd51f86b42d3e896a0c973e2c44d3f6eb1b615e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/001a5866c62b9a42344561aee2d3d6f175e74dad","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-33277/2.4/python_pandas_udf","ref":"issues/SPARK-33277/2.4/python_pandas_udf","sha":"001a5866c62b9a42344561aee2d3d6f175e74dad","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #30177.\r\n\r\nAs the Python evaluation consumes the parent iterator in a separate thread, it could consume more data from the parent even after the task ends and the parent is closed. Thus, we should use `ContextAwareIterator` to stop consuming after the task ends.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython/Pandas UDF right after off-heap vectorized reader could cause executor crash.\r\n\r\nE.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nspark.range(0, 100000, 1, 1).write.parquet(path)\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.columnVector.offheap.enabled\", True)\r\n\r\ndef f(x):\r\n    return 0\r\n\r\nfUdf = udf(f, LongType())\r\n\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).select(fUdf('id')).head()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because, the Python evaluation consumes the parent iterator in a separate thread and it consumes more data from the parent even after the task ends and the parent is closed. If an off-heap column vector exists in the parent iterator, it could cause segmentation fault which crashes the executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests, and manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-01T19:59:16Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T00:27:22Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T00:08:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfcc2657db79d4aa1017741e79dd3e4824f6ced2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2680b01fedfa51cb4999d627633a95bb93216d0","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-33277/3.0/python_pandas_udf","ref":"issues/SPARK-33277/3.0/python_pandas_udf","sha":"a2680b01fedfa51cb4999d627633a95bb93216d0","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `CatalogImpl.refreshTable`, this moves the `uncacheQuery` call out of the condition `if (cache.nonEmpty)` so that it will be called whether the table itself is cached or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the case like the following:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t ...;\r\nCREATE VIEW t1 AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\nREFRESH TABLE t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the table `t` is refreshed, the view `t1` which is depending on `t` will not be invalidated. This could lead to incorrect result and is similar to [SPARK-19765](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19765).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we have:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t ...;\r\nCACHE TABLE t;\r\nCREATE VIEW t1 AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\nREFRESH TABLE t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the view `t1` will be refreshed. The behavior is somewhat inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, with the change any cache that are depending on the table refreshed will be invalidated with the change.

support  as flexible as Postgres SQL to support subsequent development.\r\nIn  postgres sql, it support \r\n```\r\nselect a, b, c, count(1) from t group by cube (a, b, c);\r\nselect a, b, c, count(1) from t group by cube(a, b, c);\r\nselect a, b, c, count(1) from t group by cube (a, b, c, (a, b), (a, b, c));\r\nselect a, b, c, count(1) from t group by rollup(a, b, c);\r\nselect a, b, c, count(1) from t group by rollup (a, b, c);\r\nselect a, b, c, count(1) from t group by rollup (a, b, c, (a, b), (a, b, c));\r\n```\r\nIn this pr,  we have done three things as below, and we will split it to different pr:\r\n\r\n - Refactor CUBE/ROLLUP (regarding them as ANTLR tokens in a parser)\r\n - Refactor GROUPING SETS (the logical node -> a new expr)\r\n - Support new syntax for CUBE/ROLLUP (e.g., GROUP BY CUBE ((a, b), (a, c)))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRewrite current Grouping Analytics grammar to support  as flexible as Postgres SQL to support subsequent development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can  write Grouping Analytics grammar as flexible as Postgres SQL to support subsequent development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-31T04:02:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T12:44:17Z","closed_at":"2021-03-30T12:32:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9de73f1e33110e2ce2089e71812ab73a410988a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bfc03afaf9fc0974cb218b3b3121829ae9e5c413","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:refact-grouping-analytics","ref":"refact-grouping-analytics","sha":"bfc03afaf9fc0974cb218b3b3121829ae9e5c413","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes `DropTableExec` to also invalidate caches referencing the table to be dropped, in a cascading manner. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn DSv1, `DROP TABLE` command also invalidate caches as described in [SPARK-19765](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19765). However in DSv2 the same command only drops the table but doesn't handle the caches. This could lead to correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now DSv2 `DROP TABLE` command also invalidates cache.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new UT

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to disable the streaming query with possible correctness issue in chained stateful operators. The behavior can be controlled by a SQL config, so if users understand the risk and still want to run the query, they can disable the check.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe possible correctness in chained stateful operators in streaming query is not straightforward for users. From users perspective, it will be considered as a Spark bug. It is also possible the worse case, users are not aware of the correctness issue and use wrong results.\r\n\r\nA better approach should be to disable such queries and let users choose to run the query if they understand there is such risk, instead of implicitly running the query and let users to find out correctness issue by themselves and report this known to Spark community. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Streaming query with possible correctness issue will be blocked to run, except for users explicitly disable the SQL config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRelax pyspark typing for sql str functions. These functions all pass the first argument through `_to_java_column`, such that a string or Column object is acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nConvenience & ensuring the typing reflects the functionality\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a backwards-compatible increase in functionality. But I think typing support is unreleased, so possibly no change to released versions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot tested. I am newish to Python typing with stubs, so someone should confirm this is the correct way to fix

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR checks that the type of the extracted column is compatible with the type of the literal. If they're not compatible, it attempts to make them compatible. If that fails, the binary comparison is not used in the final filter expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid unnecessary MetaExceptions.\r\n\r\nSPARK-22384 expanded the types of filters that ```Shim_v0_13#convertFilters``` can handle to include filters that contain CAST expressions. This opened up the door for Spark to push down partition filters with mismatched datatypes.\r\n\r\nTake this example: Spark passes the filter ```'cast(b as string) = \"2\"'``` to convertFilters, where b is an integral column. The integral column b is extracted from the CAST expression, but the literal is left as-is, resulting in the following filter getting pushed down to the metastore:\r\n\r\n```b = \"2\"```\r\n\r\nHive throws a MetaException complaining that an integer column is being compared to a string literal (with the very misleading message \"Filtering is supported only on partition keys of type string\")\r\n\r\nHere are some examples that throw a MetaException:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"create table test (a int) partitioned by (b int) stored as parquet\")\r\nsql(\"insert into test values (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)\")\r\n\r\n// These throw MetaExceptions\r\nsql(\"select * from test where b in ('2')\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select * from test where cast(b as string) = '2'\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select * from test where cast(b as string) in ('2')\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select * from test where cast(b as string) in (2)\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select cast(b as string) as b from test where b in ('2')\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select cast(b as string) as b from test\").filter(\"b = '2'\").show(false) // [1]\r\nsql(\"select cast(b as string) as b from test\").filter(\"b in (2)\").show(false) // [2]\r\nsql(\"select cast(b as string) as b from test\").filter(\"b in ('2')\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select * from test where cast(b as string) > '1'\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"select cast(b as string) b from test\").filter(\"b > '1'\").show(false) // [3]\r\n\r\n// [1] but not sql(\"select cast(b as string) as b from test where b = '2'\").show(false)\r\n// [2] but not sql(\"select cast(b as string) as b from test where b in (2)\").show(false)\r\n// [3] but not sql(\"select cast(b as string) b from test where b > '1'\").show(false)\r\n```\r\nIn fact, all the failures I could find boil down to the following partition filter getting pushed down to the metastore:\r\n\r\n```<col-name-of-integral-column> <binary-comparison> \"<string-literal>\"```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2020-10-30T17:37:46Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T00:26:02Z","closed_at":"2020-11-24T01:02:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c6d240f4e649f5f1d5f364c46c28c779ab3162f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a186127197321f4dd3c52ac69784f44e938c5823","head":{"label":"bersprockets:filter_play","ref":"filter_play","sha":"a186127197321f4dd3c52ac69784f44e938c5823","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis adds support for Stage level scheduling to kubernetes. Kubernetes can support dynamic allocation via the shuffle tracking option which means we can support stage level scheduling by getting new executors.  \r\nThe main changes here are having the k8s cluster manager pass the resource profile id into the executors and then the ExecutorsPodsAllocator has to request executors based on the individual resource profiles.  I tried to keep code changes here to a minimum. I specifically choose to leave the ExecutorPodsSnapshot the way it was and construct the resource profile to pod states on the fly, with a fast path when not using other resource profiles, to keep the impact to a minimum.  This results in the main changes required are just wrapping the allocation logic in a for loop over each profile.  The other main change is in the basic feature step we have to look at the resources in the ResourceProfile to request pods with the correct resources.  Much of the other logic like in the executor life cycle manager doesn't need to be resource profile.\r\n\r\nThis also adds support for [SPARK-32661]Spark executors on K8S should request extra memory for off-heap allocations because the stage level scheduling api has support for this and it made sense to make consistent with YARN.  This was started with PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29477 but never updated so I just did it here.   To do this I moved a few functions around that were now used by both YARN and kubernetes so you will see some changes in Utils.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the feature to Kubernetes based on customer feedback.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes the feature now works with K8s, but not underlying API changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTested manually on kubernetes cluster and with unit tests.","created_at":"2020-10-30T16:15:23Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T22:42:13Z","closed_at":"2020-11-13T22:05:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"533c7298893237f87ee8bc50a0497df2f532f807","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f5321ffe8637ae32434ac2d5eaff476fc3e0d19","head":{"label":"tgravescs:stagek8sOrigSnapshotsRebase","ref":"stagek8sOrigSnapshotsRebase","sha":"6f5321ffe8637ae32434ac2d5eaff476fc3e0d19","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

change more readable\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn Spark 3.1, when script transformation output's value size less then schema size in default-serde mode(script transformation with row format of `ROW FORMAT DELIMITED`), Spark will pad NUll value to supplement data. In Spark 3.0 or earlier, Spark will do nothing and throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. To restore the behavior before Spark 3.1, you can set `spark.sql.legacy.transformationNotPadNullToSupplementData.enabled` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove schema parsing from `from_json` in Scala API to the common function in `ExprUtils.evalTypeExpr` which is used in the `JsonToStructs` and `CsvToStructs` expressions, and as a consequence in SQL API, for instance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `from_json` has different behavior in Scala API and in PySpark/SQL. In Scala API, it accepts schema in JSON format. To improve user experience with Spark SQL and PySpark, this PR proposes to unify the behavior of `from_json` and `from_csv`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore (in Spark 3.0)\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_json('{\"a\":1}', '{\"type\" : \"map\", \"keyType\" : \"string\", \"valueType\" : \"integer\", \"valueContainsNull\" : true}');\r\nError in query:\r\nmismatched input '{' expecting {'ADD', 'AFTER', ...}(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\n{\"type\" : \"map\", \"keyType\" : \"string\", \"valueType\" : \"integer\", \"valueContainsNull\" : true}\r\n^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_json('{\"a\":1}', '{\"type\" : \"map\", \"keyType\" : \"string\", \"valueType\" : \"integer\", \"valueContainsNull\" : true}');\r\n{\"a\":1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases to `csv-functions.sql` and `json-functions.sq`","created_at":"2020-10-30T08:08:50Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:54Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T18:10:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7de84f2f92845bf3453c7760cbb3628da8a0efc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30201/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30201/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30201/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88cd2a3354e587861f3214b94d0cadc8bc163747","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:from_json-common-schema-parsing","ref":"from_json-common-schema-parsing","sha":"88cd2a3354e587861f3214b94d0cadc8bc163747","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs a followup comment from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29804#issuecomment-700650620 , here we add add the physical plan rule DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScan into AQE AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.queryStagePreparationRules, to make auto bucketed scan work with AQE.\r\n\r\nThe change is mostly in:\r\n* `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala`: add physical plan rule `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScan`\r\n* `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScan.scala`: propagate logical plan link for the file source scan exec operator, otherwise we lose the logical plan link information when AQE is enabled, and will get exception [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala#L176). (for example, for query `SELECT * FROM bucketed_table` with AQE is enabled)\r\n* `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScanSuite.scala`: add new test suite for AQE enabled - `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScanWithoutHiveSupportSuiteAE`, and changed some of tests to use `AdaptiveSparkPlanHelper.find/collect`, to make the plan verification work when AQE enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's reasonable to add the support to allow disabling unnecessary bucketed scan with AQE is enabled, this helps optimize the query when AQE is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScanSuite`.","created_at":"2020-10-30T05:25:32Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T07:46:52Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T06:44:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e09d92a7eaed01bc826685a1ff9894b61e910a9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36815fc2d7ef1f436db3fc26b3dffa924d5b65ae","head":{"label":"c21:auto-bucket-aqe","ref":"auto-bucket-aqe","sha":"36815fc2d7ef1f436db3fc26b3dffa924d5b65ae","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of SPARK-33292.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to wrap `ArrayBasedMapData` literal representation with `map(...)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLiteral ArrayBasedMapData has inconsistent string representation from `LogicalPlan` to `Optimized Logical Plan/Physical Plan`. Also, the representation at `Optimized Logical Plan` and `Physical Plan` is ambiguous like `[1 AS a#0, keys: [key1], values: [value1] AS b#1]`.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 2.4.7\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1 a, map('key1', 'value1') b\").explain(true)\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [1 AS a#0, 'map(key1, value1) AS b#1]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, b: map<string,string>\r\nProject [1 AS a#0, map(key1, value1) AS b#1]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [1 AS a#0, keys: [key1], values: [value1] AS b#1]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [1 AS a#0, keys: [key1], values: [value1] AS b#1]\r\n+- Scan OneRowRelation[]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1 a, map('key1', 'value1') b\").explain(true)\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [1 AS a#4, 'map(key1, value1) AS b#5]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, b: map<string,string>\r\nProject [1 AS a#4, map(key1, value1) AS b#5]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [1 AS a#4, map(keys: [key1], values: [value1]) AS b#5]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [1 AS a#4, map(keys: [key1], values: [value1]) AS b#5]\r\n+- *(1) Scan OneRowRelation[]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This changes the query plan's string representation in `explain` command and UI. However, this is a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CI with the newly added test case.","created_at":"2020-10-30T02:52:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T07:08:08Z","closed_at":"2020-10-30T05:50:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4f47aa42cb72b2eb35b3b2695a721a8bd411cc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e579ea3a1e480b6793ac2af69187c8c1767e1ad1","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-33292-2.4","ref":"SPARK-33292-2.4","sha":"e579ea3a1e480b6793ac2af69187c8c1767e1ad1","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-2.4","ref":"branch-2.4","sha":"bf4d7a6cedf53693a90cbe3489b3f780fe2786d0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

It also adds a new physical rule to remove redundant sorts that cannot be eliminated in the Optimizer rule after the bugfix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA global sort should not be eliminated even if its child is ordered since we don't know if its child ordering is global or local. For example, in the following scenario, the first sort shouldn't be removed because it has a stronger guarantee than the second sort even if the sort orders are the same for both sorts.\r\n```\r\nSort(orders, global = True, ...)\r\n  Sort(orders, global = False, ...)\r\n```\r\nSince there is no straightforward way to identify whether a node's output ordering is local or

#30093 for branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix a correctness bug in the optimizer rule EliminateSorts. It also adds a new physical rule to remove redundant sorts that cannot be eliminated in the Optimizer rule after the bugfix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA global sort should not be eliminated even if its child is ordered since we don't know if its child ordering is global or local. For example, in the following scenario, the first sort shouldn't be removed because it has a stronger guarantee than the second sort even if the sort orders are the same for both sorts.\r\n```\r\nSort(orders, global = True, ...)\r\n  Sort(orders, global = False, ...)\r\n```\r\nSince there is no straightforward way to identify whether a node's output ordering is local or global, we should not remove a global sort even if its child is already ordered.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRefactor `WriteToDataSourceV2Exec` via removing code duplication around write to table logic:\r\n- renamed `AtomicTableWriteExec` to `TableWriteExec` so that the table write logic in this trait can be modified and shared with `CreateTableAsSelectExec`, `ReplaceTableAsSelectExec`, `AtomicCreateTableAsSelectExec ` and `AtomicReplaceTableAsSelectExec`.\r\n- similar to the above, renamed `writeToStagedTable` to `writeToTable` in `TableWriteExec`.\r\n- extended `writeToTable` so that it can handle both staged table as well as non-staged table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimplify the logic and remove duplication, to make this piece of code easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass CIs with the existing test

A sequence of queries to reproduce this issue is as follows;\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import Row\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import col\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>> from pyspark.testing.sqlutils import *\r\n>>> \r\n>>> row = Row(point=ExamplePoint(1.0, 2.0))\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([row])\r\n>>> df.select(col(\"point\").cast(PythonOnlyUDT()))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 1402, in select\r\n    jdf = self._jdf.select(self._jcols(*cols))\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1305, in __call__\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 111, in deco\r\n    return f(*a, **kw)\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9-src.zip/py4j/protocol.py\", line 328, in get_return_value\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o44.select.\r\n: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.UserDefinedType.acceptsType(UserDefinedType.scala:84)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Cast$.canCast(Cast.scala:96)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CastBase.checkInputDataTypes(Cast.scala:267)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CastBase.resolved$lzycompute(Cast.scala:290)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CastBase.resolved(Cast.scala:290)\r\n```\r\nA root cause of this issue is that, since `PythonUserDefinedType#userClassis` always null, `isAssignableFrom` in `UserDefinedType#acceptsType` throws a null exception. To fix it, this PR defines  `acceptsType` in `PythonUserDefinedType` and filters out the null case in `UserDefinedType#acceptsType`.\r\n\r\nThis backport comes from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30169.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

To fix it, this PR defines  `acceptsType` in `PythonUserDefinedType` and filters out the null case in `UserDefinedType#acceptsType`.\r\n\r\nThis backport comes from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30169.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to wrap `ArrayBasedMapData` literal representation with `map(...)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLiteral ArrayBasedMapData has inconsistent string representation from `LogicalPlan` to `Optimized Logical Plan/Physical Plan`. Also, the representation at `Optimized Logical Plan` and `Physical Plan` is ambiguous like `[1 AS a#0, keys: [key1], values: [value1] AS b#1]`.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 2.4.7\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1 a, map('key1', 'value1') b\").explain(true)\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [1 AS a#0, 'map(key1, value1) AS b#1]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, b: map<string,string>\r\nProject [1 AS a#0, map(key1, value1) AS b#1]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [1 AS a#0, keys: [key1], values: [value1] AS b#1]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [1 AS a#0, keys: [key1], values: [value1] AS b#1]\r\n+- Scan OneRowRelation[]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1 a, map('key1', 'value1') b\").explain(true)\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [1 AS a#4, 'map(key1, value1) AS b#5]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, b: map<string,string>\r\nProject [1 AS a#4, map(key1, value1) AS b#5]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [1 AS a#4, map(keys: [key1], values: [value1]) AS b#5]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [1 AS a#4, map(keys: [key1], values: [value1]) AS b#5]\r\n+- *(1) Scan OneRowRelation[]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This changes the query plan's string representation in `explain` command and UI. However, this is a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CI with the newly added test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe changes in [SPARK-32501 Inconsistent NULL conversions to strings](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32501) introduced some behavior that I'd like to clean up a bit.\r\n\r\nHere's sample code to illustrate the behavior I'd like to clean up:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval rows = Seq[String](null)\r\n  .toDF(\"value\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"struct1\", struct('value as \"value1\"))\r\n  .withColumn(\"struct2\", struct('value as \"value1\", 'value as \"value2\"))\r\n  .withColumn(\"array1\", array('value))\r\n  .withColumn(\"array2\", array('value, 'value))\r\n\r\n// Show the DataFrame using the \"first\" codepath.        \r\nrows.show(truncate=false)\r\n+-----+-------+-------------+------+--------+\r\n|value|struct1|struct2      |array1|array2  |\r\n+-----+-------+-------------+------+--------+\r\n|null |{ null}|{ null, null}|[]    |[, null]|\r\n+-----+-------+-------------+------+--------+\r\n\r\n// Write the DataFrame to disk, then read it back and show it to trigger the \"codegen\" code path:\r\nrows.write.parquet(\"rows\")\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"rows\").show(truncate=false)\r\n\r\n+-----+-------+-------------+-------+-------------+\r\n|value|struct1|struct2      |array1 |array2       |\r\n+-----+-------+-------------+-------+-------------+\r\n|null |{ null}|{ null, null}|[ null]|[ null, null]|\r\n+-----+-------+-------------+-------+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice:\r\n\r\n1. If the first element of a struct is null, it is printed with a leading space (e.g. \"\\{ null\\}\").  I think it's preferable to print it without the leading space (e.g. \"\\{null\\}\").  This is consistent with how non-null values are printed inside a struct.\r\n2. If the first element of an array is null, it is not printed at all in the first code path, and the \"codegen\" code path prints it with a leading space.  I think both code paths should be consistent and print it without a leading space (e.g. \"[null]\").\r\n\r\nThe desired result of this PR is to product the following output via both code paths:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-------+------------+------+------------+\r\n|value|struct1|struct2     |array1|array2      |\r\n+-----+-------+------------+------+------------+\r\n|null |{null} |{null, null}|[null]|[null, null]|\r\n+-----+-------+------------+------+------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `CatalogImpl.refreshTable`, this moves the `uncacheQuery` call out of the condition `if (cache.nonEmpty)` so that it will be called whether the table itself is cached or not. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the case like the following:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t ...;\r\nCREATE VIEW t1 AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\nREFRESH TABLE t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the table `t` is refreshed, the view `t1` which is depending on `t` will not be invalidated. This could lead to incorrect result and is similar to [SPARK-19765](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19765). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we have:\r\n\r\n```sql \r\nCREATE TABLE t ...;\r\nCACHE TABLE t;\r\nCREATE VIEW t1 AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\nREFRESH TABLE t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the view `t1` will be refreshed. The behavior is somewhat inconsistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, with the change any cache that are depending on the table refreshed will be invalidated with the change. Previously this only happens if the table itself is cached.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new UT for the case.","created_at":"2020-10-29T19:32:24Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T03:23:44Z","closed_at":"2020-10-31T16:49:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4f3ceefeaf7e1276f677f7a3bfd5703d0a417d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b427b7d1c0e5b60f96d9a38c7d00dff43d15e423","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-33290","ref":"SPARK-33290","sha":"b427b7d1c0e5b60f96d9a38c7d00dff43d15e423","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes new logic to store the constraint and track aliases in projection which eliminates the need of pessimistically generating all the permutations of a given constraint. It is also more effective in correctly identifying the filters which can be pruned, apart from minimizing the memory used as compared to the current code. This also has changes to push compound filters if the join condition is on multiple attributes and the constraint comprises of more than 1 attributes of the join conditions.\r\n\r\nRight now the code retains the old logic of constraint management along with the new logic. It is controlled by a sql conf property \"spark.sql.optimizer.optimizedConstraintPropagation.enabled\" which is by default true. Once the PR is approved it would make sense to remove the old code & merge the code of ConstraintSet into ExpressionSet and removing certain if else blocks in the Optimizer & the function Optimizer.getAllConstraints and LogicalPlan.getAllValidConstraints.\r\nIt is the code of getAllValidConstraints which generates all the permutations of the base constraint.\r\n\r\nThe new logic is as follows:\r\nIn the class ConstraintSet which extends ExpressionSet, we track the aliases , along with the base constraint.\r\nAny constraint which is added to the ConstraintSet is stored in the most canonicalized form (i.e consisting of only those attributes which are part of the output set and NOT the Alias's attribute).\r\n\r\nfor eg consider a hypothetical plan\r\nProjection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n|\r\nFilter ( a + b > 10)\r\n|\r\nbase relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\nAt the node Filter the constraint set will just have constraint a + b > 10\r\nAt the Node Projection1 , the constraint set will have\r\nconstraint a + b > 10\r\nand maintain following buffers\r\nbuff1 -> a , a1.attribute, a2. attribute\r\nbuff2 -> b, b1.attribute, b2.attribute\r\nbuff3 -> a + b, z.attribute\r\n\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 is already canonicalized in terms of output attributes.\r\n\r\nNow suppose there are two filters on top of projection1\r\nFilter( z > 10) and Filter ( a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n\r\nTo prune the above two filters, we canonicalize z as a + b ( from the data maintained in the constraintset) & check if the underlying set contains a +b > 10 & so can be pruned.\r\nFor Filter a1 + b2 > 10, we identify the buffer to which a1 & b2 belong to and replace it with 0th elements of the buffer, which will yield a +b > 10, and so filter can be pruned.\r\n\r\nNow suppose there is another Project2 ( a1, a2, b1, b2, z, c)\r\ni.e say attributes a & b are no longer part of outputset.\r\nThe idea is that \"as much as possible try to make a constraint survive).\r\nSo in Project2 , the atttributes a & b are being eliminated.\r\nwe have a constraint a + b > 10 which is dependent on it.\r\nso in the constraintset of the ProjectP2, we update it such that\r\na + b > 10 becomes ----> a1.attr + b1.attr > 10\r\nbuff1 a , a1.attribute, a2. attribute ---> a1.attribute, a2. attribute\r\nbuff2 b , b1.attribute, b2. attribute ---> b1.attribute, b2. attribute\r\nbuff3 a +b , z.attribute -->. a1.attr + b1.attr , z.attr\r\n\r\nThis way by tracking aliases & just storing the canonicalized base constraints we can eliminate the need of pessimistically generating all combination of constraints.\r\n\r\nFor inferring new Filter from constraints ,\r\nwe use following logic\r\nNew Filter = Filter.constraints -- ( Filter.child.constraints ++ Filter.constraints.convertToCanonicalizedIfRequired(Filter.conditions) )\r\nSo the idea is that new filter conditions without redundancy can be obtained by difference of current node's constraints & the child node's constraints & the condition itself properly canonicalized in terms of base attributes which will be part of the output set of filter node.\r\n\r\nFor inferring new filters for Join push down, we identify all the equality conditions & then the attributes are segregated on the lines of LHS & RHS of joins. So to identify filters for push down on RHS side, we get all equality atttributes of LHS side & ask the constraintset to return all the constraints which are subset of the passed LHS attributes. The LHS attributes are appropriately canonicalized & the constrainst identified.\r\nOnce the constraints are know, we can replace the attributes with the corresponding RHS attributes. This helps in identifying the compound filters for push down & not just single attribute filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is a description of the changes proposed.\r\n\r\nExpressionSet: Apart from adding some new functions, fixed the two bugs in the ExpressionSet where in filter & filterNot, e.canonicalized was being used. e is already canonicalized. Also in very complex expressions canonicalization of a canonicalized object ( especially if contains a join expression ) does not behave correctly in current spark code.\r\nThe ExpressionSet has added methods just to retain the existing constraints code.\r\n\r\nConstraintSet: This is the class which does the tracking of the aliases , stores the constraints in the canonicalized form, updates the constraints using available aliases if any of the attribute comprising constraint is getting eliminated. The contains method of this class is used for filter pruning. It also identifies those constraints which can generated new filters for push down in join nodes.\r\n\r\nRest all the changes are just to integrate the new logic as well as retain the old constraints logic.\r\n\r\nPls notice that related to tpcds plan stability , I had to add new golden files for q75. The change as such is trivial.\r\npreviously pushed filter was generated as\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_order_number), IsNotNull(cr_item_sk)]\r\nand with the change it is\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_item_sk), IsNotNull(cr_order_number)]\r\n\r\nThis PR also eliminates the need of EqualNullSafe constraints for the alias.\r\nIt also is able to handle the literal boolean constraints.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1) This issue if not fixed can cause OutOfMemory issue or unacceptable query compilation times.\r\nAdded a test \"plan equivalence with case statements and performance comparison with benefit of more than 10x conservatively\"\r\nin\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite\r\n\r\nwith this PR the compilation time is 247 ms vs 13958 ms without the change\r\n2) It is more effective in filter pruning as  is evident in some of the tests in org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite  where current code is not able to identify the redundant filter in some cases.\r\n\r\n3) It is able to generate a better optimized plan for join queries as it can push compound predicates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have been running the target /build/mvn clean install.\r\nAs seen below the sql, catalyst modules are passing cleanly.\r\nThe hive module reports failure due to 1 suite aborted, but no test failures.\r\nI have been told by my colleagues that there is an issue in Hive module ( unrelated to this change).\r\nI am looking further as to what is causing the abort. \r\nIn case if you have any information, please add.\r\n02:25:27.539 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hive.conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.stats.jdbc.timeout does not exist\r\n02:25:27.539 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hive.conf.HiveConf: HiveConf of name hive.stats.retries.wait does not exist\r\nRun completed in 2 hours, 27 minutes, 59 seconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 3123\r\nSuites: completed 108, aborted 1\r\nTests: succeeded 3123, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 18, pending 0\r\n*** 1 SUITE ABORTED ***\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Spark Project Parent POM 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Spark Project Parent POM ...........................

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to improve the error message from `from_json`/`from_csv` by combining errors from all schema parsers:\r\n- DataType.fromJson (except CSV)\r\n- CatalystSqlParser.parseDataType\r\n- CatalystSqlParser.parseTableSchema\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, `from_json` does not show error messages from the first parser in the chain that could mislead users.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `from_json` outputs the error message from the fallback schema parser which can confuse end-users. For example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    val invalidJsonSchema = \"\"\"{\"fields\": [{\"a\":123}], \"type\": \"struct\"}\"\"\"\r\n    df.select(from_json($\"json\", invalidJsonSchema, Map.empty[String, String])).show()\r\n```\r\nThe JSON schema has an issue in `{\"a\":123}` but the error message doesn't point it out:\r\n```\r\nmismatched input '{' expecting {'ADD', 'AFTER', ...}(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\n{\"fields\": [{\"a\":123}], \"type\": \"struct\"}\r\n^^^\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException: \r\nmismatched input '{' expecting {'ADD', 'AFTER',  ... }(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\n{\"fields\": [{\"a\":123}], \"type\": \"struct\"}\r\n^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes for the example above:\r\n```\r\nCannot parse the schema in JSON format: Failed to convert the JSON string '{\"a\":123}' to a field.\r\nFailed fallback parsing: Cannot parse the data type: \r\nmismatched input '{' expecting {'ADD', 'AFTER', ...}(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\n{\"fields\": [{\"a\":123}], \"type\": \"struct\"}\r\n^^^\r\n\r\nFailed fallback parsing: \r\nmismatched input '{' expecting {'ADD', 'AFTER', ...}(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\n{\"fields\": [{\"a\":123}], \"type\": \"struct\"}\r\n^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing tests suites like `JsonFunctionsSuite` and `JsonExpressionsSuite`.\r\n- Add new test to `JsonFunctionsSuite`.\r\n- Re-gen results for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the old version of spark in the storage UI page, the sorting function is normal, but sorting in the new version will cause the header content to be lost, So I try to fix the bug.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe header field of the table on the page is similar to the following, **note that each th contains the span attribute**:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        ....\r\n        <th width=\"\" class=\"\">\r\n              <span data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"\" data-original-title=\"StorageLevel displays where the persisted RDD is stored, format of the persisted RDD (serialized or de-serialized) andreplication factor of the persisted RDD\">\r\n                Storage Level\r\n              </span>\r\n        </th>\r\n       .....\r\n    </tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince  [PR#26136](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26136), if the `th` in the table itself contains the `span` attribute, the `span` will be deleted directly after clicking the sort, and the original header content will be lost.\r\n\r\nThere are three problems  in `sorttable.js`:\r\n\r\n1. `sortrevind.class = \"sorttable_sortrevind\"` in  [sorttab.js#107](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d5e48ea95d1c3017a51ff69584f32a18901b2b5/core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static/sorttable.js#L107) and  `sortfwdind.class = \"sorttable_sortfwdind\"` in  [sorttab.js#125](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d5e48ea95d1c3017a51ff69584f32a18901b2b5/core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static/sorttable.js#L125) \r\nsorttable_xx attribute should be assigned to`className` instead of `class`, as javascript uses `rowlists[j].className.search` rather than `rowlists[j].class.search` to determine whether the component has a sorting flag or not.\r\n2.  `rowlists[j].className.search(/\\sorttable_sortrevind\\b/)` in  [sorttab.js#120](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d5e48ea95d1c3017a51ff69584f32a18901b2b5/core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static/sorttable.js#L120) was wrong. The original intention is to search whether `className` contains  the word `sorttable_sortrevind` , but the expression is wrong,  it should be `\\bsorttable_sortrevind\\b` instead of `\\sorttable_sortrevind\\b`\r\n3. The if check statement in the following code snippet ([sorttab.js#141](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d5e48ea95d1c3017a51ff69584f32a18901b2b5/core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static/sorttable.js#L141)) was wrong. **If the `search` function does not find the target, it will return -1, but Boolean(-1) is actually equals true**. This statement will cause span to be deleted even if it does not contain `sorttable_sortfwdind` or `sorttable_sortrevind`.\r\n```javascript\r\nrowlists = this.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\"span\");\r\nfor (var j=0; j < rowlists.length; j++) {\r\n              if (rowlists[j].className.search(/\\bsorttable_sortfwdind\\b/)\r\n                  || rowlists[j].className.search(/\\sorttable_sortrevind\\b/) ) {\r\n                  rowlists[j].parentNode.removeChild(rowlists[j]);\r\n              }\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe manual test result of the ui page is as below:\r\n\r\n![fix

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReturn schema in SQL format instead of Catalog string from the SchemaOfCsv expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify output of the `schema_of_json()` and `schema_of_csv()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, they can but `schema_of_csv()` is usually used in combination with `from_csv()`, so, the format of schema shouldn't be much matter.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT schema_of_csv('1,abc');\r\n  struct<_c0:int,_c1:string>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT schema_of_csv('1,abc');\r\n  STRUCT<`_c0`: INT, `_c1`: STRING>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `CsvFunctionsSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs the Python evaluation consumes the parent iterator in a separate thread, it could consume more data from the parent even after the task ends and the parent is closed. Thus, we should use `ContextAwareIterator` to stop consuming after the task ends.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython/Pandas UDF right after off-heap vectorized reader could cause executor crash.\r\n\r\nE.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nspark.range(0, 100000, 1, 1).write.parquet(path)\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.columnVector.offheap.enabled\", True)\r\n\r\ndef f(x):\r\n    return 0\r\n\r\nfUdf = udf(f, LongType())\r\n\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).select(fUdf('id')).head()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because, the Python evaluation consumes the parent iterator in a separate thread and it consumes more data from the parent even after the task ends and the parent is closed. If an off-heap column vector exists in the parent iterator, it could cause segmentation fault which crashes the executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests, and manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-29T00:22:45Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T17:40:20Z","closed_at":"2020-11-01T11:28:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a707427b04a246514d8c645fde4ef7d18aed6f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac42502576d428325126a38aac8c179dcbc26f88","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-33277/python_pandas_udf","ref":"issues/SPARK-33277/python_pandas_udf","sha":"ac42502576d428325126a38aac8c179dcbc26f88","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd check for total executor cores when `SetReaderPartitions` message received.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn continuous processing mode, EpochCoordinator won't add offsets to query until got ReportPartitionOffset from all partitions. Normally, each kafka topic partition will be handled by one core, if total cores is smaller than total kafka topic partition counts, the job will hang without any error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if total executor cores is smaller than total kafka partition count, the exception with below error will be thrown:\r\n`Total %s (kafka partitions) * %s (cpus per task) = %s needed, \r\nbut only have %s (executors) * %s (cores per executor) = %s (total cores).\r\nPlease increase total number of executor cores to at least %s.`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor complex query plans, `QueryPlan.transformUpWithNewOutput` will keep accumulating the attributes mapping to be propagated, which may hurt performance.

Such fields will be quoted after the changes, and can be parsed by `from_json()`.\r\n\r\nHere is the example:\r\n```scala\r\nval in = Seq(\"\"\"{\"a b\": 1}\"\"\").toDS()\r\nin.select(from_json('value, schema_of_json(\"\"\"{\"a b\": 100}\"\"\")) as \"parsed\")\r\n```\r\nraises the exception:\r\n```\r\n== SQL ==\r\nstruct<a b:bigint>\r\n------^^^\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException.withCommand(ParseDriver.scala:263)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parse(ParseDriver.scala:130)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parseTableSchema(ParseDriver.scala:76)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType$.fromDDL(DataType.scala:131)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExprUtils$.evalTypeExpr(ExprUtils.scala:33)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.JsonToStructs.<init>(jsonExpressions.scala:537)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.functions$.from_json(functions.scala:4141)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the NPE issue on `In` filter when one of values contain null. In real case, you can trigger this issue when you try to push down the filter with `in (..., null)` against V2 source table. `DataSourceStrategy` caches the mapping (filter instance -> expression) in HashMap, which leverages hash code on the key, hence it could trigger the NPE issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is an obvious bug as `In` filter doesn't care about null value when calculating hash code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, previously the query with having `null` in \"in\" condition against data source V2 source table supporting push down filter failed with NPE, whereas after the PR the query will not fail.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT added. The new UT fails without the PR and passes with the PR.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-28T12:28:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T19:23:10Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T17:01:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87e3448c27ba07dbd1f830ad600e6e7f6d14f9d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aae3e0ccc426282463860c2e2a76bbe5860f572d","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-33267","ref":"SPARK-33267","sha":"aae3e0ccc426282463860c2e2a76bbe5860f572d","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

A sequence of queries to reproduce this issue is as follows;\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import Row\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import col\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>> from pyspark.testing.sqlutils import *\r\n>>> \r\n>>> row = Row(point=ExamplePoint(1.0, 2.0))\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([row])\r\n>>> df.select(col(\"point\").cast(PythonOnlyUDT()))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 1402, in select\r\n    jdf = self._jdf.select(self._jcols(*cols))\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1305, in __call__\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 111, in deco\r\n    return f(*a, **kw)\r\n  File \"/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9-src.zip/py4j/protocol.py\", line 328, in get_return_value\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o44.select.\r\n: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.UserDefinedType.acceptsType(UserDefinedType.scala:84)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Cast$.canCast(Cast.scala:96)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CastBase.checkInputDataTypes(Cast.scala:267)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CastBase.resolved$lzycompute(Cast.scala:290)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CastBase.resolved(Cast.scala:290)\r\n```\r\nA root cause of this issue is that, since `PythonUserDefinedType#userClassis` always null, `isAssignableFrom` in `UserDefinedType#acceptsType` throws a null exception. To fix it, this PR defines  `acceptsType` in `PythonUserDefinedType` and filters out the null case in `UserDefinedType#acceptsType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to change the behavior on failing fast when Spark fails to instantiate configured v2 session catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe Spark behavior is against the intention of the end users - if end users configure session catalog which Spark would fail to initialize, Spark would swallow the error with only logging the error message and silently use the default catalog implementation.\r\n\r\nThis follows the voices on [discussion thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdfa22a5ebdc4ac66e2c5c8ff0cd9d750e8a1690cd6fb456d119c2400%40%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E) in dev mailing list.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. After the PR Spark will fail immediately if Spark fails to instantiate configured session catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added.","created_at":"2020-10-28T04:50:51Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T00:43:50Z","closed_at":"2021-02-12T00:43:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aad1ca686e1eecb40706caa7d38055c4f2b40873","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6550d07f201e4f23cdc40e049aa7f550eabdf2b","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-33240-branch-3.0","ref":"SPARK-33240-branch-3.0","sha":"f6550d07f201e4f23cdc40e049aa7f550eabdf2b","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDriver side changes for coordinating push based shuffle by selecting external shuffle services for merging partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes changes related to `ShuffleMapStage` preparation which is selection of merger locations and initializing them as part of `ShuffleDependency`. \r\n\r\nCurrently this code is not used as some of the changes would come subsequently as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32917 (shuffle blocks push as part of `ShuffleMapTask`), https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32918 (support for finalize API) and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32920 (finalization of push/merge phase). This is why the tests here are also partial, once these above mentioned changes are raised as PR we will have enough tests for DAGScheduler piece of code as well.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdded a new API in `SchedulerBackend` to get merger locations for push based shuffle. This is currently implemented for Yarn and other cluster managers can have separate implementations which is why a new API is introduced.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, user facing config to enable push based shuffle is introduced\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests partially and some of the changes in DAGScheduler depends on future changes, DAGScheduler tests will be added along with those changes. \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is one of the patches for SPIP SPARK-30602 which is needed for push-based shuffle.\r\nSummary of changes:\r\nThis PR introduces a new RPC to be called within Driver. When the expected shuffle push wait time reaches, Driver will call this RPC to facilitate coordination of shuffle map/reduce stages and notify external shuffle services to finalize shuffle block merge for a given shuffle. Shuffle services also respond back the metadata about a merged shuffle partition back to the caller.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefer to the SPIP in SPARK-30602.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis code snippets won't be called by any existing code and will be tested after the coordinated driver changes gets merged in SPARK-32920.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Min Shen

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to make StateStore compression codec configurable. This config value, like other streaming e.g. `spark.sql.streaming.join.stateFormatVersion`, is important to streaming query execution. It is persisted with other streaming configs into the offset log in the checkpoint position. For previous checkpoint without this config, previous \"lz4\" codec is used as default coded to make sure backward-compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the compression codec of StateStore is not configurable and hard-coded to be lz4. It is better if we can follow Spark other modules to configure the compression codec of StateStore. For example, we can choose zstd codec and zstd is configurable with different compression level.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this change users can config different codec for StateStore.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2020-10-27T21:28:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:42Z","closed_at":"2020-10-29T14:44:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3ab83fef05d41ca52f1f14ee2b9cd654fd6ab74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4dc153db5eeea904e0c2208726cbd41bd514b62f","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-33263","ref":"SPARK-33263","sha":"4dc153db5eeea904e0c2208726cbd41bd514b62f","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the Spark SQL null semantics states that \"NULL AND False\" yields NULL.  This is incorrect.  \"NULL AND False\" yields False.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSeq[(java.lang.Boolean, java.lang.Boolean)](\r\n  (null, false)\r\n)\r\n  .toDF(\"left_operand\", \"right_operand\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"AND\", 'left_operand && 'right_operand)\r\n  .show(truncate = false)\r\n\r\n+------------+-------------+-----+\r\n|left_operand|right_operand|AND  |\r\n+------------+-------------+-----+\r\n|null        |false        |false|\r\n+------------+-------------+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose the documentation be updated to reflect that \"NULL AND False\" yields False.\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and I license it to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change improves the accuracy of the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.  This PR introduces a fix to the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nSince this is only a documentation change, no tests were added.","created_at":"2020-10-27T15:12:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T23:42:38Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T23:36:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68492e03545d73e15cd03ac8fd50be446e519347","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1359a8223699e989ae858d2d915617ea28e8f0b9","head":{"label":"stwhit:SPARK-33246","ref":"SPARK-33246","sha":"1359a8223699e989ae858d2d915617ea28e8f0b9","user":{"login":"stwhit","id":15616269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjE2MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15616269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit","html_url":"https://github.com/stwhit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":307721662,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDc3MjE2NjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"stwhit/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stwhit","id":15616269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjE2MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15616269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit","html_url":"https://github.com/stwhit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stwhit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stwhit/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe following query produces incorrect results. The query has two essential features: (1) it contains a string aggregate, resulting in a `SortExec` node, and (2) it contains a duplicate grouping key, causing `RemoveRepetitionFromGroupExpressions` to produce a sort order stored as a `Stream`.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT bigint_col_1, bigint_col_9, MAX(CAST(bigint_col_1 AS string))\r\nFROM table_4\r\nGROUP BY bigint_col_1, bigint_col_9, bigint_col_9\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the sort order is stored as a `Stream`, the line `ordering.map(_.child.genCode(ctx))` in `GenerateOrdering#createOrderKeys()` produces unpredictable side effects to `ctx`. This is because `genCode(ctx)` modifies `ctx`. When `ordering` is a `Stream`, the modifications will not happen immediately as intended, but will instead occur lazily when the returned `Stream` is used later.\r\n\r\nSimilar bugs have occurred at least three times in the past: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24500, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25767, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26680.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to call `.toIndexedSeq` on `ordering` before applying the modifications. This causes the modifications to occur eagerly rather than lazily.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test for `SortExec` where `sortOrder` is a `Stream`. The test previously failed and now passes.","created_at":"2020-10-27T11:29:19Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T23:55:08Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T20:20:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6a513fde1a57adb7a5509aee0aba8d575e961b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e98ecc55390b0fdd5d310c57785658b68ae9ee5e","head":{"label":"ankurdave:SPARK-33260","ref":"SPARK-33260","sha":"e98ecc55390b0fdd5d310c57785658b68ae9ee5e","user":{"login":"ankurdave","id":408432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODQzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave","html_url":"https://github.com/ankurdave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18090820,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA5MDgyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"ankurdave/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ankurdave","id":408432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODQzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave","html_url":"https://github.com/ankurdave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ankurdave/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Add an interface called `AppLiveStatusPlugin` for live application to create extra listeners that can write a given store.\r\n- Add a configuration called `spark.appLiveStatusPlugins`, to specify what `AppLiveStatusPlugin` should be loaded.\r\n- In SparkContext, load `AppLiveStatusPlugin` using `Utils.loadExtensions`, then create and register listeners.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are cases that developers may want to extend the current REST API of Web UI. In most of these cases, adding external module is a better option than directly editing the original Spark code.\r\n\r\nFor an external module, to extend the REST API of the Web UI, 2 things may need to be done:\r\n * Add extra API to provide extra status info. This can be simply done by implementing another `ApiRequestContext` which will be automatically loaded.\r\n * If the info can not be calculated from the original data in the store, add extra listeners to generate them.\r\n\r\nFor history server, there is an interface called `AppHistoryServerPlugin`, which is loaded based on SPI, providing a method to create listeners. In live application, the only way is `spark.extraListeners` based on `Utils.loadExtensions`. But this is not enough for the cases.\r\n\r\nTo let the API get the status info, the data need to be written to the `AppStatusStore`, which is the only store that an API can get by accessing `ui.store` or `ui.sc.statusStore`. But listeners created by `Utils.loadExtensions` only get a `SparkConf` in construction, and are unable to write the `AppStatusStore`.\r\n\r\nSo I think we still need plugin like `AppHistorySever` for live UI. For concerns like [SPARK-22786](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19981), the plugin for live app can be separated from the history server one, and also loaded using Utils.loadExtensions with an extra configurations. So by default, nothing will be loaded.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, a new configuration property called `spark.appLiveStatusPlugins`, indicating all `AppLiveStatusPlugin` to load.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested using existed UT.\r\n\r\nAlso add tests for `AppLiveStatusPlugin` to make sure plugins in `spark.appLiveStatusPlugins` will be loaded and listeners will be created and registered.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-27T08:31:55Z","updated_at":"2021-02-06T00:42:53Z","closed_at":"2021-02-06T00:42:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdacb526ca144023582dc9c7729f593f7ee5593a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ee60f4917d8f96f4aefedfb37fedec29ba1435e","head":{"label":"kuwii:add-plugin-for-live-app","ref":"add-plugin-for-live-app","sha":"8ee60f4917d8f96f4aefedfb37fedec29ba1435e","user":{"login":"kuwii","id":10705175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzA1MTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10705175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii","html_url":"https://github.com/kuwii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuwii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4b0e23e646b579b852056ffc87164b16adef5a09","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake pod allocation executor timeouts configurable. Keep all known pods in mind when allocating executors to avoid over-allocating if the pending time is much higher than the allocation interval.\r\n\r\nThis PR increases the default wait time to 600s from the current 60s.\r\n\r\nSince nodes can now remain \"pending\" for long periods of time, we allow additional batches to be scheduled during pending allocation but keep the total number of pods in account.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current executor timeouts do not match that of all real world clusters especially under load. While this can be worked around by increasing the allocation batch delay, that will decrease the speed at which the total number of executors will be able to be requested.\r\n\r\nThe increase in default timeout is needed to handle real-world testing environments I've encountered on moderately busy clusters and K8s clusters with their own underlying dynamic scale-up of hardware (e.g. GKE, EKS, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes new configuration property\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing test to use the timeout from the new configuration property. Verified test failed without the update.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-26T23:02:41Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T18:54:44Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T18:54:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0745a85887701eba239753d0fd41982788a82be6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90ad4d140a80df379384f81ffbbdfec758eb1b39","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-33231-make-pod-creation-timeout-configurable","ref":"SPARK-33231-make-pod-creation-timeout-configurable","sha":"90ad4d140a80df379384f81ffbbdfec758eb1b39","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to initiate the migration to NumPy documentation style (from reST style) in PySpark docstrings.\r\nThis PR also adds one migration example of `SparkContext`.\r\n\r\n- **Before:**\r\n    ...\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 7 02 05

are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for switching to NumPy documentation style.\r\n\r\n1. Arguably reST style doesn't fit well when the docstring grows large because it provides (arguably) less structures and syntax.\r\n\r\n2. NumPy documentation style provides a better human readable docstring format. For example, notebook users often just do `help(...)` by `pydoc`.\r\n\r\n3. NumPy documentation style is pretty commonly used in data science libraries, for example, pandas, numpy, Dask, Koalas, \r\nmatplotlib, ... Using NumPy documentation style can give users a consistent documentation style.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe dependency itself doesn't change anything user-facing.\r\nThe documentation change in `SparkContext` does, as shown above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via running `cd python` and `make clean html`.","created_at":"2020-10-26T10:45:36Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:30Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T05:04:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"861b537baf2489286ea64db62d45a94021acf452","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/89801caa82298b0f4f7be5a620b2ae0ae58b8089","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33243","ref":"SPARK-33243","sha":"89801caa82298b0f4f7be5a620b2ae0ae58b8089","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Call `spark.read.table` in `spark.table`.\r\n- Add comments for `spark.table` to emphasize it also support streaming temp view reading.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe code paths of `spark.table` and `spark.read.table` should be the same. This behavior is broke in SPARK-32592 since we need to respect options in `spark.read.table` API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to change the behavior on failing fast when Spark fails to instantiate configured v2 session catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe Spark behavior is against the intention of the end users - if end users configure session catalog which Spark would fail to initialize, Spark would swallow the error with only logging the error message and silently use the default catalog implementation.\r\n\r\nThis follows the voices on [discussion thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdfa22a5ebdc4ac66e2c5c8ff0cd9d750e8a1690cd6fb456d119c2400%40%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E) in dev mailing list.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. After the PR Spark will fail immediately if Spark fails to instantiate configured session catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added.","created_at":"2020-10-26T06:29:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T05:54:11Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T03:31:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17d98ed028cf9563ea9c6be6cbf24d97f471d8f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d50c6911c76ff62286c3bef571d5a488b1f7b5ec","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-33240","ref":"SPARK-33240","sha":"d50c6911c76ff62286c3bef571d5a488b1f7b5ec","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror
