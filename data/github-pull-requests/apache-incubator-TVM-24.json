Motivation\r\nThe gelu operator has different implementations, in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html), they are distinguished by `approximate='none'` or `approximate='tanh'`. Currently, Relax only implements the case where `approximate=\"none\"`  which depends on erf function, this PR implements the gelu operator approximated by tanh. In hugging face transformers, the gelu with tanh operator is called [gelu_new](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/366a8ca09e8dd92dfb1956c8be3118b5a2b13639/src/transformers/activations.py#L49) and was used in many models.\r\n\r\n## Difference with erf gelu\r\nActually, I only observed a very slight numerical difference between the two implementations, so I'm still not sure whether it necessary to include this variant or not.\r\n\r\nBelow is a figure showing the numerical difference between the two, and the script:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/tvm/assets/11773619/e002b8a5-9e0a-49ed-9e61-eebdfb7c0eba)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport torch\r\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nx = np.linspace(-6, 6, 200)\r\nx = torch.from_numpy(x).float()\r\ny_none = F.gelu(x, approximate='none')\r\ny_tanh = F.gelu(x, approximate='tanh')\r\nplt.plot(x.numpy(), (y_tanh - y_none).numpy(), label='difference')\r\nplt.legend()\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe largest difference is

discussed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14723, some cutlass kernels, in particular the attention kernel, require temporary storage to hold intermediate results. This results in repeated calls to cudaMalloc/Free, and the bug like #14723. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a pass that allocate a big workspace at the beginning of `main` and threads that through all functions that need temp storage. This lets us eliminate all redundant malloc / free, and improves e2e perf slightly. \r\n\r\nAn external function can specify its workspace requirement by the `kWorkspaceSize` attribute. See how it is done for the cutlass attention kernel for example. \r\n\r\n@vinx13 @cyx-6 @yelite

discussed in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/99803, as of PT 1.13, PT started to fill in a stride with 1 whenever the corresponding shape axis has size 1 during PT tensor to DLPack conversion. This breaks `tvm.runtime.ndarray.from_dlpack` when the shape is like `(1, 77)` (clip for SD) or whenever the batch size is 1 in vision models. So this is going to be a common problem that people would encounter in practice (see https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/a-pytorch-and-tvm-version-incompatibility-problem-while-using-from-dlpack-and-to-dlpack/14771).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by relaxing the runtime stride check. An alternative is to modify the strides during `from_dlpack`, but since PT introduced this change for a good reason, I felt that trying to calculate the \"correct\" strides on our side again is not a good idea.   \r\n\r\n@tqchen @junrushao \r\n

is the first step toward supporting Intel XMX (tensorcore equivalent of Intel dGPUs). They expose XMX via spirv, and such spirv modules can be consumed by their OpenCL runtime.  It is going to be a long game, since [their extension](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/design/spirv-extensions/SPV_INTEL_joint_matrix.asciidoc) is not even in the spirv toolchain yet. I have the simplest test case of XMX tensorization (m8n8k16 matmul) working using [this script](https://github.com/masahi/tensorir-experiment/blob/master/spirv-opencl/joint_matrix.py) but beyond that I've been struggling with strange correctness issues (see https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/issues/279).\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm abusing the existing `-device` target option to decide when to enable spirv code gen for the opencl target (`target = \"opencl -device=spirv\"`). I don't have a strong opinion on this, suggestions welcome. \r\n\r\nThe next steps are going to be\r\n* Update our spirv codegen to support emitting the OpenCL flavor (\"Kernel\" capability, https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Env.html)\r\n* Support Intel joint matrix extension in our spirv codegen. It's very similar to the NV tensorcore extension https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14770\r\n\r\n@echuraev @tqchen @csullivan

to this commit, any use of `tvm.nd.from_dlpack` to create a strided `NDArray`, or a `NDArray` whose alignment was less than `tvm::runtime::kAllocAlignment` would raise an error.  As a result, views into larger arrays, which are unlikely to be aligned and compact, could only be shared when copied into an aligned and compact buffer.\r\n\r\nThis commit moves the compact/aligned check from the `NDArray` class into the generated TIR code as part of DLTensor unpacking.  These checks were initially introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11391, to avoid segfaults caused by use of non-aligned buffers in code intended for aligned buffers.  The new checks will provide the same safeguard as the alignment is checked prior to use, but allows the alignment requirement to be relaxed on a per-buffer basis.\r\n\r\nThis approach also removes a potential bug resulting from compile-time configuration of `tvm::runtime::kAllocAlignment`, first introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13307.  Since TVM supports cross-compiling, the installation of TVM used to compile a kernel may assume a larger value of `kAllocAlignment` than is provided by the runtime installation of TVM.  By validating the alignment within the generated kernel, rather than as part of the runtime, this potential inconsistency would be caught.","created_at":"2023-05-04T21:15:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T15:54:06Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T15:54:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65fbd6017dd6511d51cc66c005c453e9b85d15d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b265574be1232379daba02fb4ec0d8e6ede4f058","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:move_alignment_compact_checks_to_tir","ref":"move_alignment_compact_checks_to_tir","sha":"b265574be1232379daba02fb4ec0d8e6ede4f058","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR enables using tensorcore on vulkan target for NV devices. The semantics of the instructions are pretty much the same as WMMA. See https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Registry/blob/master/extensions/NV/SPV_NV_cooperative_matrix.html for the reference.\r\n\r\nThe script https://github.com/masahi/tensorir-experiment/blob/master/vk_cooperative_matrix_nv/test_4k.py shows the usage of this extension in a realistic matmul schedule. It gets 36 TFLOPs for f16f16f32 matmul on RTX 3070 (peak being 41 TFLOPs). It also demonstrates AutoTVM-style MS tuning for tiling parameters.  \r\n\r\nContrary to our WMMA support, which relies on [a complicated \"fragment index\" concept](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/tir/tensor_intrin/cuda.py#L550-L556) and generating an \"array\" of fragment and indexing them in the source code (not possible with SPIRV), my solution materializes all cooperative matrices in the codegen and explicitly unroll all instructions on them. Each matrix is identified by an element offset into the buffer with cooperative matrix scope, so an element offset is required to be a constant. I'm not sure if that is a reasonable assumption, but other than that I believe my solution is better than how we are supporting WMMA for CUDA. See `codegen_spirv.cc` for details.  \r\n\r\n@tqchen @Lunderberg @vinx13 @spectrometerHBH

patch fixes a bug in ELU. when the alpha=None, It will lead to a wrong compilation and give a confusing inference result.\r\nFor example, the following script will produce inconsistent inference results between TVM and Keras. However, we hope tvm can reject it immediately in the model loading stage.

PR expands the support of attention bias layout. In the past, we only support 3 types of layout, with `BNSS'`, `BSS'`, `BS'`, e.g. `BNSS'` for (batch_size, num_head, seq_len, seq_len_kv).  However, cutlass accepts 8 types of layout, as long as the shape ends with `S` and is broadcastable to `BNSS'`. So in this PR, we fixed the ndim of `bias` to 4 and accepts all 8 types of layout as cutlass.","created_at":"2023-04-28T05:49:55Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T12:11:37Z","closed_at":"2023-04-28T12:11:37Z","merged_at":"2023-04-28T12:11:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd02791e5a18715997ef68ff1d755770b6bee63f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c6778c94fd2d8d926571596385e76d658297635c","head":{"label":"cyx-6:attn-bias","ref":"attn-bias","sha":"c6778c94fd2d8d926571596385e76d658297635c","user":{"login":"cyx-6","id":16838183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6","html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444563899,"node_id":"R_kgDOGn-Buw","name":"tvm","full_name":"cyx-6/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cyx-6","id":16838183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6","html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6/tvm","description":"Open

However, in the [source code comments](https://github.com/jikechao/tvm/blob/main_abc/python/tvm/relay/frontend/keras.py#:~:text=layout%3A%20str,better%20across%20TVM.) and [official documentation](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/reference/api/python/relay/frontend.html?highlight=from_keras#tvm.relay.frontend.from_keras:~:text=layout%20(str)%20%E2%80%93%20One%20of%20%E2%80%98NCHW%E2%80%99%20or%20%E2%80%98NHWC%E2%80%99%2C%20indicates%20how%20data%20should%20be%20arranged%20in%20the%20output%20model.%20Default%20layout%20is%20%E2%80%98NCHW%E2%80%99%20as%20it%20in%20general%20performs%20better%20across%20TVM.) , it says only 'nchw' and 'nhwc' are supported. They are conflicted. \r\n\r\n2. Add exception checking to reject the mismatched `layout` and `input_shape` immediately.\r\n    For the following script: relay can convert the keras model to RelayIR successful, It crashed when executed the last statements **(e.g., `model = model.evaluate()`) in the script and throw:   \"Check failed: (!axes.defined() || static_cast<int>(axes.size()) == ndim) is false: Dimension mismatch: axes has 4 elements, but data.ndim = 3\".**  This exception checking is too late, and the crash message will increase the difficulty of debugging. Thus, I added an exception checking in keras importer and give a more clear exception message.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport tvm.relay as relay\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom tensorflow import keras\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers, models\r\n\r\n\r\ninput_shape = (1, 2, 3)   \r\n# the dimesion=3 and the default layout = 'nchw' which constructs an invalid test case \r\n# but it passes the frontend check and generates a RealyIR.\r\ninput_data = np.random.random(input_shape)\r\nx = layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:], dtype='float32')  \r\n\r\nlayer = keras.layers.Flatten()\r\nlayer.set_weights(layer.get_weights())\r\n\r\ny = layer(x)\r\nmodel = models.Model(x, y)\r\n\r\nshape_dict = {'input_1': input_shape}\r\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_keras(model, shape_dict)    # convert to RelayIR successfully.\r\nprint(mod)\r\n\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):\r\n    model = relay.build_module.create_executor(\"vm\", mod, tvm.cpu(0), 'llvm', params)\r\n    model = model.evaluate()    # crash here!!!\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\ncc

on a [comment](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/issues/57#issuecomment-1518639252) from @tqchen I've gone ahead and made a PR for my [suggestion/question](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/issues/57) of caching `ndarray-cache.json` before caching the shards. From my point of view this change means subsequent loads will pull 100% from CacheStorage, avoiding any external requests. Also I think this might make more sense because if your `ndarrayCacheUrl` is not pinned to a specific commit then it could perhaps become out of sync with the cached shards.","created_at":"2023-04-26T05:14:39Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T13:47:13Z","closed_at":"2023-04-26T13:47:07Z","merged_at":"2023-04-26T13:47:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"84e286be7194456d7d4f2d384f790e9f731b5da3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/09196b24d9e696d014093a594e0c5396b5feb794","head":{"label":"DustinBrett:unity","ref":"unity","sha":"09196b24d9e696d014093a594e0c5396b5feb794","user":{"login":"DustinBrett","id":16656318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU2MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16656318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett","html_url":"https://github.com/DustinBrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":632766605,"node_id":"R_kgDOJbdAjQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"DustinBrett/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DustinBrett","id":16656318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU2MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16656318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett","html_url":"https://github.com/DustinBrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DustinBrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DustinBrett/tvm","description":"Open

a user doesn't want to bind params at compile time and still benefit from AMP, it is important that these params are provided at runtime as fp16 tensors. Otherwise the conservative nature of AMP kicks in and we end up with lots of cast to fp32 before bias add etc. Also when the same model is executed many times with runtime weights (e.g. SD UNet), we would end up casting input fp32 weights repeatedly in the inference loop.\r\n\r\nTo allow ingesting fp16 tensors as input, this PR lets users provide a list of parameter names whose dtype should become fp16 at runtime.\r\n\r\ncc @spectrometerHBH
