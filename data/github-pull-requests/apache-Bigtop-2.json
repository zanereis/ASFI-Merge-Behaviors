However, Spark 3.3 uses Maven Shade Plugin version 3.2.4, which triggers an infinite loop bug during parallel compilation. You can find more details about this issue at [MSHADE-413](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-413).\r\n\r\nA PR has been submitted for Spark 3.3 to upgrade the Maven Shade Plugin to version 3.5.0. This upgrade has already been applied in Spark 3.5, [SPARK-44257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44257).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR includes the upgrade of the mvn-shade-plugin as part of [SPARK-44257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44257). It's worth noting that [SPARK-44257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44257) contains some code that doesn't exist in Spark 3.3 and has been ignored.\r\n\r\ndepend on [BIGTOP-4044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-4044)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/0ef08aba-a83b-47ba-9c6c-86b9fadb4dc7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/How+to+Contribute\r\n    2. Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nIn the minimal Python code of phoenix 5.1.3, there is a handling for Python that allows it to support both Python 3 and Python 2. Therefore, a dependency on Python 3 is added in the Phoenix deb package because many systems only have Python 3 by default. Not adding this dependency would result in users being unable to install Phoenix properly.\r\n\r\nThe code related to Python 3 compatibility can be found at:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/phoenix/blob/5.1.3/bin/daemon.py#L66\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638. Your PR title ...')?\r\n- [ ] Make sure that newly added files do not have any licensing issues.

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/How+to+Contribute\r\n    2. Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nSpark 3.3 itself does support parallel compilation. However, Spark 3.3 uses Maven Shade Plugin version 3.2.4, which triggers an infinite loop bug during parallel compilation. You can find more details about this issue at [MSHADE-413](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-413).\r\n\r\nA PR has been submitted for Spark 3.3 to upgrade the Maven Shade Plugin to version 3.5.0. This upgrade has already been applied in Spark 3.5,  [SPARK-44257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44257).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR primarily introduces the Maven patch and also includes the upgrade of the mvn-shade-plugin as part of [SPARK-44257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44257). It's worth noting that [SPARK-44257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44257) contains some code that doesn't exist in Spark 3.3 and has been ignored.\r\n\r\n**depend on [BIGTOP-4044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-4044). Therefore, when testing [BIGTOP-4046](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-4046) , it's necessary to include [BIGTOP-4044]**(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-4044) in the merge as well.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/33ab9f81-0733-494b-8d64-f01002b25ec7)\r\n./gradlew spark-clean spark-pkg -PcompileThreads=2C\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/How+to+Contribute\r\n    2. Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nBackground:\r\nWithin the components maintained by Bigtop, a significant portion is built using Java and relies on Maven as the build tool.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nCompiling components that consist of numerous modules can be a time-consuming process. For instance, some components contain hundreds of modules, and compiling them one by one consumes a substantial amount of time. Even when all dependencies are pre-downloaded for a second compilation, the process remains slow due to the sequential nature of compilation. Additionally, compiling all components together still results in sequential compilation, making it challenging to fully leverage CPU resources and reduce compilation time significantly. Consequently, repetitive compilation and testing phases impose prolonged waiting periods.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI propose the introduction of a new parameter that allows users to toggle parallel compilation for components built using Maven, thus empowering them to align compilation practices with their specific needs.\r\n\r\nRelated Pull Requests (PRs):\r\nThis discussion can be divided into two main parts:\r\n\r\nThe first part entails adding parallel compilation functionality and enabling it for components that have undergone testing without encountering additional issues related to parallel compilation. **These components include Hive, HBase, Flink, ZooKeeper, Alluxio, Phoenix, Livy, Zeppelin**\r\n\r\nThe second part involves enabling parallel compilation for components that face challenges with parallel compilation and necessitate additional patches to address Maven's parallel compilation capabilities. These components include **Ranger, Tez, Hadoop, Spark**\r\n\r\n\r\nCompilation Environment: CentOS 7 x86_64, 16C, SSD\r\n\r\n**The following table shows the time comparison for repeated compilations, where dependencies are already downloaded, before and after using parallel compilation.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, there is an overall performance improvement of about 2-3 times. If it's the first compilation, given the massive dependencies that need to be downloaded, the advantage of parallel compilation becomes even more apparent. For example, the first compilation of Hadoop 3 was reduced from nearly 3 hours to about 1 hour.**\r\n\r\n| Component | Time Before | Time After |\r\n|-----------|-------------|------------|\r\n| Alluxio   | 21min       | 07:43min   |\r\n| Hive      | 05:33min    | 03:04min   |\r\n| HBase     | 06:18min    | 02:55min   |\r\n| Zookeeper | 01:25min    | 35s        |\r\n| Livy      | 03:29min    | 03:12min   |\r\n| Phoenix   | 05:32min    | 11:23min   |\r\n| Zeppelin  | 14:15min    | 13:19min   |\r\n| Flink     | 14:16min    | 36:27min   |\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\ntest compile apache hbase in parallel on ubuntu22 x8664\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/fd2a541b-9688-4256-a783-a15e0d2bc83c)\r\n\r\ntest hive on centos7 x86_64\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/b73b54ad-787f-4031-bb5d-1def63faae5e)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn CentOS 7 x86_64, the parallel compilation speed of Alluxio is one-third of the non-parallel compilation speed, taking only 7 minutes.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/406a0613-8a4f-4ae1-ac14-2ad9a6862c66)\r\n\r\n\r\n phoenix  centos7 x86_64\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/519605e7-dfc3-4dd2-94e0-58de0ca71492)\r\n\r\nlivy centos7 x86_64\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/f621b743-2ccc-4760-a1d4-a2a9861beb69)\r\n\r\nzeppelin on  centos7 x86_64 \r\n \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/322b4f9e-8a69-41fa-81a9-a763d38f994a)\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

The command update-alternatives --install /etc/ranger/conf ranger-conf @etc_ranger@/conf.dist 30 was updated. The soft link directory under /etc should correspond to the component's directory, such as /etc/ranger-admin/conf.\r\n\r\n2.Added JDBC dependency. When executing the setup.sh script under Ubuntu 22, an error was reported about missing JDBC driver. This was resolved by installing libpostgresql-jdbc-java.\r\n\r\n3.Also, a solution was provided for the lack of /var/log/ranger directory when starting Ranger\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/59b7c425-3824-48a8-9517-07f867644311)\r\n\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

In addition, dynamic generation is quite convenient for subsequent customization of the installation directory and package name. For deb packaging, the development of adding -PpkgSuffix and -PparentDir  to most bigdata components  has been completed and is currently under testing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/67ad03df-5ef3-4c72-93a2-4750c9a1b962)\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

However, some components that were added later did not include dh_strip_nondeterminism:, resulting in slow packaging times, such as with Flink.\r\n\r\nThe role of dh_strip_nondeterminism is to remove non-deterministic elements from the build process. This ensures that the package building process is reproducible. If you know that your build process is already deterministic, you can choose to skip this step.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

I think bumping ZooKeeper from 3.5 to 3.6 is good as intermediate step to upgrade to 3.7 or later and good candidate to merge into branch-3.2 (i.e. Bigtop 3.2.2) too.\r\n\r\nI built zookeeper-pkg and ran smoke-tests of zookeeper this on Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64) and Rocky Linux 8 (aarch64).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./docker-hadoop.sh \\\r\n    --create 1 \\\r\n    --image bigtop/puppet:trunk-ubuntu-22.04

If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/How+to+Contribute\r\n    2. Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nWhen using YARN Timeline Service v2, you need to configure the following property in yarn-site:\r\nyarn.timeline-service.hbase.coprocessor.jar.hdfs.location\r\nhadoop-yarn-server-timelineservice-hbase-coprocessor-3.3.5.jar\r\nThis binding to version 3.3.5 can complicate automated configuration and installation. Similar to other components that depend on ZooKeeper's jar, symbolic links are often created to handle version dependencies, generating zookeeper.jar. Both Ambari HDP and Bigtop stacks utilize similar code for configuring this property, making it easier to automatically populate the configuration without needing to consider the specific Hadoop version.\r\n\r\ndetails see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3985\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\nafter apply this patch and rebuild hadoop rpm, yarn ui2 show logs normally with ambari bigtop stack\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/ad212784-47f0-4dbc-b4fa-d8aa748a0ba7)\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

Description of PR\r\nhadoop 3.3.5 has upgraded its jackson dependency and removed all jackson 1.x packages, including the jackson-jaxrs jar. As a result, when starting with the Ranger plugin enabled, Hadoop namenode fails to start due to the ranger plugin inability to load jackson 1.x.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue and ensure compatibility with the Hadoop 3.3.5 upgrade, we need to package jackson 1.x jars in the hdfs plugin as well, like the Ozone did https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-2818. This will allow the namenode to start successfully.\r\n\r\nlook this issue for more details:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3965\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/db5f464f-45ac-4a67-a958-4426bdce04c8)\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

When the TimelineServiceReader starts and attempts to create an HBase table, it encounters compatibility issues between HBase 1 and 2 APIs, resulting in the failure to find the required method and thus unable to create the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nsee more details in  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3961\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\nafter fixed yarn timeline service v2  working normally \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/79b6f188-419d-412d-8e68-02f0058c2adb)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/fc5cd0c5-dad6-4985-a293-b27ebf1ebe54)\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.
