and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-15T06:42:04Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:02:51Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T08:04:42Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T08:04:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"51529c34c584e51f3ebaa07d8dc3953457a85522","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55/labels","id":8204251,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfS_b","number":55,"title":"3.0.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-16T08:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T02:57:41Z","due_on":"2022-08-16T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ade1d9010d48aa24112cc9de0794ba1cbd85167a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0815_trans","ref":"0815_trans","sha":"ade1d9010d48aa24112cc9de0794ba1cbd85167a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-15T03:51:47Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T06:44:45Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T06:44:45Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T06:44:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"cac475008cf42ccc7c916bbd9525870de9b650bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6be23f49551078edaf41615d4a9acabb422ecdf9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0815_remove","ref":"0815_remove","sha":"6be23f49551078edaf41615d4a9acabb422ecdf9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

。\r\n\r\n但因为两个routerChain里面的`TagStateRouter、ServiceStateRouter、AppStateRouter`都是一个对象引用（因为他们的SPI工厂都用了缓存），所以两个routerChain各自添加这三个router的时候，只注册了一次监听器(主要是ServiceStateRouter和AppStateRouter)，即调用了一次`doAddListener`方法；而两个routerChain各自销毁的时候对这三个router重复调用了各自的`router.stop()`方法，即调用两次`doRemoveListener`方法，第二次没有判空引发NPE。","created_at":"2022-08-14T15:59:05Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:02:51Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T01:45:35Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T01:45:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b095f1c68b546c9f0ce72dd91b9c1d2792c60be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55/labels","id":8204251,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfS_b","number":55,"title":"3.0.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-16T08:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T02:57:41Z","due_on":"2022-08-16T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/89a6d4df0831f629593753a1a6a42fbdc640240c","head":{"label":"BurningCN:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"89a6d4df0831f629593753a1a6a42fbdc640240c","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-14T03:58:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:02:51Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T01:44:51Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T01:44:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"438519cb71ec544fa87899f08222b761129646fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55/labels","id":8204251,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfS_b","number":55,"title":"3.0.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-16T08:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T02:57:41Z","due_on":"2022-08-16T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/aea4455bc3d9d09fbcb7c048c2f4429adfd6643a","head":{"label":"xiaomiusa87:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"aea4455bc3d9d09fbcb7c048c2f4429adfd6643a","user":{"login":"xiaomiusa87","id":72253502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjUzNTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72253502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaomiusa87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":524564204,"node_id":"R_kgDOH0Q27A","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xiaomiusa87/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaomiusa87","id":72253502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjUzNTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72253502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaomiusa87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaomiusa87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaomiusa87/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-13T16:01:39Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:08:36Z","closed_at":"2022-08-14T02:50:39Z","merged_at":"2022-08-14T02:50:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"29e4e4235b3dfdfdd4cd562bdc835bbd779634f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2cf6f4f7df631ab08cf1b8fcf156b46d52853c10","head":{"label":"liufeiyu1002:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"2cf6f4f7df631ab08cf1b8fcf156b46d52853c10","user":{"login":"liufeiyu1002","id":32605119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjA1MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32605119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002","html_url":"https://github.com/liufeiyu1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"56721482cab2c1396781672f018ebd50a478005d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/s

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-12T09:47:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T03:11:56Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T03:11:56Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T03:11:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"c84b745bb196f51cee304fa80c6821db9ea2d93d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/44e2fc7b67bd50607344c5e1b1dad177836bc9c2","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0812_fastjson","ref":"0812_fastjson","sha":"44e2fc7b67bd50607344c5e1b1dad177836bc9c2","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T07:32:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:08:35Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T01:56:13Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T01:56:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"c80b79174cd9f8621374728308b5cb87849d4caa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9c1fa46c0a11657cd556c49a4d4f221c4c634d37","head":{"label":"zhaoyunxing92:equals","ref":"equals","sha":"9c1fa46c0a11657cd556c49a4d4f221c4c634d37","user":{"login":"zhaoyunxing92","id":18088210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDg4MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18088210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaoyunxing92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaoyunxing92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"a0e2f715c2dee9b496715eaa8df70604b7d1b96f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T05:15:39Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:08:35Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T05:15:49Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T05:15:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0e2f715c2dee9b496715eaa8df70604b7d1b96f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/429be4d54028a4876a291d29f3917417f882651b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0809_fix_empty","ref":"0809_fix_empty","sha":"429be4d54028a4876a291d29f3917417f882651b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n为了解决issue列表中 https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/10402 的问题，该问题主要描述如下： \r\n\r\nAbstractRegistry.doSaveProperties()虽然采用文件锁、版本号以及重试等方式对竟争场景做了处理，但是在竟争文件锁失败创建重试任务时，没有sleep，仍会有概率出现上一个版本保存操作还没有释放锁，新版本重试次数达到上限导致新版本数据没有保存到cache文件的情况。\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n改动点主要是将默认共享线程池 SharedExecutor 换成了 SharedScheduleExecutor 以支持增加默认的延迟，避免快速重试导致上述问题出现。\r\n\r\n也考虑过通过实现类似Spring-Retry方式实现，但对于现有结构改动较大且收益不高，所以采用 ScheduleExecutor 方式改动\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-04T10:21:54Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:08:33Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T12:24:54Z","merged_at":"2022-08-04T12:24:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"beeca4a4ab10faeb0489b5e0eb6b881cc1afbe4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10406/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10406/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10406/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7993d0f922b781e3bf8a6c65495ead470042ad48","head":{"label":"JooKS-me:refactor/stream","ref":"refactor/stream","sha":"7993d0f922b781e3bf8a6c65495ead470042ad48","user":{"login":"JooKS-me","id":62384022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62384022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me","html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":413638411,"node_id":"R_kgDOGKefCw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"JooKS-me/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JooKS-me","id":62384022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62384022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me","html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-04T03:08:16Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:02:45Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T07:30:26Z","merged_at":"2022-08-04T07:30:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4052563b779ba0ee8a67eb717b4060698b6960a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/55","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/55/labels","id":8204251,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfS_b","number":55,"title":"3.0.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-16T08:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T02:57:41Z","due_on":"2022-08-16T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10404/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10404/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/605d01bfb882e135114b4770cf72449bd03fc46c","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0804_fix_acl","ref":"0804_fix_acl","sha":"605d01bfb882e135114b4770cf72449bd03fc46c","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T08:22:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T09:35:43Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T09:35:43Z","merged_at":"2022-08-02T09:35:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"d240c831de17ad105fe1efe9ea07ed97a82580bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10400/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10400/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10400/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8a28126cb1619b66d18a3c32818fb010a16f613f","head":{"label":"victory460:welcomeLogo","ref":"welcomeLogo","sha":"8a28126cb1619b66d18a3c32818fb010a16f613f","user":{"login":"victory460","id":30213558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30213558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460","html_url":"https://github.com/victory460","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":520371304,"node_id":"R_kgDOHwQ8aA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"victory460/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"victory460","id":30213558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30213558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460","html_url":"https://github.com/victory460","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victory460/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/victory460/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\n/cc @EarthChen

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T07:13:53Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T08:00:25Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T01:47:40Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T01:47:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d85688cc4e696cebe23218aa6b2703b59fd1ecf","assignee":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2854960f0e1b3491334a490e2ca22ce935f268ec","head":{"label":"TrueAbc:personal/trueabcV0.3","ref":"personal/trueabcV0.3","sha":"2854960f0e1b3491334a490e2ca22ce935f268ec","user":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-28T05:36:51Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:08:31Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T07:21:32Z","merged_at":"2022-07-28T07:21:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"5202f87ef01922163841138d283ebbfe5df130d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ac28d069077c607748d4afd9da1e0336267ce497","head":{"label":"EarthChen:remove-tri-compiler","ref":"remove-tri-compiler","sha":"ac28d069077c607748d4afd9da1e0336267ce497","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"f9eb28cf7ebb16e45c858c20982690b5a991a04d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T11:48:20Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T08:43:36Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T08:43:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71a250a7ca599a993340925cc6af728fcbd17fcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-26T07:09:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:08:30Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T03:04:24Z","merged_at":"2022-08-01T03:04:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"5482f3b68d47542a8d1fa08b28abc3bec5840f34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7da82f23c708ac0d1b0e55022133afb26baf1cdc","head":{"label":"chenyanlann:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"7da82f23c708ac0d1b0e55022133afb26baf1cdc","user":{"login":"chenyanlann","id":62465397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDY1Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62465397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann","html_url":"https://github.com/chenyanlann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515627975,"node_id":"R_kgDOHrvbxw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"chenyanlann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenyanlann","id":62465397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDY1Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62465397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann","html_url":"https://github.com/chenyanlann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyanlann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenyanlann/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-24T16:30:01Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T08:00:22Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T02:50:51Z","merged_at":"2022-08-01T02:50:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"63848bed74445ae0b931a32abc6be4d2965f9989","assignee":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/20ea27815c68b11857a47d58fa461e29647fa04b","head":{"label":"TrueAbc:personal/trueabcV0.2","ref":"personal/trueabcV0.2","sha":"20ea27815c68b11857a47d58fa461e29647fa04b","user":{"login":"TrueAbc","id":47651330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUxMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47651330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc","html_url":"https://github.com/TrueAbc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrueAbc/

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nApplicationConfig adds meshEnable configuration, ReferenceConfig adds providerPort configuration, and at the same time, api configuration, xml configuration, attribute configuration, and annotation configuration are modified.\r\n\r\nAfter meshEnable is true, the registry is set to N/A, at least one tri protocol needs to be configured, and the ports configured by the default consumer and provider are the same. DubboReference only needs to configure providedBy (K8S Service name == provider application name) to call.\r\n\r\n```properties\r\n# dubbo-consumer.properties\r\ndubbo.application.name=dubbo-samples-mesh-consumer\r\ndubbo.registry.address=N/A\r\ndubbo.protocol.name=tri\r\ndubbo.protocol.port=50052\r\n# enable mesh\r\ndubbo.application.meshEnable=true\r\n```\r\n```java\r\n// consumer\r\n@DubboReference(providedBy = \"dubbo-samples-mesh-provider\")\r\nprivate Greeter greeter;\r\n```\r\nIf the provider and consumer service ports are inconsistent, you need to configure the port exposed by the provider in DubboReference, as follows:\r\n```java\r\n// consumer\r\n@DubboReference(providedBy = \"dubbo-samples-mesh-provider\", providerPort = 50052)\r\nprivate Greeter greeter;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T08:02:35Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T13:39:33Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T13:39:25Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T13:39:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf11f298edfebf7405dd5fc850a22f3c13a99a07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7f131f29d0fa0cf7cd9a477bc932af34e3bd22a0","head":{"label":"conghuhu:thin-sdk","ref":"thin-sdk","sha":"7f131f29d0fa0cf7cd9a477bc932af34e3bd22a0","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"beeca4a4ab10faeb0489b5e0eb6b881cc1afbe4d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url"

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T03:27:30Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T03:27:39Z","closed_at":"2022-07-22T03:27:39Z","merged_at":"2022-07-22T03:27:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f06c8fae18257c2808da306d7340cc11fcd1df1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b4b743a1be542c25394574be4cdaf2db64ccf71c","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0722_patch_byte","ref":"0722_patch_byte","sha":"b4b743a1be542c25394574be4cdaf2db64ccf71c","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-21T09:06:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T03:02:56Z","closed_at":"2022-07-27T03:02:56Z","merged_at":"2022-07-27T03:02:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"904703eb2265baa3e210da815f9db3d5ea0e66d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2284fa6325b5e41c1f0184287ded218f47f1183f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0721_fix_throwable","ref":"0721_fix_throwable","sha":"2284fa6325b5e41c1f0184287ded218f47f1183f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-14T11:45:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:15Z","closed_at":"2022-07-14T13:08:01Z","merged_at":"2022-07-14T13:08:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5f864bb58621fb1c48ce0c3476a4a17d03c6a23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a786267fb1d19f6ee7dfda5b81386fb9e38ae315","head":{"label":"wangchengming666:fix-miss-file","ref":"fix-miss-file","sha":"a786267fb1d19f6ee7dfda5b81386fb9e38ae315","user":{"login":"wangchengming666","id":17539174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM5MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17539174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666","html_url":"https://github.com/wangchengming666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":509972590,"node_id":"R_kgDOHmWQbg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wangchengming666/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangchengming666","id":17539174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM5MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17539174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666","html_url":"https://github.com/wangchengming666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangchengming666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangchengming666/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-14T09:49:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:15Z","closed_at":"2022-07-19T02:55:02Z","merged_at":"2022-07-19T02:55:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"102357d1f0f8ec95ddcd06b3065bbd7bc3658839","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2325c9c56373f760f84a3cc91f47c1c63593dfe9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0714_sc","ref":"0714_sc","sha":"2325c9c56373f760f84a3cc91f47c1c63593dfe9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-12T08:58:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T04:51:45Z","closed_at":"2022-07-13T09:38:53Z","merged_at":"2022-07-13T09:38:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"edd245e5951f773550b5d23434554b35de0fb668","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/53","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53/labels","id":8079325,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ae0fd","number":53,"title":"3.0.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-14T08:56:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z","due_on":"2022-07-20T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c285644043de33094c141c5ad2be0256dc505bf8","head":{"label":"BurningCN:Optimize_code_and_add_some_ut_for_config-spring_module","ref":"Optimize_code_and_add_some_ut_for_config-spring_module","sha":"c285644043de33094c141c5ad2be0256dc505bf8","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-11T15:36:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-17T13:37:09Z","closed_at":"2022-07-12T03:17:43Z","merged_at":"2022-07-12T03:17:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8ee154a5c1192ba8c5aa915c8380f43a1e844fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/53","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53/labels","id":8079325,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ae0fd","number":53,"title":"3.0.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-14T08:56:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z","due_on":"2022-07-20T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/38c5ad242ebc8f803e87f83ceeeac53e94100bf3","head":{"label":"stonelion:inspect_code_remoting","ref":"inspect_code_remoting","sha":"38c5ad242ebc8f803e87f83ceeeac53e94100bf3","user":{"login":"stonelion","id":5867317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjczMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5867317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion","html_url":"https://github.com/stonelion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":323526753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM1MjY3NTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"stonelion/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stonelion","id":5867317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjczMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5867317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion","html_url":"https://github.com/stonelion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stonelion/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-11T08:46:52Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:31:49Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T08:46:57Z","merged_at":"2022-07-11T08:46:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0dc7924486760265f9fe57ad7080f6741cbb2c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/53","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53/labels","id":8079325,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ae0fd","number":53,"title":"3.0.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-14T08:56:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z","due_on":"2022-07-20T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/54b09231c716ce44b86f4c98d01a157630219c13","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0711_fix_modifier","ref":"0711_fix_modifier","sha":"54b09231c716ce44b86f4c98d01a157630219c13","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-11T02:49:45Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T09:10:12Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T07:16:23Z","merged_at":"2022-07-11T07:16:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"303cd6924f9a615a501989d58b6f3df4f21b242b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/53","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53/labels","id":8079325,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ae0fd","number":53,"title":"3.0.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-14T08:56:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z","due_on":"2022-07-20T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10299/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10299/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10299/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8398d79f72ded7d42dae9ac56b81b45cfb92c846","head":{"label":"happytimor:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"8398d79f72ded7d42dae9ac56b81b45cfb92c846","user":{"login":"happytimor","id":7302896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDI4OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7302896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor","html_url":"https://github.com/happytimor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/happytimor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"5f35f0dd183e09cc4f4b7456a651bcdc093247cf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-09T14:47:24Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:31:48Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T07:50:08Z","merged_at":"2022-07-11T07:50:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c1630186f1886c07c02729503069edf6665f17c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/53","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/53/labels","id":8079325,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ae0fd","number":53,"title":"3.0.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-06-14T08:56:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z","due_on":"2022-07-20T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-16T08:36:48Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/168917435b65e7e49a3cbfa0955d2e18a32adfb2","head":{"label":"EarthChen:fix-tri-server-stream","ref":"fix-tri-server-stream","sha":"168917435b65e7e49a3cbfa0955d2e18a32adfb2","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"92bf15dee23f2962937ba382d97193880a72fc40","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/us

What is the purpose of the change\r\n中文：\r\n\r\n为 #10223  提供一种思路。\r\n\r\n其提供一个继承于 Logger 接口的 ErrorTypeAwareLogger 接口。这个接口在记录日志时支持传入 ErrorType 对象，以确认异常的种类（可能原因）和对应的 FAQ 地址，从而能够实现在日志输出时同时附带输出对应的官网 FAQ 说明链接的功能。同时其与 Logger 接口独立，确保了向后兼容性。\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Version: \r\n\r\nThis proposal provides a solution of #10223.\r\n\r\nIt provides a interface called ErrorTypeAwareLogger, which extends Logger interface. This interface supports receiving an ErrorType instance that contains error cause and corresponding FAQ URL address. With that, the logger will also outputs a URL to instructions. It's backward-compatible since it's a seperate interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n中文：\r\n- <del> 新增了一个 ErrorType，用于代表一种（类）异常，内有异常的可能原因和异常排除文档的 URL 地址。</del>\r\n- 为了确保错误码的灵活性，根据项目组的请求，去除枚举而直接加参数。\r\n- 新增了一个 ErrorTypeAwareLogger 接口，用于代表支持传递 ErrorType 的日志 API。并新增了对应的 Fail-safe 实现。\r\n- 修改了工厂方法，使得它可以返回一个 ErrorTypeAwareLogger 对象。\r\n- 新增了它们对应的测试。\r\n\r\nEnglish Version: \r\n- <del>Created a new enum called ErrorType that represents a kind of error. It contains error cause and the corresponding address of solution document.</del>\r\n- To ensure flexibility, per project's request, remove the enumeration and add parameters into logger interface.\r\n- ErrorTypeAwareLogger, a logger interface that receives an ErrorType. The fail-safe implementation is also added.\r\n- Changed the factory method of Logger. So that it can return an instance of ErrorTypeAwareLogger.\r\n- Add some tests related to them.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n调用测试方法 / Invoke testing method below:\r\n\r\n`org.apache.dubbo.common.logger.support.FailsafeErrorTypeAwareLoggerTest#testInstructionShownOrNot`\r\n\r\n代码如下 / Code is here: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testInstructionShownOrNot() {\r\n    LoggerFactory.setLoggerAdapter(FrameworkModel.defaultModel(), \"jdk\");\r\n\r\n    ErrorTypeAwareLogger logger = LoggerFactory.getErrorTypeAwareLogger(FailsafeErrorTypeAwareLoggerTest.class);\r\n\r\n    logger.error(\"1-1\", \"Registry center\", \"May be it's offline.\",\r\n        \"error message\", new Exception(\"error\"));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n运行可以看到输出了如下消息 / After runs, the console window prints out these message: \r\n\r\n```\r\n7月 10, 2022 4:37:26 下午 org.apache.dubbo.common.logger.jdk.JdkLogger error\r\n严重:  [DUBBO] error message, dubbo version: , current host: (...), error code: 1-1. This may be caused by Registry center, go to https://dubbo.apache.org/faq/1-1 to find instructions. May be it's offline.\r\njava.lang.Exception: error\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [X] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-09T12:22:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T03:43:19Z","closed_at":"2022-07-10T12:25:46Z","merged_at":"2022-07-10T12:25:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"6095d71062bc6125167186ed0faa41d484251904","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4731fc16f6fe379764c02c4e7f8d14043d0d8196","head":{"label":"win120a:error_type_aware_logger","ref":"error_type_aware_logger","sha":"4731fc16f6fe379764c02c4e7f8d14043d0d8196","user":{"login":"win120a","id":4351489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4351489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a","html_url":"https://github.com/win120a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511510600,"node_id":"R_kgDOHn0ISA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"win120a/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"win120a","id":4351489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4351489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a","html_url":"https://github.com/win120a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/win120a/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/win120a/dubbo","description":"Apache

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-08T08:48:27Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T02:56:56Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T02:44:48Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T02:44:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"e069a7af9e2d5b920b63845d5228b6b3deca1a8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/54","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/54/labels","id":8197340,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AfRTc","number":54,"title":"3.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T08:43:20Z","due_on":"2022-08-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T09:09:51Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/97b56b3e87b3d2cca032220f801e072a4142b6f4","head":{"label":"JooKS-me:rective","ref":"rective","sha":"97b56b3e87b3d2cca032220f801e072a4142b6f4","user":{"login":"JooKS-me","id":62384022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62384022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me","html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":413638411,"node_id":"R_kgDOGKefCw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"JooKS-me/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JooKS-me","id":62384022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg0MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62384022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me","html_url":"https://github.com/JooKS-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JooKS-me/orgs","re
