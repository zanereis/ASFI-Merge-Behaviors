guys, can we consider a small kind of tactical fix (imho) to GROOVY-7879 or is it a bad idea/solution?

them being changed: \r\n`-Dlog4j.configuration=\"file:simple/path/to.properties\"`\r\nHowever, `-Dlog4j.configuration=file:simple/path/to.properties` works fine (just quotes removed)\r\nThe proposed

Background\r\nDebugging bytecode issues is a hard work, one of reasons is lack of logging.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThe PR provides LoggableClassVisitor and LoggableTextifier to make debugging easy. We can debug **step by step** and investigate bytecode generation **line by line**. Logging bytecode generation can be enabled by `-Dgroovy.log.classgen=true`

script's base class has `.lazyInitDone = true` and `.constructors = null` so when `.getSuperClass().getDeclaredConstructor(SCRIPT_CONTEXT_CTOR)` is called by `ModuleNode.createStatementsClass()`, then

suggested in PR #484 removed the locking on the `ManagedLinkedList` by creating a new `ManagedConcurrentLinkedQueue`.\r\n\r\nAlso added a `stress` subproject for tests that employ many threads, need GC, or just in general try to break things and take a long time.  These require a special property to be set in order to run, otherwise they will be skipped.  I tried to work it out in the `performance` subproject, but that seems to be very specialized for the compiler tests.
