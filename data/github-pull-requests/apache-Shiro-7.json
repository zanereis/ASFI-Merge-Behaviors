Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nHi! Noticed that the JUnit 5 migration had missed a few small steps to optimize the methods called, and sometimes swap the argument order. The compiler won't complain about such issues, but it's best to conform to JUnit 5's best practices. Hope this is helpful! It's a mostly automated change, prompted by the summons here: https://twitter.com/lobaorn/status/1763676683012317411\r\n\r\nTagging @bmarwell for review, since he opened\r\n-

Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

#1282\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-11T06:25:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T04:41:45Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T04:41:42Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T04:41:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b72d2533b1af22fdaa746cf67fbdb69e924cdb3","assignee":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2618599219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjE4NTk5MjE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/labels/shiro-2.0.0","name":"shiro-2.0.0","color":"F155AA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4619657872,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAARy8s8AAAABE1pikA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/labels/java","name":"java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

#1236 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2070\">2070</a></li>\n<li><strong>Wildcard attribute selector</strong>: Added support for the <code>[*]</code> element with any attribute selector.

The fix includes a EvaluatorDebug class\nthat generates a sexpr to represent the query, allowing simpler and more thorough query parse\ntests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2073\">2073</a></li>\n<li><strong>XML CData output</strong>: When generating XML-syntax output from parsed HTML, script nodes containing (pseudo) CData\nsections would have an extraneous CData section added, causing script execution errors. Now, the data content is\nemitted in a HTML/XML/XHTML polyglot format, if the data is not already within a CData\nsection. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078\">2078</a></li>\n<li><strong>Thread safety</strong>: The <code>:has</code> evaluator held a non-thread-safe Iterator, and so if an Evaluator object was\nshared across multiple concurrent threads, a NoSuchElement exception may be thrown, and the selected results may be\nincorrect.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

some package-private methods whose signature includes the Java 8 <code>Collector</code> API. This is a test to identify any problems before we expose those methods publicly to users. Please report any problems that you encounter. (73dbf7ef26)</li>\n<li>Changed various classes to catch <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>RuntimeException</code> even when only <code>RuntimeException</code> is theoretically possible. This can help code that throws undeclared exceptions, as some bytecode rewriters (e.g., Robolectric) and languages (e.g., Kotlin) do. (c294c23760, 747924e, b2baf48)</li>\n<li>Added an <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> to <code>failureaccess</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">Guava's one strong runtime dependency</a>. (280b5d2f60)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: In <code>guava-android</code> only, removed <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. These methods never worked in an Android VM, and to reflect that, they were born <code>@Deprecated</code>, <code>@Beta</code>, and <code>@DoNotCall</code>. They're now preventing us from rolling out some new Android compatibility testing. This is <strong>the only binary-incompatible change in this release</strong>, and it should have no effect in practice. Still, we bump the major version number to follow Semantic Versioning.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version
