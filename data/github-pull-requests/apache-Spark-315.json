What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded support for ANALYZE TABLE [db_name].tablename PARTITION (partcol1[=val1], partcol2[=val2], ...) COMPUTE STATISTICS [NOSCAN] SQL command to calculate total number of rows and size in bytes for a subset of partitions. Calculated statistics are stored in Hive Metastore as user-defined properties attached to partition objects. Property names are the same as the ones used to store table-level statistics: spark.sql.statistics.totalSize and spark.sql.statistics.numRows.\r\n\r\nWhen partition specification contains all partition columns with values, the command collects statistics for a single partition that matches the specification. When some partition columns are missing or listed without their values, the command collects statistics for all partitions which match a subset of partition column values specified.\r\n\r\nFor example, table t has 4 partitions with the following specs:\r\n\r\n* Partition1: (ds='2008-04-08', hr=11)\r\n* Partition2: (ds='2008-04-08', hr=12)\r\n* Partition3: (ds='2008-04-09', hr=11)\r\n* Partition4: (ds='2008-04-09', hr=12)\r\n\r\n'ANALYZE TABLE t PARTITION (ds='2008-04-09', hr=11)' command will collect statistics only for partition 3.\r\n\r\n'ANALYZE TABLE t PARTITION (ds='2008-04-09')' command will collect statistics for partitions 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n'ANALYZE TABLE t PARTITION (ds, hr)' command will collect statistics for all four partitions.\r\n\r\nWhen the optional parameter NOSCAN is specified, the command doesn't count number of rows and only gathers size in bytes.\r\n\r\nThe statistics gathered by ANALYZE TABLE command can be fetched using DESC EXTENDED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nin https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18064, to work around the nested sql execution id issue, we introduced several internal methods in `Dataset`, like `collectInternal`, `countInternal`, `showInternal`, etc., to avoid nested execution id.\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach has poor expansibility. When we hit other nested execution id cases, we may need to add more internal methods in `Dataset`.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to ignore the nested execution id in some cases, and we can have a better approach to achieve this goal, by introducing `SQLExecution.ignoreNestedExecutionId`. Whenever we find a place which needs to ignore the nested execution, we can just wrap the action with `SQLExecution.ignoreNestedExecutionId`, and this is more expansible than the previous approach.\r\n\r\nThe idea comes from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17540/files#diff-ab49028253e599e6e74cc4f4dcb2e3a8R57 by @rdblue \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe issue happens in `ExternalMapToCatalyst`. For example, the following codes create `ExternalMapToCatalyst` to convert Scala Map to catalyst map format.\r\n\r\n    val data = Seq.tabulate(10)(i => NestedData(1, Map(\"key\" -> InnerData(\"name\", i + 100))))\r\n    val ds = spark.createDataset(data)\r\n\r\nThe `valueConverter` in `ExternalMapToCatalyst` looks like:\r\n\r\n    if (isnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true))) null else named_struct(name, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, assertnotnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true)).name, true), value, assertnotnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true)).value)\r\n\r\nThere is a `CreateNamedStruct` expression (`named_struct`) to create a row of `InnerData.name` and `InnerData.value` that are referred by `ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52`.\r\n\r\nBecause `ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52` are local variable, when `CreateNamedStruct` splits expressions to individual functions, the local variable can't be accessed anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-26T04:32:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:49Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T16:59:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f46e6ecba5101823aa7406a7f52c1a07d4228803","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cffb09bf7e7b2efc0b56bbebbaecbb21676127b2","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-19104","ref":"SPARK-19104","sha":"cffb09bf7e7b2efc0b56bbebbaecbb21676127b2","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-25T10:43:03Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:35Z","closed_at":"2017-07-06T17:10:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ab43bd986ae161fc5bbf23e9dedd79cbcc91ba4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2464c292780d2d795468046e945a04195956dc8","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-21204","ref":"SPARK-21204","sha":"e2464c292780d2d795468046e945a04195956dc8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark-HA, after active master failure, stand-by mater is choosen and workers,applications will be re-registered with new master.\r\nHowever, application state is not moving from WAITING state to RUNNING state.\r\n\r\nThis code change checks applications after recovery and if all executors are RUNNING\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\nIn the method completeRecovery in org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master class, where cleanup of the workers and applictions is being done,\r\ni have added code change to move the application to RUNNING state, if application has more than 1 executors and all of them are in RUNNING status.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, executors will be in LOADING status, but we cannot consider those to change application state to RUNNING, as executors in LOADING status might also happen due to resource unavailability.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTo check existing bug.\r\n\t1) Created a zookeeper cluster\r\n\t2) I have configured spark with recovery mode zookeeper and updated spark-env.sh with recovery mode settings.\r\n\t3) Updated spark-defaults in both worker and master with both the masters. spark://<host1>:7077,<host2>:7077 \r\n\t4) Started spark master1 and spark master 2 and and workers in the order.\r\n\t5) master1 is ACTIVE and master2 showed as STANDBY.\r\n\t6) Started a sample streaming application.\r\n\t7) Killed the spark-master1, and waited for the workers and applications to appear in master2. They appeared and job showed up in WAITING state.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo check implemented fix:\r\n\t1) I have built spark-core  \r\n\t2) removed spark-core jar in SPARK_HOME/jars folder and replaced with the newly built one.\r\n\t3) Performed the same steps as above, and checked job status\r\n\t4) checked spark-master logs to ensure the log message got printed and\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nMaster 1 UI Before

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are explicitly calling release on the byteBuf's used to encode the string to Base64 to suppress the memory leak error message reported by netty. This is to make it less confusing for the user.\r\n\r\n### Changes proposed in this fix\r\nBy explicitly invoking release on the byteBuf's we are decrement the internal reference counts for the wrappedByteBuf's. Now, when the GC kicks in, these would be reclaimed as before, just that netty wouldn't report any memory leak error messages as the internal ref. counts are now 0.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan a few spark-applications and examined the logs. The error message no longer appears.\r\n\r\nOriginal PR was opened against branch-2.1 =>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Override beforeFetch method in OracleDialect to finish the following two things:\r\n    -  Set Oracle's NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT to \"YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF\" to match java.sql.Timestamp format.\r\n    -  Set Oracle's NLS_DATE_FORMAT to \"YYYY-MM-DD\" to match java.sql.Date format.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Timestamp and Date type are the same data type in the versions of oracle jdbc after 10g. So we should differentiate Date type from Timestamp type to make sure the Date-related predicates can be pushed down to Oracle correctly. The related work is done in the getCatalystType method of the OracleDialect object.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAn integration test has been added and a existing unit test has been modified.","created_at":"2017-06-23T12:12:56Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T14:35:53Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T13:10:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52364a6d6511a099b177570ef771887e1df3de05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18404/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18404/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c686cd9099d56232d44d81e836d099094e56bc26","head":{"label":"SharpRay:branch-2.1","ref":"branch-2.1","sha":"c686cd9099d56232d44d81e836d099094e56bc26","user":{"login":"SharpRay","id":5441176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDExNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay","html_url":"https://github.com/SharpRay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SharpRay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"acd208ee50b29bde4e097bf88761867b1d57a665","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf the SQL conf for StateStore provider class is changed between restarts (i.e. query started with providerClass1 and attempted to restart using providerClass2), then the query will fail in a unpredictable way as files saved by one provider class cannot be used by the newer one.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the provider class used to start the query should be used to restart the query, and the configuration in the session where it is being restarted should be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis PR saves the provider class config to OffsetSeqLog, in the same way #

other\r\nvariables, and more importantly, environment variables, providing\r\na secure way to provide passwords to Spark when using SSL.\r\n\r\nThe approach is a little bit hacky, but is the smallest change possible.\r\nOtherwise, the concept of \"namespaced configs\" would have to be added\r\nto the config system, which would create a lot of noise for not much\r\ngain at this point.\r\n\r\nTested with added unit tests, and on a real cluster with SSL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are explicitly calling release on the byteBuf's used to encode the string to Base64 to suppress the memory leak error message reported by netty. This is to make it less confusing for the user. \r\n\r\n\r\n## changes proposed in this fix\r\nBy explicitly invoking release on the byteBuf's we are decrement the internal reference counts for the wrappedByteBuf's. Now, when the GC kicks in, these would be reclaimed as before, just that netty wouldn't report any memory leak error messages as the internal ref. counts are now 0.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan a few spark-applications and examined the logs. The error message no longer appears.","created_at":"2017-06-22T16:48:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T14:24:58Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T14:24:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2660fdf0445eea774a2139d3483b8d64e50c42b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/acabec07e44832d4828bf2b9fee0d709ed4f8c59","head":{"label":"dhruve:bug/SPARK-21181","ref":"bug/SPARK-21181","sha":"acabec07e44832d4828bf2b9fee0d709ed4f8c59","user":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54914940,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDkxNDk0MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dhruve/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA shuffle service can serves blocks from multiple apps/tasks. Thus the shuffle service can suffers high memory usage when lots of shuffle-reads happen at the same time. In my cluster, OOM always happens on shuffle service. Analyzing heap dump, memory cost by Netty(ChannelOutboundBuffer@Entry) can be up to 2~3G. It might make sense to reject \"open blocks\" request when memory usage is high on shuffle service.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/93dd0c518d040155b04e5ab258c5835aec7776fc and https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/85c6ce61930490e2247fb4b0e22dfebbb8b6a1ee tried to alleviate the memory pressure on shuffle service but cannot solve the root cause. This pr proposes to control currency of shuffle read.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the validation of sampling fraction in dataset is incomplete.\r\nAs an improvement, validate sampling fraction in logical operator level:\r\n1) if with replacement: fraction should be nonnegative\r\n2) else: fraction should be on interval [0, 1]\r\nAlso add test cases for the validation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nintegration tests\r\n\r\n@gatorsmile @cloud-fan \r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe input query schema of INSERT AS SELECT could be changed after optimization. For example, the following query's output schema is changed by the rule `SimplifyCasts` and `RemoveRedundantAliases`.\r\n```SQL\r\n SELECT word, length, cast(first as string) as first FROM view1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issue in Spark 2.2. Instead of using the analyzed plan of the input query, this PR use its executed plan to determine the attributes in `FileFormatWriter`.\r\n\r\nThe related issue in the master branch has been fixed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18064. After this PR is merged, I will submit a separate PR to merge the test case to the master.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test

Idea\r\n\r\nThis PR adds validation to REFRESH sql statements. Currently, users can specify whatever they want as resource path. For example, spark.sql(\"REFRESH ! $ !\") will be executed without any exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Implementation \r\n\r\nI am not sure that my current implementation is the most optimal, so any feedback is appreciated. My first idea was to make the grammar as strict as possible. Unfortunately, there were some problems. I tried the approach below:\r\n\r\nSqlBase.g4\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    | REFRESH TABLE tableIdentifier                                    #refreshTable\r\n    | REFRESH resourcePath                                             #refreshResource\r\n...\r\n\r\nresourcePath\r\n    : STRING\r\n    | (IDENTIFIER | number | nonReserved | '/' | '-')+ // other symbols can be added if needed\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\nIt is not flexible enough and requires to explicitly mention all possible symbols. Therefore, I came up with the current approach that is implemented in the code.\r\n\r\nLet me know your opinion on which one is better.","created_at":"2017-06-20T21:23:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T18:24:24Z","closed_at":"2017-07-03T16:38:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e17a40c0b231dff76b555fb1c392e6b08c52dab4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ab9191cf2dd539a7f6f8c539392645bcca33fcc","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-21102","ref":"spark-21102","sha":"6ab9191cf2dd539a7f6f8c539392645bcca33fcc","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTime windowing in Spark currently performs an Expand + Filter, because there is no way to guarantee the amount of windows a timestamp will fall in, in the general case. However, for tumbling windows, a record is guaranteed to fall into a single bucket. In this case, doubling the number of records with Expand is wasteful, and can be improved by using a simple Projection instead.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show that we get an order of magnitude performance improvement after this patch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests. Benchmarked using the following code:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\nspark.time { \r\n  spark.range(numRecords)\r\n    .select(from_unixtime((current_timestamp().cast(\"long\") * 1000 + 'id / 1000) / 1000) as 'time)\r\n    .select(window('time, \"10 seconds\"))\r\n    .count()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n - 1 c3.2xlarge worker (8 cores)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5243515/27348748-ed991b84-55a9-11e7-8f8b-6e7abc524417.png)\r\n\r\n1 B rows ran in 287 seconds after this optimization. I didn't wait for it to finish without the optimization. Shows about 5x improvement for large number of records.","created_at":"2017-06-20T16:13:38Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:54:10Z","closed_at":"2017-06-26T08:29:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdefd632c90db936f44baa3261f7aced071cb307","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c59a0dee87b7e3dde4154d7bb22e7219ba5cb217","head":{"label":"brkyvz:opt-tumble","ref":"opt-tumble","sha":"c59a0dee87b7e3dde4154d7bb22e7219ba5cb217","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn standalone mode, master should explicitly inform each active driver of any worker deaths, so the invalid external shuffle service outputs on the lost host would be removed from the shuffle mapStatus, thus we can avoid future `FetchFailure`s.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested by the following steps:\r\n1. Start a standalone Spark cluster with one driver node and two worker nodes;\r\n2. Run a Job with ShuffleMapStage, ensure the outputs distribute on each worker;\r\n3. Run another Job to make all executors exit, but the workers are all alive;\r\n4. Kill one of the workers;\r\n5. Run rdd.collect(), before this change, we should see `FetchFailure`s and failed Stages, while after the change, the job should complete without failure.\r\n\r\nBefore the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nStateStoreProvider instances are loaded on-demand in a executor when a query is started. When a query is restarted, the loaded provider instance will get reused. Now, there is a non-trivial chance, that the task of the previous query run is still running, while the tasks of the restarted run has started. So for a stateful partition, there may be two concurrent tasks related to the same stateful partition, and there for using the same provider instance. This can lead to inconsistent results and possibly random failures, as state store implementations are not designed to be thread-safe.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I have introduced a `StateStoreProviderId`, that unique identifies a provider loaded in an executor. It has the query run id in it, thus making sure that restarted queries will force the executor to load a new provider instance, thus avoiding two concurrent tasks (from two different runs) from reusing the same provider instance.\r\n\r\nAdditional minor bug fixes\r\n- All state stores related to query run is marked as deactivated in the `StateStoreCoordinator` so that the executors can unload them and clear resources.\r\n- Moved the code that determined the checkpoint directory of a state store from implementation-specific code (`HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider`) to non-specific code (StateStoreId), so that implementation do not accidentally get it wrong.\r\n  - Also added store name to the path, to support multiple stores per sql operator partition.\r\n\r\n*Note:* This change does not address the scenario where two tasks of the same run (e.g. speculative tasks) are concurrently running in the same executor. The chance of this very small, because ideally speculative tasks should never run in the same executor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests + new unit test.","created_at":"2017-06-19T23:06:47Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T10:02:24Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T07:46:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd5b73118c20fca64cdb628525de018fdae254a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/762fe60fc85659400923c56f79c48d7d39d5fd1a","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-21145","ref":"SPARK-21145","sha":"762fe60fc85659400923c56f79c48d7d39d5fd1a","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is going to prevent codegen-only expressions from collapsing into upper `CodegenFallback` expression and cause an exception in runtime.\r\n\r\nThe rule `CollapseProject` in optimizer collapses lower and upper expressions if they have common expressions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a use case that `MapObjects` is used to do some operations on array elements. A custom `CodegenFallback` expression is then used to process those results.\r\n\r\n`MapObjects` is a codegen-only expression and it is collapsed with upper `CodegenFallback`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI think the mode of batch gradient in Graphx SVDPlusPlus is incorrect. The changes of this pull request are as blow:\r\n* Use the mean of batch gradient instead of the sum of batch gradient.\r\n* When calculating the residual of each rating during iteration,  the pred value shouldn't be limit in (minVal, maxVal)\r\n* The method \"calculateIterationRMSE\" is added to show the iteration effect clearly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI test SVDPlusPlus locally by using movielens-100k dataset.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes three things as below:\r\n\r\n**Install packages per documentation** - this does not affect the tests itself (but CRAN which we are not doing via AppVeyor) up to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis adds `knitr` and `rmarkdown` per https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/45824fb608930eb461e7df53bb678c9534c183a9/R/WINDOWS.md#unit-tests (please see https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/45824fb608930eb461e7df53bb678c9534c183a9)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Improve logs/shorten logs** - actually, long logs can be a problem on AppVeyor (e.g., see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17873)\r\n\r\n`R -e ...` repeats printing R information for each invocation as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nR version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21) -- \"Bug in Your

on-line help, or\r\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\r\nType 'q()' to quit R.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks reducing the call might be slightly better and print out the versions together looks more readable.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# R information ...\r\n> packageVersion('testthat')\r\n[1] '1.0.2'\r\n> \r\n> \r\n\r\n# R information ...\r\n> packageVersion('e1071')\r\n[1] '1.6.8'\r\n> \r\n> \r\n... 3 more times\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# R information ...\r\n> packageVersion('knitr'); packageVersion('rmarkdown'); packageVersion('testthat'); packageVersion('e1071'); packageVersion('survival')\r\n[1] ‘1.16’\r\n[1] ‘1.6’\r\n[1] ‘1.0.2’\r\n[1] ‘1.6.8’\r\n[1] ‘2.41.3’\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Add`appveyor.yml`/`dev/appveyor-install-dependencies.ps1` for triggering the test**\r\n\r\nChanging this file might break the test, e.g., https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16927\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBefore (please see https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HyukjinKwon/spark/build/169-master)\r\nAfter (please see the AppVeyor build in this

running a local Spark shell on the built UI.

this addition.\r\n\r\nAlso ran the existing tests.\r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and that I license the work to the project under the project's open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs stated in [SPARK-19909](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19909), if the `checkpointLocation` is not set, for some formats Spark falls back using a directory in the `java.io.tmp` dir to store the metadata. This fails with a weird exception (permission denied) if the default filesystem is different from the temp one. This is the case if the default filesystem is HDFS, for instance, and the temp directory is written on the local filesystem. \r\n\r\nThe change proposed in this PR disables the usage of the temp directory in this case. Thus, a meaningful `AnalysisException` is thrown, suggesting the proper fix to the user, i.e. to set a value for `checkpointLocation`, instead of a `PermissionDenied` exception which is hard to understand and fix.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is consistent with what happens in all the cases in which the `checkpointLocation` needs to be set.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA unit test was added to check the patch and all the unit tests have been run.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-16T14:39:47Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T13:50:58Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T13:50:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"798cc886287ac01a7eb30572d2426456063d365a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a56ecf184de9d19938dd881e1634bef609e7927","head":{"label":"mgaido91:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a56ecf184de9d19938dd881e1634bef609e7927","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror
