What is this PR for?\r\nAs mentioned in ZEPPELIN-2963, if a paragraph is cancelled while it was in scheduler's waiting queue, the next run of the paragraph always ends up in abort status. This change fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2963\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nThe scenario that we want to reproduce is that a paragraph in the notebook should be cancelled when it is still in the remote scheduler's waiting queue. This can be reproduced in various ways. Following is the approach that I used:\r\n1. Start zeppelin server.\r\n2. Create a notebook with around 10-15 paragraphs with a few paragraphs being long running (at least a few seconds)\r\n3. Do a \"Run All\" on the notebook\r\n4. Cancel the last paragraph (non-empty) by clicking the \"Pause\" button. It will move to abort status.\r\n5. After all paragraphs finish running, run the cancelled paragraph again. It should start running.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n![paragraph_abort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6438072/31125615-7fa5f9a2-a866-11e7-9f1d-0ffa509ab3c4.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\n![paragraph_abort_fixed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6438072/31126292-ea1b7df0-a868-11e7-9b21-fafdeda96da8.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

Main changes on Interpreter\r\n* Add throw `InterpreterException` which is checked exception for the abstract methods of `Interpreter`, this would enforce the interpreter implementation to throw `InterpreterException`.\r\n* field name refactoring.\r\n\r\n     * `property` -> `properties`\r\n     * `getProperty()` --> `getProperties()`\r\n* Introduce launcher layer for interpreter launching. Currently we only use shell script to launch interpreter, but it could be any other service or component to launch interpreter, such as livy server , other 3rd party tools or even we may create a separate module for interpreter launcher \r\n\r\n     * abstract cass `InterpreterLauncher`\r\n     * For now, only 2 implementation: `ShellScriptLauncher` & `SparkInterpreterLauncher`. We could add method in class `Interpreter` to allow interpreter to specify its own launcher class, but it could be future work.\r\n  \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2685\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUnit test is covered. `ShellScriptLauncherTest` & `SparkInterpreterLauncherTest`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-19T06:54:32Z","updated_at":"2017-10-14T05:46:49Z","closed_at":"2017-10-14T05:46:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"335ba5385592664107b1a0a09e8db51d77136c92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/17dc2f1177af1159f13b85b2c17fa3f6aee6e410","head":{"label":"zjffdu:ZEPPELIN-2685","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2685","sha":"17dc2f1177af1159f13b85b2c17fa3f6aee6e410","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46907161,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjkwNzE2MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"zjffdu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

But there's still improvement to be done in future, e.g. I put some spark specific logic in `InterpreterSetting` which is not a good practise.  I plan to improve it when I refactor the `Interpreter` class (ZEPPELIN-2685). \r\n\r\nBesides that, I also add `MiniHadoopCluster` & `MiniZeppelin` which help for the integration test of yarn-client & yarn-cluster mode, otherwise I have to manually verify yarn-client & yarn-cluster mode which would easily cause regression issue in future.\r\n\r\nTo be noticed:\r\n\r\n* SPARK_HOME must be specified for yarn-cluster mode\r\n* HADOOP_CONF_DIR must be specified for yarn-cluster mode\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin/tree/ZEPPELIN-2898\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nSystem test is added in `SparkInterpreterIT`. \r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n1. As part https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2218, it was agreed upon that we can take out and move the remove paragraph button up front so that user don't have to go to the drop-down menu so that it will be a click away.\r\n2. Paragraph control buttons are having a span as a markup and hence we had to add `cursor: pointer`. This was semantically incorrect and hence changed it to correct markup to use button and removed the unwanted inline css.\r\nDue to this change, it will show mouse hover button highlight which was not present earlier.\r\n3. The gear icon for the dropdown is used for interpreter bindings as well, instead changed the icon to horizontal ellipsis as it shows extra items which are not available upfront\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2834\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Build: mvn clean package -Denforcer.skip -DskipTests -Drat.skip\r\n2. Open a paragraph\r\n3.

I would suggest you to read the unit test first. These unit test is very readable and easy to understand what the code is doing now. `InterpreterFactoryTest`, `InterpreterGroupTest`, `InterpreterSettingTest`, `InterpreterSettingManagerTest`, `RemoteInterpreterTest`.\r\nRemove the referent counting logic. Now I will kill the interpreter process as long as all the sessions in the same interpreter group is closed. (I plan to add another kind of policy for the interpreter process lifecycle control, ZEPPELIN-2197)\r\nThe RemoteFunction I introduced is for reducing code duplicates when we use RPC.\r\nThe changes in `Job.java` and `RemoteScheduler` is for fixing the race issue bug.

is this PR for?\r\n\r\nin save-as.service.js, if we use URI Data scheme, we could only contain 2MB data in chrome. using the createObjectURL and File API's blob feature, i managed to upgrade the capacity to about 900MB. plus this update is better in debugging too. if we exceed the 2MB limit in URI data scheme, the download just failed with no accurate console log originally, so it was kinda hard to know why this happens. But using this technique, if it exceeds the 900MB limit, the console log points directly about what the problem is. like this : Uncaught RangeError: Failed to construct 'Blob': Array length exceeds supported limit.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/notebook/save-as/save-as.service.js\r\n\r\n###What type of PR is

tested?\r\n\r\nopen zeppelin using chrome. make a table by select, then download it by csv or tsv. the table should be BIG, like really big, (but not that big for companies, which is my case) to test. in the original version if the whole data exceeds 2MB, you could see that the download fails. but using my script, it doesn't fail until it reaches about 900MB~1GB, which is a tremendous improvement.\r\n\r\n###Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\ni'll post it later if you really need it. but i'm pretty sure you guys know what i'm talking about :)\r\n\r\n###Questions:\r\n\r\nDoes the licenses files need update? no (i guess)\r\nIs there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\nDoes this needs documentation? maybe?","created_at":"2017-08-15T06:49:51Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T22:19:21Z","closed_at":"2017-08-22T22:19:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52be3cec453f5e6aa16d985085bd43a7364de535","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/075c4ece92a8b6d75e3e46f1bc00bc9354cd9b51","head":{"label":"hbseong97:master","ref":"master","sha":"075c4ece92a8b6d75e3e46f1bc00bc9354cd9b51","user":{"login":"hbseong97","id":22850304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODUwMzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22850304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97","html_url":"https://github.com/hbseong97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbseong97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"340b326d47f3e07b7d98c2760b41c10424bfbb30","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nWith this PR, I attempt to use Hadoop-filesystem API to implement `NotebookRepo`, which in my opinion is very generic in nature, as with this we will be able to support multiple scheme of the URI like local file system `file:///`, Hadoop file system `hdfs://localhost:8020`, S3 etc. So far I have tested this only with local and HDFS.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Periodic refresh of kerberos ticket.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1515\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nIn zeppelin-site.xml enable these two configs; to write into HDFS.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>\r\n
