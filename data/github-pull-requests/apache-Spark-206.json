What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is a follow-up to fill the gap in #29272 which missed to also provide `default.api.timeout.ms` as well.  #29272 unintentionally changed the behavior on Kafka side timeout which is incompatible with the test timeout. (`default.api.timeout.ms` gets default value which is 60 seconds, longer than test timeout.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe realized the PR for SPARK-32468 (#29272) doesn't work as we expect. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29272#issuecomment-668333483 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as it only touches the tests.\r\n\r\n###

Currently if the query is a full outer join, we only use sort merge join as the physical operator. However it can be CPU and IO intensive in case input table is large for sort merge join. Shuffled hash join on the other hand saves the sort CPU and IO compared to sort merge join, especially when table is large.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full outer join as followed:\r\n* Process rows from stream side by looking up hash relation, and mark the matched rows from build side by:\r\n  * for joining with unique key, a `BitSet` is used to record matched rows from build side (`key index` to represent each row)\r\n  * for joining with non-unique key, a `HashSet[Long]` is  used to record matched rows from build side (`key index` + `value index` to represent each row).\r\n`key index` is defined as the index into key addressing array `longArray` in `BytesToBytesMap`.\r\n`value index` is defined as the iterator index of values for same key.\r\n\r\n* Process rows from build side by iterating hash relation, and filter out rows from build side being looked up already (done in `ShuffledHashJoinExec.fullOuterJoin`)\r\n\r\nFor context, this PR was originally implemented as followed (up to commit https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342/commits/e3322766d4ea6d039f819a46e12dc8641ca59c63):\r\n1. Construct hash relation from build side, with extra boolean value at the end of row to track look up information (done in `ShuffledHashJoinExec.buildHashedRelation` and `UnsafeHashedRelation.apply`).\r\n2. Process rows from stream side by looking up hash relation, and mark the matched rows from build side be looked up (done in `ShuffledHashJoinExec.fullOuterJoin`).\r\n3. Process rows from build side by iterating hash relation, and filter out rows from build side being looked up already (done in `ShuffledHashJoinExec.fullOuterJoin`). \r\n\r\n\r\nSee discussion of pros and cons between these two approaches [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342#issuecomment-672275450), [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342#issuecomment-672288194) and [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29342#issuecomment-672640531).\r\n\r\nTODO: codegen for full outer shuffled hash join can be implemented in another followup PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs implementation in this PR, full outer shuffled hash join will have overhead to iterate build side twice (once for building hash map, and another for outputting non-matching rows), and iterate stream side once. However, full outer sort merge join needs to iterate both sides twice, and sort the large table can be more CPU and IO intensive. So full outer shuffled hash join can be more efficient than sort merge join when stream side is much more larger than build side.\r\n\r\nFor example query below, full outer SHJ saved 30% wall clock time compared to full outer SMJ.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef shuffleHashJoin(): Unit = {\r\n    val N: Long = 4 << 22\r\n    withSQLConf(\r\n      SQLConf.SHUFFLE_PARTITIONS.key -> \"2\",\r\n      SQLConf.AUTO_BROADCASTJOIN_THRESHOLD.key -> \"20000000\") {\r\n      codegenBenchmark(\"shuffle hash join\", N) {\r\n        val df1 = spark.range(N).selectExpr(s\"cast(id as string) as k1\")\r\n        val df2 = spark.range(N / 10).selectExpr(s\"cast(id * 10 as string) as k2\")\r\n        val df = df1.join(df2, col(\"k1\") === col(\"k2\"), \"full_outer\")\r\n        df.noop()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning benchmark: shuffle hash join\r\n  Running case: shuffle hash join off\r\n  Stopped after 2 iterations, 16602 ms\r\n  Running case: shuffle hash join on\r\n  Stopped after 5 iterations, 31911 ms\r\n\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_181-b13 on Mac OS X 10.15.4\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\nshuffle hash join:                        Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nshuffle hash join off                              7900           8301         567          2.1         470.9       1.0X\r\nshuffle hash join on                               6250           6382          95          2.7         372.5       1.3X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake WithFields Expression not foldable. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe following query currently fails on master brach: \r\n```\r\nsql(\"SELECT named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2) a\")\r\n.select($\"a\".withField(\"c\", lit(3)).as(\"a\"))\r\n.show(false)\r\n// java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot evaluate expression: with_fields(named_struct(a, 1, b, 2), c, 3)\r\n```\r\nThis happens because the Catalyst optimizer sees that the WithFields Expression is foldable and tries to statically evaluate the WithFields Expression (via the ConstantFolding rule), however it cannot do so because WithFields Expression is Unevaluable. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, queries like the one shared above will now succeed. \r\nThat said, this bug was introduced in Spark 3.1.0 which has yet to be released. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate pom, with the latest release of jackson to 2.9.10 and 2.9.10.5. Which have fixes for all the reported CVEs so far - as per github advisories page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Apache Spark branch-2.4 depends on jackson release, which is not maintained (as per comment in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2186#issuecomment-667243159). \r\n\r\nThere are some CVEs reported on the issue SPARK-32495 , but my understanding is since the release is not a maintained version, the advisory info is not up to date.\r\nAnd it is also possible, that there are vulnerabilities which apply to higher version and are not yet reported for the un-maintained release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the downstream users of spark who continue to depend on the older jackson release, will have to upgrade too.\r\nIf the package is affected with high severity security vulnerability, it might still be a good step.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-03T08:29:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T09:47:39Z","closed_at":"2020-08-27T09:47:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c91f453aa5608dd9356383d97ce22229018c387","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cff657a495af5067cd0a0d0ad935de7005d1713","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:update-jackson","ref":"update-jackson","sha":"7cff657a495af5067cd0a0d0ad935de7005d1713","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to report the failed and succeeded tests in GitHub Actions in order to improve the development velocity by leveraging [ScaCap/action-surefire-report](https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report). See the example below:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 8 17 52 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/90128649-28f7f280-dda2-11ea-9211-e98e34332f6b.png)\r\n\r\nNote that we cannot just use [ScaCap/action-surefire-report](https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report) in Apache Spark because PRs are from the forked repository, and GitHub secrets are unavailable for the security reason. This plugin and all similar plugins require to have the GitHub token that has the write access in order to post test results but it is unavailable in PRs.\r\n\r\nTo work around this limitation, I took this approach:\r\n\r\n1. In workflow A, run the tests and upload the JUnit XML test results. GitHub provides to upload and download some files.\r\n2. GitHub introduced new event type [`workflow_run`](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/) 10 days ago. By leveraging this, it triggers another workflow B.\r\n3. Workflow B is in the main repo instead of fork repo, and has the write access the plugin needs. In workflow B, it downloads the artifact uploaded from workflow A (from the forked repository).\r\n4. Workflow B generates the test reports to port from JUnit xml files.\r\n5. Workflow B looks up the PR and posts the test reports.\r\n\r\nThe `workflow_run` event is very new feature, and looks not so many GitHub Actions plugins support. In order to make this working with [ScaCap/action-surefire-report](https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report), I had to fork two GitHub Actions plugins to use:\r\n - [ScaCap/action-surefire-report](https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report) to have this custom fix: https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/action-surefire-report/commit/c96094cc35061fcf154a7cb46807f2f3e2339476\r\n    It added `commit` argument to specify the commit to post the test reports. With `workflow_run`, it can access, in workflow B, to the commit from workflow A.\r\n\r\n - [dawidd6/action-download-artifact](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact) to have this custom fix: https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/action-download-artifact/commit/750b71af351aba467757d7be6924199bb08db4ed\r\n    It added the support of downloading all artifacts from workflow A, in workflow B. By default, it only supports to specify the name of artifact.\r\n\r\n    Note that I was not able to use the official [actions/download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact) because:\r\n      - It does not support to download artifacts between different workflows, see also https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/issues/3. Once this issue is resolved, we can switch it back to [actions/download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact).\r\n\r\nI plan to make a pull request for both repositories so we don't have to rely on forks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's difficult to check the failed tests. You should scroll down long logs from GitHub Actions logs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested at: https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/17, https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/18, https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/19, https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/20, and master branch of my forked repository.","created_at":"2020-08-03T08:04:49Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:06:28Z","closed_at":"2020-08-14T03:51:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f1db1ffc5a9d7044b1b330c31ea74f2a6496d6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c36ec7a93b5fe1715016f918e3005673a480214f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32357-fix","ref":"SPARK-32357-fix","sha":"c36ec7a93b5fe1715016f918e3005673a480214f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Make `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.maxNumConcurrentTasks()` considers all kinds of resources when calculating the max concurrent tasks\r\n\r\n2. Refactor `calculateAvailableSlots()` to make it be able to be used for both `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` and `TaskSchedulerImpl`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.maxNumConcurrentTasks()` only considers the CPU for the max concurrent tasks. This can cause the application to hang when a barrier stage requires extra custom resources but the cluster doesn't have enough corresponding resources. Because, without the checking for other custom resources in `maxNumConcurrentTasks`, the barrier stage can be submitted to the `TaskSchedulerImpl`. But the `TaskSchedulerImpl` won't launch tasks for the barrier stage due to the insufficient task slots calculated by `TaskSchedulerImpl.calculateAvailableSlots` (which does check all kinds of resources).\r\n\r\nThe application hang issue can be reproduced by the added unit test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. In case of a barrier stage requires more custom resources than the cluster has, the application can get hang before this PR but can fail due to insufficient resources at the end after this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test.","created_at":"2020-08-03T06:09:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T06:44:38Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T05:40:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c946499eb8432519dc54867a1e9869b56168de3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/786b145771a12004668ea35afdc6e4054924bfed","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-slots","ref":"fix-slots","sha":"786b145771a12004668ea35afdc6e4054924bfed","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY_3` as a built-in `StorageLevel`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn a YARN cluster, HDFS uaually provides storages with replication factor 3. So, we can save the result to HDFS to get `StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY_3` technically. However, disaggregate clusters or clusters without storage services are rising. Previously, in that situation, the users were able to use similar `MEMORY_AND_DISK_2` or a user-created `StorageLevel`. This PR aims to support those use cases officially for better UX.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pull-request is to add support for reading ORC/Parquet files with SymlinkTextInputFormat in Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHive style symlink (SymlinkTextInputFormat) is commonly used in different analytic engines including prestodb and prestosql.\r\nCurrently SymlinkTextInputFormat works with JSON/CSV files but does not work with ORC/Parquet files in Apache Spark (and Apache Hive).\r\nOn the other hand, prestodb and prestosql support SymlinkTextInputFormat with ORC/Parquet files.\r\nThis pull-request is to add support for reading ORC/Parquet files with SymlinkTextInputFormat in Apache Spark.\r\n\r\nSee details in the JIRA.  SPARK-32432\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nCurrently Spark returns exceptions if users try to use SymlinkTextInputFormat with ORC/Parquet files.\r\nWith this patch, Spark can handle symlink which indicates locations of ORC/Parquet files.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the behavior consistent for the `path` option when loading dataframes with a single path (e.g, `option(\"path\", path).format(\"parquet\").load(path)` vs. `option(\"path\", path).parquet(path)`) by disallowing `path` option to coexist with `load`'s path parameters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is inconsistent:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(1).toDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/test\")\r\n                                                                                \r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"path\", \"/tmp/test\").format(\"parquet\").load(\"/tmp/test\").show\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|    1|\r\n+-----+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"path\", \"/tmp/test\").parquet(\"/tmp/test\").show\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|    1|\r\n|    1|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now if the `path` option is specified along with `load`'s path parameters, it would fail:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(1).toDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/test\")\r\n                                                                                \r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"path\",

Either remove the path option or move it into the load() parameters.;\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.verifyPathOptionDoesNotExist(DataFrameReader.scala:310)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:232)\r\n  ... 47 elided\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"path\", \"/tmp/test\").parquet(\"/tmp/test\").show\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: There is a path option set and load() is called with path parameters.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR replaces the hard-coded non-nullability of the array elements returned by `freqItems()` with a nullability that reflects the original schema. Essentially [the functional change](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25575/files#diff-bf59bb9f3dc351f5bf6624e5edd2dcf4R122) to the schema generation is:\r\n```\r\nStructField(name + \"_freqItems\", ArrayType(dataType, false))\r\n```\r\nBecomes:\r\n```\r\nStructField(name + \"_freqItems\", ArrayType(dataType, originalField.nullable))\r\n```\r\n\r\nRespecting the original nullability prevents issues when Spark depends on `ArrayType`'s `containsNull` being accurate. The example that uncovered this is calling `collect()` on the dataframe (see [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28818) for full repro). Though it's likely that there a several places where this could cause a problem. \r\n\r\nI've also refactored a small amount of the surrounding code to remove some unnecessary steps and group together related operations.\r\n\r\nNote: This is the backport PR of #25575 and the credit should be @MGHawes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI think it's pretty clear why this change is needed. It fixes a bug that currently prevents users from calling `df.freqItems.collect()` along with potentially causing other, as yet unknown, issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNullability of columns when calling freqItems on them is now respected after the change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a test that specifically tests the carry-through of the nullability as well as explicitly calling `collect()` to catch the exact regression that was observed. I also ran the test against the old version of the code and it fails as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement ALTER TABLE in JDBC Table Catalog\r\nThe following ALTER TABLE are implemented:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMNS ( column_name datatype [ , ... ] );\r\nALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;\r\nALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;\r\nALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name TYPE new_type;\r\nALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;\r\n```\r\nI haven't checked ALTER TABLE syntax for all the databases yet. I will check. If there are different syntax, I will have a follow-up to override the dialect. \r\n\r\nSeems most of the databases don't support updating comments and column position, so I didn't implement UpdateColumnComment and UpdateColumnPosition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nComplete the JDBCTableCatalog implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n`JDBCTableCatalog.alterTable`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd new

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new `dropFields` method to the `Column` class. \r\nThis method should allow users to drop a `StructField` in a `StructType` column (with similar semantics to the `drop` method on `Dataset`). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOften Spark users have to work with deeply nested data e.g. to fix a data quality issue with an existing `StructField`. To do this with the existing Spark APIs, users have to rebuild the entire struct column. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have the following deeply nested data structure which has a data quality issue (`5` is missing): \r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n\r\nval data = spark.createDataFrame(sc.parallelize(\r\n      Seq(Row(Row(Row(1, 2, 3), Row(Row(4, null, 6), Row(7, 8, 9), Row(10, 11, 12)), Row(13, 14, 15))))),\r\n      StructType(Seq(\r\n        StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n          StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n          StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))), \r\n            StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n          ))), \r\n          StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n        )))))).cache\r\n\r\ndata.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------+                                             \r\n|a                                |\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4,, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]|\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nCurrently, to drop the missing value users would have to do something like this: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", \r\n  struct(\r\n    $\"a.a\", \r\n    struct(\r\n      struct(\r\n        $\"a.b.a.a\", \r\n        $\"a.b.a.c\"\r\n      ).as(\"a\"), \r\n      $\"a.b.b\", \r\n      $\"a.b.c\"\r\n    ).as(\"b\"), \r\n    $\"a.c\"\r\n  ))\r\n\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nAs you can see above, with the existing methods users must call the `struct` function and list all fields, including fields they don't want to change. This is not ideal as: \r\n>this leads to complex, fragile code that cannot survive schema evolution. \r\n[SPARK-16483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16483)\r\n\r\nIn contrast, with the method added in this PR, a user could simply do something like this to get the same result: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", 'a.dropFields(\"b.a.b\"))\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the second of maybe 3 methods that could be added to the `Column` class to make it easier to manipulate nested data. \r\nOther methods under discussion in [SPARK-22231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22231) include `withFieldRenamed`. \r\nHowever, this should be added in a separate PR. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nOnly one minor change. If the user submits the following query: \r\n```\r\ndf.withColumn(\"a\", $\"a\".withField(null, null))\r\n```\r\ninstead of throwing: \r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: fieldName cannot be null\r\n```\r\nit will now throw: \r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: col cannot be null\r\n```\r\nI don't believe its should be an issue to change this because: \r\n- neither message is incorrect\r\n- Spark 3.1.0 has yet to be released\r\n\r\nbut please feel free to correct me if I am wrong. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests were added.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes a test added in SPARK-32175(#29002).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThat test is flaky. It can be mitigated by increasing the timeout but it would rather be simpler to remove the test.\r\nSee also the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nConvert `NULL` elements of maps, structs and arrays to the `\"null\"` string while converting maps/struct/array values to strings. The SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.omitNestedNullInCast.enabled` controls the behaviour. When it is `true`, `NULL` elements of structs/maps/arrays will be omitted otherwise, when it is `false`, `NULL` elements will be converted to `\"null\"`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. It is impossible to distinguish empty string and null, for instance:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(Seq(\"\"), Seq(null)).toDF().show\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|   []|\r\n|   []|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n2. Inconsistent NULL conversions for top-level values and nested columns, for instance:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select named_struct('c', null), null\").show\r\n+---------------------+----+\r\n|named_struct(c, NULL)|NULL|\r\n+---------------------+----+\r\n|                   []|null|\r\n+---------------------+----+\r\n``` \r\n3. `.show()` is different from conversions to Hive strings, and as a consequence its output is different from `spark-sql` (sql tests):\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select named_struct('c', null) as struct;\r\n{\"c\":null}\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select named_struct('c', null) as struct\").show\r\n+------+\r\n|struct|\r\n+------+\r\n|    []|\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. It is impossible to distinguish empty struct/array from struct/array with null in the current implementation:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq[Seq[String]](Seq(), Seq(null)).toDF.show()\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|   []|\r\n|   []|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, before:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(Seq(\"\"), Seq(null)).toDF().show\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|   []|\r\n|   []|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(Seq(\"\"), Seq(null)).toDF().show\r\n+------+\r\n| value|\r\n+------+\r\n|    []|\r\n|[null]|\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suite `CastSuite`.","created_at":"2020-07-30T18:22:40Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:27:36Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T12:03:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7c1ad9fda3874b7fa168122a7e7f34bfd6a8fcf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/39daa90e49645d04d13789eb284b46f69eaad6ee","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:nested-null-to-string","ref":"nested-null-to-string","sha":"39daa90e49645d04d13789eb284b46f69eaad6ee","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange casting of map and struct values to strings by using the `{}` brackets instead of `[]`. The behavior is controlled by the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.castComplexTypesToString.enabled`. When it is `true`, `CAST` wraps maps and structs by `[]` in casting to strings. Otherwise, if this is `false`, which is the default, maps and structs are wrapped by `{}`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To distinguish structs/maps from arrays.\r\n- To make `show`'s

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates the AQE framework to at least return one partition during coalescing.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates `ShuffleExchangeExec.canChangeNumPartitions` to not coalesce for `SinglePartition`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a bit risky to return 0 partitions, as sometimes it's different from empty data. For example, global aggregate will return one result row even if the input table is empty. If there is 0 partition, no task will be run and no result will be returned. More specifically, the global aggregate requires `AllTuples` and we can't coalesce to 0 partitions.\r\n\r\nThis is not a real bug for now. The global aggregate will be planned as partial and final physical agg nodes. The partial agg will return at least one row, so that the shuffle still have data. But it's better to fix this issue to avoid potential bugs in the future.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28916, this change also fix some perf problems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCRAN check fails due to the size of the generated PDF docs as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n WARNING\r\n‘qpdf’ is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs\r\n...\r\nStatus: 1 WARNING, 1 NOTE\r\nSee\r\n  ‘/home/runner/work/spark/spark/R/SparkR.Rcheck/00check.log’\r\nfor details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to install `qpdf` in GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nNote that I cannot reproduce in my local with the same R version so I am not documenting it for now.\r\n\r\nAlso, while I am here, I piggyback to install SparkR when the module includes `sparkr`. it is rather a followup of SPARK-32491.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix SparkR CRAN check failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions will test it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR, proposed a trade-off that can also support multi column to perform hash lookup in buildSide, but required buildSide with extra duplicate data, the duplication would be 2^numKeys - 1, for example, if we are to support NAAJ with 3 column join key, the buildSide would be expanded into (2^3 - 1) times, 7X.\r\n\r\nFor example, if there is a UnsafeRow key (1,2,3)\r\nIn NullAware Mode, it should be expanded into 7 keys with extra C(3,1), C(3,2) combinations, within the combinations, we duplicated these record with null padding as following.\r\n\r\nOriginal record\r\n\r\n(1,2,3) \r\n\r\nExtra record to be appended into HashedRelation\r\n\r\n(null, 2, 3) (1, null, 3) (1, 2, null)\r\n(null, null, 3) (null, 2, null) (1, null, null))\r\n\r\nwith the expanded data we can extract a common pattern for both single and multi column. allNull refer to a unsafeRow which has all null columns.\r\n\r\n* buildSide is empty input => return all rows\r\n* allNullColumnKey Exists In buildSide input => reject all rows\r\n* if streamedSideRow.allNull is true => drop the row\r\n* if streamedSideRow.allNull is false & findMatch in NullAwareHashedRelation => drop the row\r\n* if streamedSideRow.allNull is false & notFindMatch in NullAwareHashedRelation => return the row\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsidered that NAAJ in real production usage, the numKeys should not be that big, normally 1~3 keys, I think it's still worth to do such trade-off. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. SQLQueryTestSuite with NOT IN keyword SQL, add CONFIG_DIM with spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin on and off\r\n2. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.JoinSuite.\r\n3. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.SubquerySuite.\r\n4. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.HashedRelationSuite to make sure the data expand logical.\r\n5. config combination against e2e test (both single and multi column cases) with following\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"sspark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to manually install R instead of using `setup-r` which seems broken. Currently, GitHub Actions uses its default R 3.4.4 installed, which we dropped as of SPARK-32073.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here, I am also upgrading R version to 4.0. Jenkins will test the old version and GitHub Actions tests the new version. AppVeyor uses R 4.0 but it does not check CRAN which is important when we make a release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo recover GitHub Actions build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up issue of [SPARK-32290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32290).\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-32290, We only support Single Column NAAJ because of the complexity of Multi Column support, See. http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol2/vldb09-423.pdf Section 6. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, proposed a trade-off that can also support multi column to perform hash lookup in buildSide, but required buildSide with extra duplicate data, the duplication would be 2^numKeys - 1, for example, if we are to support NAAJ with 3 column join key, the buildSide would be expanded into (2^3 - 1) times, 7X.\r\n\r\nFor example, if there is a UnsafeRow key (1,2,3)\r\nIn NullAware Mode, it should be expanded into 7 keys with extra C(3,1), C(3,2) combinations, within the combinations, we duplicated these record with null padding as following.\r\n\r\nOriginal record\r\n\r\n(1,2,3) \r\n\r\nExtra record to be appended into HashedRelation\r\n\r\n(null, 2, 3) (1, null, 3) (1, 2, null)\r\n(null, null, 3) (null, 2, null) (1, null, null))\r\n\r\nwith the expanded data we can extract a common pattern for both single and multi column. allNull refer to a unsafeRow which has all null columns.\r\n\r\n* buildSide is empty input => return all rows\r\n* allNullColumnKey Exists In buildSide input => reject all rows\r\n* if streamedSideRow.allNull is true => drop the row\r\n* if streamedSideRow.allNull is false & findMatch in NullAwareHashedRelation => drop the row\r\n* if streamedSideRow.allNull is false & notFindMatch in NullAwareHashedRelation => return the row\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsidered that NAAJ in real production usage, the numKeys should not be that big, normally 1~3 keys, I think it's still worth to do such trade-off. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. SQLQueryTestSuite with NOT IN keyword SQL, add CONFIG_DIM with spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin on and off\r\n2. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.JoinSuite.\r\n3. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.SubquerySuite.\r\n4. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.HashedRelationSuite to make sure the data expand logical.\r\n5. config combination against e2e test (both single and multi column cases) with following\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"sspark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"true\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"true\",\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip SparkR installation that is to run R linters (see SPARK-8505) in the test-only mode at `dev/run-tests.py` script.\r\n\r\nAs of SPARK-32292, the test-only mode in `dev/run-tests.py` was introduced, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/run-tests.py --modules sql,core\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich only runs the relevant tests and does not run other tests such as linters. Therefore, we don't need to install SparkR when `--modules` are specified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions build is currently failed as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: this R is version 3.4.4, package 'SparkR' requires R >= 3.5\r\n[error] running /home/runner/work/spark/spark/R/install-dev.sh ; received return code 1\r\n##[error]Process completed with exit code 10.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reasons, looks GitHub Actions started to have R 3.4.4 installed by default; however, R 3.4 was dropped as of SPARK-32073.  When SparkR tests are not needed, GitHub Actions still builds SparkR with a low R version and it causes the test failure.\r\n\r\nThis PR partially fixes it by avoid the installation of SparkR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions tests should run to confirm this fix is correct.","created_at":"2020-07-30T07:32:25Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:06:04Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T10:28:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33759c7bb8458636f2f3efa723a0ff133c23606a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b831229bd25b9d4e127c37a65bb7040baedc41c3","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:install-r","ref":"install-r","sha":"b831229bd25b9d4e127c37a65bb7040baedc41c3","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSo far, we fixed many stuffs in `core` module. This PR fixes the remaining UT failures in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n- `OneApplicationResource.environmentInfo` will return a deterministic result for `sparkProperties`, `hadoopProperties`, `systemProperties`, and `classpathEntries`.\r\n- `SubmitRestProtocolSuite` has Scala 2.13 answer in addition to the existing Scala 2.12 answer, and uses the expected answer based on the Scala runtime version. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, `environmentInfo` is changed, but this fixes the indeterministic behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Scala 2.13: Do the following.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl core --am -Pscala-2.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\nTests: succeeded 2612, failed 3, canceled 1, ignored 8, pending 0\r\n*** 3 TESTS FAILED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to update `SqlBse.g4` for avoiding generating unused code.\r\nCurrently, ANTLR generates unused methods and variables; `isValidDecimal` and `isHint` are only used in the generated lexer. This PR changed the code to use `@parser::members` and `@lexer::members` to avoid it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo reduce unnecessary code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #29278, but with allowing to create `SparkContext` in executors by default.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a config to switch allow/disallow to create `SparkContext` in executors.\r\n\r\n- `spark.driver.allowSparkContextInExecutors`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome users or libraries actually create `SparkContext` in executors.\r\nWe shouldn't break their workloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will be able to disallow to create `SparkContext` in executors with the config disabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMore tests are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `java.ws.rs.NotFoundException` from two problematic `import` statements. All the other use cases are correct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn `StagesResource` and `OneApplicationResource`, there exist two `NotFoundException`s.\r\n- javax.ws.rs.NotFoundException\r\n- org.apache.spark.status.api.v1.NotFoundException\r\n\r\nTo use `org.apache.spark.status.api.v1.NotFoundException` correctly, we should not import `java.ws.rs.NotFoundException`. This causes UT failures in Scala 2.13 environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656 only support use FILTER clause on aggregate expression without DISTINCT.\r\nThis PR will enhance this feature when one or more DISTINCT aggregate expressions which allows the use of the FILTER clause.\r\nSuch as:\r\n```\r\nselect sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect count(id) filter (where class_id =

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `spark.createDataFrame(pdf: pd.DataFrame)`, the pdf will be sliced to `num_slices=defaultParallelism` slices before converting to arrow batches. However, the current logic may result in fewer partitions than specified. See the next section for details.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaced the slicing logic with the silimar logic as in [ParallelCollectionRDD.scala#L125](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/ParallelCollectionRDD.scala#L125)\r\n~~~python\r\n# replace conversion.py#L417-418\r\n# step = -(-len(pdf) // self.sparkContext.defaultParallelism)  # round int up\r\n# pdf_slices = (pdf.iloc[start:start + step] for start in xrange(0, len(pdf), step))\r\npdf_slices = (pdf.iloc[i * length // num_slices: (i + 1) * length // num_slices] for i in xrange(0, num_slices))\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#### Problem\r\nCurrently, in [conversion.py#L418](https://github.com/databricks/runtime/blob/84a952313ae73e3df32f065eb00cc0bcb024af14/python/pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py#L418|https://github.com/databricks/runtime/blob/84a952313ae73e3df32f065eb00cc0bcb024af14/python/pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py#L418), the slicing logic may result in fewer partitions than specified.\r\n###### Example:\r\n\r\nAssume:\r\n```\r\nlength = 100 -> [0, 1, ..., 99]\r\nnum_slices = 99 = self.sparkContext.defaultParallelism\r\n```\r\n**Old method:**\r\n\r\nstep = math.ceil(length / num_slices) = 2\r\nstart = i * step, end = (i + 1) * step:\r\noutput: [0,1] [2,3] [4,5] ... [98,99] -> 50 slices != num_slices\r\n\r\n**New method:**\r\n\r\nstart = i * length // num_slices, end = (i + 1) * length // num_slices:\r\noutput: [0] [1] [2] ... [98,99] -> 99 slices\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUse existing tests.","created_at":"2020-07-29T10:22:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-30T08:52:53Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T08:52:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0231d2692e25bb7119a39ff5d35556237731a6fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef9f646ca795af99b7b395290e2aec1e3b1dd36b","head":{"label":"liangz1:pdf-slicing","ref":"pdf-slicing","sha":"ef9f646ca795af99b7b395290e2aec1e3b1dd36b","user":{"login":"liangz1","id":7851093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTEwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7851093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263092270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMwOTIyNzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"liangz1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liangz1","id":7851093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTEwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7851093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liangz1/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to:\r\n\r\n1. Fix the error message when the output schema is misbatched with R DataFrame from the given function. For example,\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n    df <- createDataFrame(list(list(a=1L, b=\"2\")))\r\n    count(gapply(df, \"a\", function(key, group) { group }, structType(\"a int, b int\")))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **Before:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Error in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn) :\r\n      ... \r\n      java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException\r\n\t    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **After:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Error in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn) :\r\n     ...\r\n     java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Invalid schema from gapply: expected IntegerType, IntegerType, got IntegerType, StringType\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Update documentation about the schema matching for `gapply` and `dapply`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show which schema is not matched, and let users know what's going

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `JsonProtocol.accumulablesToJson` deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `JsonProtocol.accumulablesToJson` is indeterministic. So, `JsonProtocolSuite` itself is also using mixed test cases in terms of `\"Accumulables\": [ ... ]`.\r\n\r\nNot only this is indeterministic, but also this causes a UT failure in `JsonProtocolSuite` in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. However, this is a fix on indeterministic behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the GitHub Action or Jenkins.\r\n- Scala 2.13: Do the following.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl core --am -Pscala-2.13 -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.util.JsonProtocolSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n*** 1 TEST

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `ResourceAllocator.availableAddrs` deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, this function returns indeterministically due to the underlying `HashMap`. So, the test case itself is creating a list `[0, 1, 2]` initially, but ends up with comparing `[2, 1, 0]`.\r\n\r\nNot only this happens in the 3.0.0, but also this causes UT failures on Scala 2.13 environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this fixes the in-deterministic behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: This should pass the UT with the modified test case.\r\n- Scala 2.13: This can be tested like the following (at least `JsonProtocolSuite`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl core --am -Pscala-2.13 -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.JsonProtocolSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n*** 2 TESTS FAILED ***\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\nAll

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #28986.\r\nThis PR adds a config to switch allow/disallow to create `SparkContext` in executors.\r\n\r\n- `spark.driver.allowSparkContextInExecutors`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome users or libraries actually create `SparkContext` in executors.\r\nWe shouldn't break their workloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will be able to create `SparkContext` in executors with the config enabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMore tests are added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-29T01:51:53Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T01:29:14Z","closed_at":"2020-07-31T08:28:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"496cc2b6414ab688b1d135df360d89ed4e416460","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ea7ea956b3867b67c869fddcc294cb268157a92","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-32160/add_configs","ref":"issues/SPARK-32160/add_configs","sha":"0ea7ea956b3867b67c869fddcc294cb268157a92","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_u

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes the total task result size check for shuffle map stage tasks, as these tasks return map status and metrics, which will not be cached on the driver and thus will not crash the driver.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nChecking total task result size for shuffle map stage tasks would lead to erroring normal jobs which create a big number of tasks even if the job eventually does not return a large dataset.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpgrade codehaus maven build helper to allow people to specify a time during the build to avoid snapshot artifacts with different version strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDuring builds of snapshots the maven may assign different versions to different artifacts based on the time each individual sub-module starts building.\r\n\r\nThe timestamp is used as part of the version string when run `maven deploy` on a snapshot build. This results in different sub-modules having different version strings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual build while specifying the current time, ensured the time is consistent in the sub components.\r\n\r\nOpen question: Ideally I'd like to backport this as well since it's sort of a bug fix and while it does change a dependency version it's not one that is propagated.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhile I'm implementing SPARK-32032 I've found a bug in Kafka: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10318. This will cause issues only later when it's fixed but it would be good to fix it now because SPARK-32032 would like to bring in `AdminClient` where the code blows up with the mentioned `ConfigException`. This would reduce the code changes in the mentioned jira. In this PR I've changed `default.api.timeout.ms` to `request.timeout.ms` which fulfils this condition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSolve later problems and reduce SPARK-32032 PR size.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-28T15:13:16Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T03:50:06Z","closed_at":"2020-07-31T05:52:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c24af577a35620146027c3ebd1b21318c1f7c232","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen https is enabled for Spark UI, an HTTP request will be redirected as an encoded HTTPS URL: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10238/files#diff-f79a5ead735b3d0b34b6b94486918e1cR312\r\n\r\nWhen we create the redirect url, we will call getRequestURI and getQueryString. Both two methods may return an encoded string. However, we pass them directly to the following URI constructor\r\n```\r\nURI(String scheme, String authority, String path, String query, String fragment)\r\n```\r\nAs this URI constructor assumes both path and query parameters are decoded strings, it will encode them again. This makes the redirect URL encoded twice.\r\n\r\nThis problem is on stage page with HTTPS enabled. The URL of \"/taskTable\" contains query parameter `order%5B0%5D%5Bcolumn%5D`. After encoded it becomes  `order%255B0%255D%255Bcolumn%255D` and it will be decoded as `order%5B0%5D%5Bcolumn%5D` instead of `order[0][dir]`.  When the parameter `order[0][dir]` is missing, there will be an excetpion from:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/status/api/v1/StagesResource.scala#L176\r\nand the stage page fail to load.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, we can try decoding the query parameters before encoding it. This is to make sure we encode the URL \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a UI issue when HTTPS is enabled\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to detect possible regression inside `SparkPlan`. To achieve this goal, this PR added a base test suite called  `PlanStabilitySuite`. The basic workflow of this test suite is similar to  `SQLQueryTestSuite`. It also uses `SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES` to decide whether it should regenerate the golden files or compare to the golden result for each input query. The difference is, `PlanStabilitySuite` uses the serialized explain result(.txt format) of the `SparkPlan` as the output of a query, instead of the data result.\r\n\r\nAnd since `SparkPlan` is non-deterministic for various reasons, e.g.,  expressions ids changes, expression order changes, we'd reduce the plan to a simplified version that only contains node names and references. And we only identify those important nodes, e.g., `Exchange`, `SubqueryExec`, in the simplified plan.\r\n\r\nAnd we'd reuse TPC-DS queries(v1.4, v2.7, modified) to test plans' stability. Currently, one TPC-DS query can only have one corresponding simplified golden plan.\r\n\r\nThis PR also did a few refactor, which extracts `TPCDSBase` from `TPCDSQuerySuite`. So,  `PlanStabilitySuite` can use the TPC-DS queries as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNowadays, Spark is getting more and more complex. Any changes might cause regression unintentionally. Spark already has some benchmark to catch the performance regression. But, yet, it doesn't have a way to detect the regression inside `SparkPlan`. It would be good if we could detect the possible regression early during the compile phase before the runtime phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

API to convert epoch seconds to microseconds, \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n /**\r\n     * Equivalent to\r\n     * {@link #convert(long, TimeUnit) MICROSECONDS.convert(duration, this)}.\r\n     * @param duration the duration\r\n     * @return the converted duration,\r\n     * or {@code Long.MIN_VALUE} if conversion would negatively\r\n     * overflow, or {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} if it would positively overflow.\r\n     */\r\n```\r\nThis PR change it to `Math.multiplyExact(epochSeconds, MICROS_PER_SECOND)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nfix silent data change between 3.x and 2.x\r\n```\r\n ~/Downloads/spark/spark-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20200722   bin/spark-sql -S -e \"select to_timestamp('300000', 'y');\"\r\n+294247-01-10 12:00:54.775807\r\n```\r\n```\r\n kentyao@hulk 

change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, we will raise `ArithmeticException` instead of giving the wrong answer if overflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport skew handling on join that has one side with no query stage.\r\nThe join side with no query stage must be a side with bucket table scan, and we cannot split the bucket table. But we can duplicate the bucket side, just leverage the RDD mechanism, try to duplicate some parent partitions in the child RDD.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we have a RDD A with partitions (0, 1, 2, 3), and now we need duplicate the second partition (partition 1). We can just create a new RDD, B for example, with partition (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), and build the dependency relationship:\r\n- RDD B partition 0 <- RDD A partition 0\r\n- RDD B partition 1 <- RDD A partition 1\r\n- RDD B partition 2 <- RDD A partition 1\r\n- RDD B partition 3 <- RDD A partition 2\r\n- RDD B partition 4 <- RDD A partition 3\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn our production environment, there are many bucket tables, which are used to join with other tables. And there are some skewed joins now and then. While, in current implementation, the skew join handling can only applied when both sides of a SMJ are QueryStages. So skew join handling is not able to deal with such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDataTable is used in stage-page and executors-page for pagination and filter tasks/executors by search text.\r\nIn the current implementation, search text is saved so if we visit stage-page for a job, the previous search text is filled in the textbox and the task table is filtered.\r\nI'm sometimes surprised by this behavior as the stage-page lists no tasks because tasks are filtered by the previous search text.\r\nI think, it's not useful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Search text is no longer saved.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew testcase with the following command.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Dguava.version=27.0-jre -Dtest.default.exclude.tags= -Dspark.test.webdriver.chrome.driver=/path/to/chromedriver \"testOnly org.apache.spark.ui.ChromeUISeleniumSuite -- -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis changes the test to ensure the executors are all the way up and accepting tasks before attempting to move on to decommissioning. This also sets the number of partitions based on the number of executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently if the tasks don't get scheduled on the executor which is chosen for decommissioning it can fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo test change only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan test in a loop on my

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR supports `WrappedArray` as `customCollectionCls` in `MapObjects`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis helps fix the regression caused by SPARK-31826.  For the following test, it can pass in branch-3.0 but fail in master branch:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntest(\"WrappedArray\") {\r\n    val myUdf = udf((a: WrappedArray[Int]) =>\r\n      WrappedArray.make[Int](Array(a.head + 99)))\r\n    checkAnswer(Seq(Array(1))\r\n      .toDF(\"col\")\r\n      .select(myUdf(Column(\"col\"))),\r\n      Row(ArrayBuffer(100)))\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-31826, we've changed the catalyst-to-scala converter from `CatalystTypeConverters` to `ExpressionEncoder.deserializer`. However, `CatalystTypeConverters` supports `WrappedArray` while `ExpressionEncoder.deserializer` doesn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo,  SPARK-31826 is merged into master and branch-3.1, which haven't been released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test for `WrappedArray` in `UDFSuite`; Also updated `ObjectExpressionsSuite` for `MapObjects`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-27T13:19:15Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T03:21:13Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T12:24:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa4315b4934278d1e71184a35c1dcd67ed4923d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6b5a2095bf811d67bbc7f9154e7336c25d779c3","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-wrappedarray","ref":"fix-wrappedarray","sha":"a6b5a2095bf811d67bbc7f9154e7336c25d779c3","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using dynamic partition overwrite, each task has its working dir under staging dir like `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}`, each task commits to `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}/{partitionId}/part-{taskId}-{jobId}{ext}`.\r\nWhen speculation enable, multiple task attempts would be setup for one task, **they have same task id and they would commit to same file concurrently**. Due to host done or node preemption, the partly-committed files aren't cleaned up, a FileAlreadyExistsException would be raised in this situation, resulting in job failure.\r\n\r\nI don't try to change task commit process for dynamic partition overwrite, like adding attempt id to task working dir for each attempts and committing to final output dir via a new outputCommitCoordinator, here is reason:\r\n\r\n1. `FileOutputCommitter` already has commit coordinator for each task attempts, we can leverage it rather than build a new one.\r\n2. To say the least, we implement a coordinator solving task attempts commit conflict, suppose a severe case, application master failover, tasks with same attempt id and same task id would commit to same files, the `FileAlreadyExistsException` risk still exists\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I leverage FileOutputCommitter to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n1. when initing a write job description, set `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}` as the output dir\r\n2. each task attempt writes output to `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}/_temporary/${appAttemptId}/_temporary/${taskAttemptId}/{partitionId}/part-{taskId}-{jobId}{ext}`\r\n3. leverage `FileOutputCommitter` coordinator, write job firstly commits output to `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}/{partitionId}`\r\n4. for dynamic partition overwrite, write job finally move `stagingDir/.spark-staging-{jobId}/{partitionId}` to `finalPath/{partitionId}`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this pr, dynamic partition overwrite would fail\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPR #26548 means that RecordBinaryComparator now uses big endian\r\nbyte order for long comparisons. However, this means that some of\r\nthe constants in the regression tests no longer map to the same\r\nvalues in the comparison that they used to.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the tests does a comparison between\r\nLong.MIN_VALUE and 1 in order to trigger an overflow condition that\r\nexisted in the past (i.e. Long.MIN_VALUE - 1). These constants\r\ncorrespond to the values 0x80..00 and 0x00..01. However on a\r\nlittle-endian machine the bytes in these values are now swapped\r\nbefore they are compared. This means that we will now be comparing\r\n0x00..80 with 0x01..00. 0x00..80 - 0x01..00 does not overflow\r\ntherefore missing the original purpose of the test.\r\n\r\nTo fix this the constants are now explicitly written out in big\r\nendian byte order to match the byte order used in the comparison.\r\nThis also fixes the tests on big endian machines (which would\r\notherwise get a different comparison result to the little-endian\r\nmachines).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe regression tests no longer serve their initial purposes and also fail on big-endian systems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests run on big-endian system (s390x).","created_at":"2020-07-27T10:48:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T16:11:24Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T16:11:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0432b81bf9444b32c258bcb6578036691f605205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29259/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29259/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29259/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5d2956015cbe2d0f73650fd2f1f369eaebbee114","head":{"label":"linux-on-ibm-z:fix-endian","ref":"fix-endian","sha":"5d2956015cbe2d0f73650fd2f1f369eaebbee114","user":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42882114,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjg4MjExNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"linux-on-ibm-z/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdates to tests to use correctly sized `getInt` or `getLong` calls.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe reads were incorrectly sized (i.e. `putLong` paired with `getInt` and `putInt` paired with `getLong`). This causes test failures on big-endian systems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests were run on a big-endian system (s390x). This change is unlikely to have any practical effect on little-endian systems.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-27T10:37:45Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T17:37:33Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T17:36:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27a8dbc23a317dbe78c7e3ccce7b5341d9f2e05c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ff698b12b5a6d5edecb223ae8df71042de7eb9c","head":{"label":"linux-on-ibm-z:fix-row","ref":"fix-row","sha":"3ff698b12b5a6d5edecb223ae8df71042de7eb9c","user":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42882114,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjg4MjExNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"linux-on-ibm-z/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCheck the Distinct nodes by assuming it as Aggregate in `UnsupportOperationChecker` for streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to fix 2 things here:\r\n\r\n1. Give better error message for Distinct related operations in append mode that doesn't have a watermark\r\n\r\nWe use the union streams as the example, distinct in SQL has the same issue. Since the union clause in SQL has the requirement of deduplication, the parser will generate `Distinct(Union)` and the optimizer rule `ReplaceDistinctWithAggregate` will change it to `Aggregate(Union)`. This logic is of both batch and streaming queries. However, in the streaming, the aggregation will be wrapped by state store operations so we need extra checking logic in `UnsupportOperationChecker`.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the SS union queries in Append mode will get the following confusing error when the watermark is lacking.\r\n```\r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:529)\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:527)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreSaveExec.$anonfun$doExecute$9(statefulOperators.scala:346)\r\n\tat scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.java:23)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.timeTakenMs(Utils.scala:561)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StateStoreWriter.timeTakenMs(statefulOperators.scala:112)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Make `Distinct` in complete mode runnable.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, the distinct in complete mode will throw the exception:\r\n```\r\nComplete output mode not supported when there are no streaming aggregations on streaming DataFrames/Datasets;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, return a better error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-27T09:32:21Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T06:57:41Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T05:01:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1d91663fd58b91ae5f6561880de3d6a487dba3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set the minimum Arrow version as 1.0.0 to minimise the maintenance overhead and keep the minimal version up to date.\r\n\r\nOther required changes to support 1.0.0 were already made in SPARK-32451.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nR side, people rather aggressively encourage people to use the latest version, and SparkR vectorization is very experimental that was added from Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\nAlso, we're technically not testing old Arrow versions in SparkR for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users wouldn't be able to use SparkR with old Arrow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions and AppVeyor are already testing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `GitHub Action` is broken due to `SparkR UT failure` from new Apache Arrow 1.0.0.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-07-26 at 5 12 08 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9700541/88492923-3409f080-cf63-11ea-8fea-6051298c2dd0.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update R code according to Apache Arrow 1.0.0 recommendation to pass R unit tests.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is pinning Apache Arrow version at 0.17.1 and I also created a PR to compare with this.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29251\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Apache Spark 3.1 supports Apache Arrow 0.15.1+.\r\n- Apache Arrow released 1.0.0 a few days ago and this causes GitHub Action SparkR test failures due to warnings.\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/spark/commits/master\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- [x] Pass the Jenkins (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29252#issuecomment-664067492)\r\n- [x] Pass the GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo different versions are used for the same artifacts, `exec-maven-plugin` and `scalatest-maven-plugin`. This PR aims to use the same versions for `exec-maven-plugin` and `scalatest-maven-plugin`. In addition, this PR removes `scala-maven-plugin.version` from `K8s` integration suite because it's unused.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will prevent the mistake which upgrades only one place and forgets the others.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins K8S

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `python3` instead of `python` inside `bin/pyspark`, `bin/find-spark-home` and `bin/find-spark-home.cmd` script.\r\n```\r\n$ git diff master --stat\r\n bin/find-spark-home     | 4 ++--\r\n bin/find-spark-home.cmd | 4 ++--\r\n bin/pyspark             | 4 ++--\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAccording to [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/), we have four different cases for `python` while `python3` will be there always.\r\n```\r\n- Distributors may choose to set the behavior of the python command as follows:\r\n      python2,\r\n      python3,\r\n      not provide python command,\r\n      allow python to be configurable by an end user or a system administrator.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, these scripts already depend on `find_spark_home.py` which is using `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.\r\n```\r\nFIND_SPARK_HOME_PYTHON_SCRIPT=\"$(cd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"; pwd)/find_spark_home.py\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Apache Spark 3.1 already drops Python 2.7 via SPARK-32138 .\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action.","created_at":"2020-07-26T19:48:02Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T01:44:10Z","closed_at":"2020-07-26T22:55:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13c32947449a2613ac95903dbf41023ca2497368","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982015569,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMDE1NTY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WINDOWS","name":"WINDOWS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01ac03b999f5fae9fc83665b35822a4be1c14ff2","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-FIND-SPARK-HOME","ref":"SPARK-FIND-SPARK-HOME","sha":"01ac03b999f5fae9fc83665b35822a4be1c14ff2","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7e0c5b3b539f208ef795d6848c34b52db2076a5c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache
