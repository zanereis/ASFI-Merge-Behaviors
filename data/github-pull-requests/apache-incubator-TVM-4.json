to this commit, the `image_exists` utility in `determine_docker_images.py` logged the full response for success, and the full HTTP error if an exception is caught.  However, this is the expected behavior when loading a docker image from `tlcpackstaging`, such as the current images tagged with `20240428-060115-0b09ed018`. Logging this fallback as an error makes it difficult to find the first actual error that occurred in CI.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates these logging statments `logging.info` and `logging.exception` to instead use

to this commit, the `shape` argument to `R.reshape` was required to either be an in-line `relax::ShapeExpr`, or a variable that had been bound to a `relax::ShapeExpr` within the current function.  As a result, shapes that were provided as function arguments or that were produced by another operation (e.g. `R.tensor_to_shape`) would unnecessarily trigger an error.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `VMBuiltinLower` pass to instead check that the argument has `relax::ShapeStructInfo`.\r\n\r\nCloses

to this commit, the Relax type produced by calling a TIR PrimFunc needed to be explicitly specified using the `out_sinfo` argument.  These output shapes are required in order to allocate output tensors during the `CallTIRRewrite` lowering pass.  However, specifying them explicitly, especially in hand-written functions, duplicates information that is already present in the `PrimFunc` signature, and introduces the potential for inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `MakeCallTIR` function to infer `out_sinfo` if not explicitly specified.  This inference uses the number of relax arguments to identify output parameters in the signature of the `PrimFunc`, which then become the return values from `R.call_tir`.  Currently, this inference of `out_sinfo` occurs when constructing the `relax::Call` object, after which the `out_sinfo` is always present in the Relax IR.","created_at":"2024-07-30T14:41:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T13:19:55Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T13:19:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0244403ae1afdae3aa312307dc427be60eefe9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yongwww","id":10205827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA1ODI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10205827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww","html_url":"https://github.com/yongwww","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fbd99599182476a7793a21e966f2cf3dffbbebc2","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:call_tir_infer_out_sinfo","ref":"call_tir_infer_out_sinfo","sha":"fbd99599182476a7793a21e966f2cf3dffbbebc2","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

:** Unary ops calculate the value during runtime which is costly. Since we are handling quantized data hence, it is better to pre compute the value during compile time (for 0 -256 value) and store in a Look Up Table which is accessed during the runtime.\r\n\r\n**Implementation :** This pass generates the Look Up Table for each unary op during compile time.

to this commit, the `relax.transform.RealizeVDevice` pass performed in-place update on expressions appearing in its input `IRModule`, overwriting their struct info.  In-place mutation of TVM's IR types is only legal when the scope has sole ownership of the IR object, such as through the `CopyOnWrite` functionality, and is not allowed when the object is shared.  As a result, applying `RealizeVDevice` would cause unexpected updates in unrelated expressions.  Most noticeably, the `IRModule` used as input to `RealizeVDevice` would have its variable erroneously updated.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the `RealizeVDevice` transform to remove all in-place mutation.  The same propagation rules are followed, with known `VDevice` annotations propagated forward from the output of `R.hint_on_device`, and propagated backwards from the input of `R.hint_on_device` if no such annotation already exists.\r\n\r\nCloses

to this commit, the `relax.transform.MergeCompositeFunctions` required the module to contain a single Relax function named `\"main\"`. Lack of this function would result in an error when `mod->GetGlobalVar(\"main\")` was called.  Presence of any other Relax function would cause an error, since they were not collected into the `CompositeGroupsBuilder`.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `MergeCompositeFunctions` to be indepedendent of the names of the Relax functions in an IRModule.  The transform now updates all Relax functions that do not have the `attr::kPrimitive` or `attr::kCodegen` attributes.\r\n\r\nCloses

to this commit, the regex used for pylint to identify dummy variables would correctly identify variables that start with an underscore (e.g. `_scale`), unless they have an underscore elsewhere in the name (e.g. `_scale_factor`).  This leads to false positives from pylint for unused variables, as prefixing a variable with an underscore should mark a variable as intentionally unused.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the regex in TVM's `pylintrc` to match the current default value for `dummy-variables-rgx`, to allow unused variables to be named with a leading underscore, even if they also contain another underscore.","created_at":"2024-07-26T18:29:35Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T15:46:46Z","closed_at":"2024-07-30T15:45:58Z","merged_at":"2024-07-30T15:45:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e88018c3a56ab378dd11410a662ed5c3da1f4df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/88f9f584902563b2fbb2f4ac58cf8c086737123a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ci_pylint_dummy_variable_regex","ref":"ci_pylint_dummy_variable_regex","sha":"88f9f584902563b2fbb2f4ac58cf8c086737123a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR solves a known issue with Lightweight Profiling (LWP) on Hexagon that we have fixed in our downstream repo and that I'd like to upstream for the community. The issue appeared with the operator maxpool. When using LWP it gave incorrect results (i.e. with the accuracy terribly bad).\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the LWP handler was forgetting to save p0 (used by the handler). This predicate register needs to be saved too, just like r0-r5, as it had been decided that it was the responsibility of the handler to save everything (even these theoretically caller-saved registers). Said differently, since it had been decided that calling the LWP handler would not follow the normal ABI, and that the LWP handler would save everything it touches (even normally caller-saved registers like r0-r15 and p0-3), then it absolutely needs to save the predicate registers too (in particular p0, which was causing the issue).\r\n\r\nThe issue appeared only with maxpool because it's the only one that had a state saved in p0 before calling the LWP handler. And this call destroyed the content of what it had saved, making it subsequently branch to different portions of the code.\r\n\r\nFix: Allocate 32 bytes (instead of 24 previously), in order to save p3:0, and I save those at the bottom of the stack. Restore it at the end of the LWP handler.","created_at":"2024-07-26T17:13:16Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T04:32:22Z","closed_at":"2024-07-28T04:32:22Z","merged_at":"2024-07-28T04:32:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"4330c110550242571da017a1b15ae0b765723ae8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c186f82ba6b4a2af9fb0c4325d6720fef92adf01","head":{"label":"FranckQC:main","ref":"main","sha":"c186f82ba6b4a2af9fb0c4325d6720fef92adf01","user":{"login":"FranckQC","id":89943638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQzNjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89943638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC","html_url":"https://github.com/FranckQC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":426412629,"node_id":"R_kgDOGWqKVQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"FranckQC/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FranckQC","id":89943638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTQzNjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89943638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC","html_url":"https://github.com/FranckQC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FranckQC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FranckQC/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `dtype` string used by `tvmjs.dump_ndarray_cache` was generated as `str(np_array.dtype)`. While this works in most cases, there are a few naming differences between TVM datatypes and numpy datatypes, such as `\"float8_e4m3fn\"` in Numpy being equivalent to `\"e4m3_float8\"` in TVM.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `dump_ndarray_cache` to check `DataType.NUMPY2STR` for the datatype string, allowing round-trip save/load of float8 arrays.","created_at":"2024-07-18T14:17:47Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T21:12:16Z","closed_at":"2024-07-18T21:12:13Z","merged_at":"2024-07-18T21:12:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"070546eb4afddab5725dd145358931e9dfcb90f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/94f061b4ef6eec16651f32d4227d1da79b231182","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmjs_check_datatype_numpy2str","ref":"tvmjs_check_datatype_numpy2str","sha":"94f061b4ef6eec16651f32d4227d1da79b231182","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

C++ pass iterates through the primfunc and finds if there is an if_then_else branch related to layout specific padding where we can leverage from assume statement, remove the extra branch and over-compute.\r\nThis pass works if the branch has the buffer present in its then_clause or else_clause for which buffer assumption exists. If there are intermediate buffers, then we need to inline the code to use the pass. This pass first parses the assume statement and then uses the information to simplify the expression in the then_clause and else_clause in then_condition_context and else_condition_context. It then decides to eliminate the branch if then_clause and else_clause evaluates to same value in then_condition_context (since then_clause will be true in this context and if else_clause is also evaluating to true then we can directly replace it with else_clause), it returns the then_clause if we are in the else_condition_context and then_clause and else_clause evaluates to same value.\r\n\r\nPlease find the image for reference

executor.","created_at":"2024-07-16T09:02:09Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T05:03:55Z","closed_at":"2024-07-16T20:22:00Z","merged_at":"2024-07-16T20:22:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"51d7c5e47a108b7d03036e6a1045aa8348f9562c","assignee":{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cbalint13","id":3974360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3974360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13","html_url":"https://github.com/cbalint13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbalint13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1b89c86b3560b9c3ede9ac3b61e6c896d153efde","head":{"label":"quic-sanirudh:support_running_existing_so_through_rpc","ref":"support_running_existing_so_through_rpc","sha":"1b89c86b3560b9c3ede9ac3b61e6c896d153efde","user":{"login":"quic-sanirudh","id":63797228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzk3MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63797228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh","html_url":"https://github.com/quic-sanirudh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406768097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY3NjgwOTc=","name":"tvm","full_name":"quic-sanirudh/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"quic-sanirudh","id":63797228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzk3MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63797228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh","html_url":"https://github.com/quic-sanirudh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/quic-sanirudh/tvm

Bug Fix\r\n\r\nIn the `TileWithTensorIntrin` function, when the `allow_padding` parameter is enabled, the original implementation inlines all consumer blocks. This behavior can lead to incorrect inlining of output blocks, causing issues with block shapes and dependencies. To ensure correct inlining operations, only non-output consumer blocks should be inlined.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- **Added Non-Output Block Check:** Before inlining consumer blocks, added a check to ensure only non-output blocks are inlined.\r\n  - Used the `tir::IsOutputBlock` function to determine if a block is an output block.\r\n  - Applied `sch->ComputeInline` only if the block is not an output block.\r\n\r\n### Specific Code Changes\r\n\r\n1. Modified the consumer inlining logic in the `TileWithTensorIntrin` function:\r\n   ```cpp\r\n   for (const auto& consumer : consumers) {\r\n     auto sref = sch->GetSRef(consumer);\r\n     if (!tir::IsOutputBlock(sch->state(), sref, tir::GetScopeRoot(sch->state(), sref, true)))\r\n       sch->ComputeInline(consumer);\r\n   }\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThese changes ensure that when padding is enabled, only non-output blocks will be inlined, maintaining correct block shapes and dependencies.

to this commit, there was no rule to simplify `x == x` into `True`.  In some cases, despite not having an explicit rewrite rule in `RewriteSimplifier`, the `RewriteSimplifier::CanProve` function would check if `x-x` simplifies to zero, relying on the rewrite rules used for `tir::Sub`.  However, the rule to rewrite `x-x` into zero was only enabled for `int32`, `int64`, and floating-point types, so relying on this behavior was inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the rewrite rules for both `tir::EQ` and `tir::Sub` to check for simplification of `x-x` or `x==x`, regardless of the datatype.  This change preserves the fast-path for index data-types, in which `int32` and `int64` expressions may be simplified without checking for side effects.  For all other dtypes, the cancellation only applies when evaluating `x` has no side effects.","created_at":"2024-07-15T21:02:35Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T14:09:36Z","closed_at":"2024-07-24T13:24:15Z","merged_at":"2024-07-24T13:24:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f0f301c6f6de7548c6b2026bcb51590e0881ac5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/474dfd1762f041dd5ef0ba6908c01047ec9be85a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_simplify_x_equals_x","ref":"tir_simplify_x_equals_x","sha":"474dfd1762f041dd5ef0ba6908c01047ec9be85a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`R.view` was legalized to extern call to `runtime.TVMArrayCreateView` during `LegalizeOps`. This call to extern func can't be properly handled by `StaticBlockPlanMemory` because it assumes the extern func does not retain the input buffer. Extern func returning a view of the input would break the ref count of the buffer. This PR defers the legalization of `R.view` so that it can be explicitly handled by memory planning.\r\n\r\nA new op `R.ensure_aligned` is added as discussed in #16955 \r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @yongwww

to this commit, TVM could only be imported if the current directory had write privileges.  This was due to the use of `tvm.contrib.pickle_memoize` to cache the winograd transformation matrices.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes multiple related fixes, to ensure that (1) TVM can be imported regardless of directory permissions, (2) the working directory is not left in a cluttered state, and (3) cache files are generated in an expected location to be reused later.\r\n\r\n* The cache directory is only generated when required, just prior to saving a cache.\r\n\r\n* The cache directory defaults to `$HOME/.cache/tvm/pkl_memoize`, rather than `.pkl_memorize_py3` in the working directory.\r\n\r\n* The cache directory respects `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, using `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tvm/pkl_memoize` if set.","created_at":"2024-07-08T13:10:37Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T21:03:51Z","closed_at":"2024-07-15T17:54:05Z","merged_at":"2024-07-15T17:54:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"b654852b155d667a0c86adc8ff92d5eb7ca2c44b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"csullivan","id":4804563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4804563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/csullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4bacbf6a7d35ad7284084a59646dc9333af7d91a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_import_tvm_in_read_only_dir","ref":"bugfix_import_tvm_in_read_only_dir","sha":"4bacbf6a7d35ad7284084a59646dc9333af7d91a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, a `tvm::NameSupply` needed to be constructed with an explicit `const String& prefix` argument.  Omitting this argument would fall back to the default constructor provided by the `TVM_DEFINE_MUTABLE_OBJECT_REF_METHODS` macro, producing a `NameSupply` holding a nullptr.  This then leads to a segfault when the null `NameSupply` is used.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of usages of `NameSupply::NameSupply` (29 out of 31) initialize it with an empty `prefix` string.  The remaining two use cases initialize it with a non-empty `prefix` string.  There are no cases in which a null `NameSupply` is initialized.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `NameSupply` to use the `TVM_DEFINE_MUTABLE_NOTNULLABLE_OBJECT_REF_METHODS` macro instead of `TVM_DEFINE_MUTABLE_OBJECT_REF_METHODS`.  This allows the default constructor to provide the common usage of a `NameSupply` with an empty prefix, rather than the error-prone usage of a null `NameSupply`\r\n\r\nA similar change is also made for `GlobalVarSupply`, as the majority of its uses also default to an empty prefix (11 out of 13).","created_at":"2024-07-03T15:11:44Z","updated_at":"2024-07-14T11:39:06Z","closed_at":"2024-07-12T23:41:58Z","merged_at":"2024-07-12T23:41:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"f60b08c9a421d24c7627038064526b5cd7e2610a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bef5b22a5db03b28e964ad9186249418adce2269","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:qol_default_constructor_for_name_supply","ref":"qol_default_constructor_for_name_supply","sha":"bef5b22a5db03b28e964ad9186249418adce2269","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

currently only support lower cross thread with several constrains. For example, the lower_cross_thread only apples when the thread binding reduced axis is the innermost loop, and the block must have an init block. This can be a limiting for some cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, when tensorizing the reduction block (e.g., dp4a or mma), it becomes difficult to tensorize the init statement as well:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith T.block(\"block\"):\r\n    vi = T.axis.spatial(2, i_0 * 16 + i_1)\r\n    vk = T.axis.reduce(32, k_0 * 64 + k_1)\r\n    T.where(i_0 * 16 + i_1 < 2 and k_0 * 64 + k_1 < 32)\r\n    T.reads(A[vi, vk])\r\n    T.writes(B[vi])\r\n    with T.init():\r\n        B[vi] = T.float32(0)\r\n    B[vi] = B[vi] + A[vi, vk]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, certain cases, like small gemm, prefer block reduction in shared memory to enhance parallelization to better utilize the hardware resources.\r\n\r\nThis pull request improves the `lower_cross_thread` pass, it can now handle the thread block reduce lowering with separate init and reduce blocks, and removes the constrain that the reduced axis is the innermost loop to support TensorCore with block reduction.\r\n\r\nrelevant test cases can be found at `tests/python/tir-transform/test_tir_transform_lower_cross_thread_reduction.py`.\r\n\r\nPlease CC @MasterJH5574

to this commit, the `TVM_DEFINE_OBJECT_REF_COW_METHOD` could be used in any `ObjectRef` subclass to provide a `CopyOnWrite` method. However, the implementation of this method method was invalid if the object's `ContainerType` could itself be subclassed.  In that case, using `obj.CopyOnWrite()` when the object contains a subclass, and when a copy is required, would silently convert `obj` to instead contain a base class.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a `static_assert`, to the `TVM_DEFINE_OBJECT_REF_COW_METHOD` macro, preventing the macro from being used in classes that would have incorrect usage.\r\n\r\nCompilation with this change found two classes, `relax::Var` and `relax::BindingBlock`, that were susceptible to this error, and the macro has been removed from these classes.  For backwards-compatibility, the `CopyOnWrite` function for these two classes is provided explicitly.","created_at":"2024-07-01T19:32:39Z","updated_at":"2024-07-03T15:14:19Z","closed_at":"2024-07-02T15:18:08Z","merged_at":"2024-07-02T15:18:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"0df4103675a52cc5b9e6356cb003bb17c66bc1a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17132/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17132/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17132/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bc6b02dcfe3299db485aa2d2c4efdb4f9234fdd1","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_copy_on_write_requires_final","ref":"bugfix_copy_on_write_requires_final","sha":"bc6b02dcfe3299db485aa2d2c4efdb4f9234fdd1","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, TVMScript required the return value of a Relax to be specified outside of any `with R.dataflow()` blocks.  This resulted in a common pattern, where the return value of a function was first called with `R.output(ret_value)`, to mark `ret_value` as a `tvm::relax::Var` instead of a `tvm::relax::DataflowVar`, followed immediately by a `return ret_value` statement.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the TVMScript parser to allow a `return` statement inside a `with R.dataflow()` block.  This is syntactic sugar that is equivalent to calling `R.output`, followed by a `return`.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the following two TVMScript examples are now equivalent.  (Prior to this change, the `return_inside_dataflow` example would raise an error during parsing.)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function(private=True)\r\ndef output_then_return(A: R.Tensor):\r\n    with

we found a kind of corner bad cases for reverse inline primitive. Currently we encode predicate produced by inlining as block compute body, like\r\n```python\r\nwith T.block():\r\n    if pred:\r\n        body()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile other primitives (typically `cache_write`) currently may only respect the predicate of `T.where` for region estimation. The newly created blocks take the risk of region out-of-bound write accesses, lead to segfaults even in cpu target computations.\r\n\r\nThe change proposes to use equavalent `T.where` when possible to make it more consistent with s-tir system, like\r\n```python\r\nwith T.block():\r\n    T.where(pred_on_loop_vars)\r\n

PR introduces the Dynamic Gradient Descent (DGD) Search algorithm for accelerating the auto-tuning process of GPU kernels within the Ansor/AutoScheduler framework. The DGD algorithm is designed to explore the search space more efficiently than the existing Genetic Algorithm-based approach. The following changes are included:\r\n\r\n1. **Dynamic Gradient Descent Search:**\r\n   - Implements a new search strategy that uses gradient descent in a multi-dimensional tile-space.\r\n   - Utilizes online measurements and proxy model to guide the search process.\r\n\r\n2. **Record Processor:**\r\n   - A new class to handle the processing and modification of measure records.\r\n   - Includes methods to extract and modify SP node coordinates.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is based on the algorithm described in the paper \"[Accelerated Auto-Tuning of GPU Kernels for Tensor Computations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3650200.3656626)\" presented at ICS'24.\r\n\r\nExperimental evaluation on a number of matrix-matrix multiplication and convolution kernels shows that the DGD algorithm achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in auto-tuning time while maintaining comparable code performance.\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\nTo use the DGD Search algorithm, instantiate the `DynamicGradientSearchTuner` class with the desired parameters and call the `dynamic_gradient_search` method.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n```python\r\ntuner = auto_scheduler.dynamic_gradient_search.DynamicGradientSearchTuner(task, log_file, tune_option)\r\ntuner.dynamic_gradient_search()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Experiments setup: \r\nThe experiments used the DGD Search algorithm with a time budget of 1 hour and full duration used by Ansor, comparing the performance achieved by Ansor after suggested trials. The models used for the evaluation were Bert, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2, with the following configurations based on the Apache blog [Introducing TVM Auto-scheduler (a.k.a. Ansor)](https://tvm.apache.org/2021/03/03/intro-auto-scheduler):\r\n\r\n- **Bert:** 12000 trials, running on an Nvidia RTX 4090 for 6 hours.\r\n- **ResNet-50:** 20000 trials, running on an Nvidia RTX 4090 for 10 hours.\r\n- **MobileNetV2:** 16000 trials, running on an Nvidia RTX 4090 for 7 hours.\r\n\r\n### Relative Performance of the DGD Search algorithm achieved in 1 hour and full duration used by Ansor\r\n\r\n| Networks      | Ratio (1 hour) | Ratio (full) |\r\n| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Bert          | 93.71%         | 100.15%       |\r\n| ResNet-50     | 90.46%         | 96.73%        |\r\n| MobileNetV2   | 95.08%         | 101.75%       |\r\n\r\nThis table presents the relative performance of the DGD Search algorithm with a 1-hour time budget compared to the full duration used by Ansor.

Introduce `input_axis_separator` in `relax.transform_layout` op for 2D input buffer to allow conversion of 2D buffers to 1D buffers. The conversion from 2D->1D is handled while lowering of `transform_layout` operator. \r\n- This is needed because once the tensor is converted into 2D via `axis_separator`, the `input_axis_separator` helps in identifying the buffers with 2 dimensions especially when the conversion is needed to 1D operation.\r\n- Also introducing support for `input_axis_separator` in `AlterOpImpl`

to this commit, an exception thrown during the capture of a cuda graph would result in `std::terminate` being called.  This commit updates the implementation of `\"vm.builtin.cuda_graph.run_or_capture\"` such that a thrown exception can be recovered from, and does not cause any changes to the state of TVM's cuda graph cache.\r\n\r\n- Call to `cudaStreamDestroy` was previously skipped, now moved to a RAII-style destructor in a `ScopedCUDAStream` class.\r\n\r\n- Call to `cudaStreamEndCapture` was previously skipped, end of cuda graph capture now performed as part of RAII-style destructor for `CUDACaptureStream` class.\r\n\r\n- Restoration of `CUDAThreadEntry::ThreadLocal()->stream` was previously skipped, now restored as part of RAII-style destructor for `CUDACaptureStream` class.\r\n\r\n- Previously, an error raised from `cudaGraphInstantiate` would leave the `capture_cache_` in an ill-formed state.  Now, the `capture_cache_` is only updated after a valid `CUDAGraphCapturedState` has been fully

is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15864, which added `LegalizeOps` to the default Relax build pipeline.  Since legalization may produce additional TIR PrimFuncs that require scheduling, the output of `LegalizeOps` typically must also be passed through `tir.transform.DefaultGPUSchedule()`.  This PR adds `DefaultGPUSchedule()` to the relax build pipeline to handle these cases.\r\n\r\nScheduled PrimFunc have the `\"tir.is_scheduled\"` attribute set to true, and are ignored by `DefaultGPUSchedule()`.  In addition, the `DefaultGPUSchedule` transform has no effect on non-GPU targets. Therefore, this change should only impact `tvm.relax.build` calls that previously resulted in an error due to unscheduled GPU functions, and should not have any impact on existing calls.","created_at":"2024-06-18T15:11:40Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:31:02Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T00:31:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"050392040b736f6b9ebb1f661e4ff66b4e87945a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17108/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17108/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17108/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6440310f000dbc79fe7273af48f8b7c0cfee6498","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_apply_default_gpu_schedule","ref":"relax_apply_default_gpu_schedule","sha":"6440310f000dbc79fe7273af48f8b7c0cfee6498","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

pull request aims to enhance model optimization by adding post optimization in MetaSchedule. The proposed approach involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Execution of MetaSchedule over an end-to-end model that requires optimization. \r\n2. Selection of the best implementation identified by MetaSchedule for the given model. \r\n3. Utilization of Droplet Search to exploit the selected candidate.\r\n\r\nBy using Droplet Search as a post optimization ([Droplet paper](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/publications/papers/DropletSearch.pdf)), we have been able to reduce the number of trials explored by MetaSchedule while still achieving faster kernel performance. We have observed this improvement on the following architectures: Nvidia A100, Nvidia 3080, AMD x86, and ARM A64FX. The results can be found in this report: [bennu paper](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~michaelcanesche/paper/bennu_meta_version.pdf)\r\n\r\nProposed Changes\r\n\r\n- Integration of Droplet Search as post optimization methodology.\r\n- Utilization of Droplet Search to exploit the best candidates identified by MetaSchedule.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces an exploitation phase leveraging the coordinate descent algorithm to MetaSchedule. By iteratively refining the best kernel identified by MetaSchedule, we achieve two key benefits:\r\n1. Reduced Sample Requirements: Coordinate descent search minimizes the number of samples MetaSchedule needs to discover high-performing schedules.\r\n2. Faster Kernels: The refined kernels exhibit improved execution speed compared to those found by MetaSchedule alone, even when it uses more samples.\r\n\r\nThus, this PR optimizes MetaSchedule along two crucial dimensions: search efficiency and kernel performance.\r\n\r\nTesting and Validation\r\n\r\nExtensive testing has been conducted to validate the efficacy and performance improvements achieved through the integration of MetaSchedule and Droplet Search. Benchmarking tests have been performed across Nvidia A100, AMD x86, and ARM A64FX architectures to assess the impact on kernel speed and search time reduction compared with 10,000 trials from MetaSchedule execution. These results are available in Section 3 of this manuscript: [paper](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~michaelcanesche/paper/bennu_meta_version.pdf)\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes\r\n\r\nThis pull request builds upon prior research and experimentation in model optimization. The proposed approach improves end-to-end models across diverse hardware platforms while still reducing MetaSchedule's search time.

to this PR, a TIR PrimFunc could return an `int64`, `float64`, or void.  Returning any other type, even if supported by TVM's FFI, would raise an exception during `MakePackedAPI`.  With this PR, string literals can be returned from TIR PrimFuncs.\r\n\r\nEnabling this TIR functionality requires a change to the TVM FFI.  Previously, a `TVMRetValue` holding a string would allocate a\r\n`std::string*` and store it to `value_.v_handle`.  This return value depends on the C++ runtime, and cannot be constructed on all backends that only require the C API.  With this commit, this is instead represented as a `const char*` in `value_.v_str`, matching the representation in `TVMArgValue`.  Unlike `TVMArgValue`, since p`TVMRetValue` may own its return value, two new member variables `void (*f_deleter_)(void*)` and `void* f_deleter_arg_`.  These are designed to be easy to call from a C API, and are set to a deleter function that will free the allocation (if required), and an argument to be passed into the deleter function.\r\n\r\nWith this new representation, the return value for different use cases would be set as follows:\r\n\r\n* Return string from C++ PackedFunc.  The backing allocation is made using `new std::string(std::move(value))`.  This heap allocation is stored in `f_deleter_arg_`, so that `f_deleter_` can then call `delete static_cast<std::string*>(arg)`.  Finally, `new_str->data()` is stored as `value.v_str`.\r\n\r\n* Return pointer to static string from C.  A pointer to the static string is stored in `v_str`.  Both `f_deleter_` and `f_deleter_arg_`are left with their default value of `nullptr`, indicating that the `TVMRetValue` does not need to free any memory on destruction.\r\n\r\n  This is the return value used by `T.ret(T.StringImm(\"my_string\"))` in a TIR PrimFunc.\r\n\r\n* Return pointer to heap allocation made in C.  Assuming the allocation is made using `malloc()`, a pointer to the heap allocation is stored in both `value_.v_str` and `f_deleter_arg_`. The `f_deleter_` is set to `free`, indicating that `free(f_deleter_arg_)` should be called when the `TVMRetValue` is destructed.\r\n\r\n  This functionality is possibly within the updated `TVMRetValue` API, but is not currently used.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds unit tests for the return of strings from compiled TIR PrimFuncs, when either running the function locally, or over a RPC

to this PR, a local RPC server could crash without any indication in the main process.

`PackedFunc` interface has arguments `int num_args` and `TVMValue* args`, which contain the number of arguments and a pointer to the array of arguments.  Prior to this commit, when implementing the `PackedFunc` interface for TIR `PrimFunc`s, the `MakePackedAPI` pass would always assert that the `args` pointer was not null.  However, the `args` pointer is allowed to be null if `num_args` is zero.  For example, this occurs when calling an RPC function with no arguments.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `MakePackedAPI` transform to only assert that `args` is non-null when `num_args` is greater than zero.","created_at":"2024-06-15T14:35:49Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T15:18:52Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T13:36:09Z","merged_at":"2024-06-18T13:36:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6fe2aa331613bd7e16ea41b9687ab1ca007f232","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17098/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17098/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17098/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8c86ee8531103a97cc82d36dd0ca2a60bf6b0586","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_call_rpc_function_with_zero_args","ref":"bugfix_call_rpc_function_with_zero_args","sha":"8c86ee8531103a97cc82d36dd0ca2a60bf6b0586","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `FAttrsGetter` was defined as a function that returned `Map<String, String>`.

`python/tvm/contrib/msc/core/transform/pattern.py`).\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the type signature of `FAttrsGetter` to match its usage, returning a `Map<String,

to the implementation of `Variant<...>` in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15672, functions that were polymorphic over an argument type would typically accept an `ObjectRef` argument, then downcast to an allowed type.  This delays the catching of an error, and can accidentally omit automatic conversions applied by the FFI.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates several locations using this pattern to instead accept a `Variant`, templated over the allowed types.  This enables C++ type checking for C++ callers, standardizes the type-checking in the FFI for non-C++ callers, and ensures that FFI type conversions are uniformly applied.","created_at":"2024-06-14T20:04:02Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T18:57:25Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T18:57:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4e0543e243c8f4a32723025965fe9765e7f21e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Hzfengsy","id":25500082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTAwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25500082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy","html_url":"https://github.com/Hzfengsy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f6ec97810f4967dc074eb4e2a804366efe8d99ee","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:variant_argument_instead_of_objectref","ref":"variant_argument_instead_of_objectref","sha":"f6ec97810f4967dc074eb4e2a804366efe8d99ee","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `Array::Map` member function could only be applied to nullable object types.  This was due to the internal use of `U()` as the default value for initializing the output `ArrayNode`, where `U` is the return type of the mapping function.  This default constructor is only available for nullable types, and would result in a compile-time failure for non-nullable types.\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces `U()` with `ObjectRef()` in `Array::Map`, removing this limitation.  Since all items in the output array are overwritten before returning to the calling scope, initializing the output array with `ObjectRef()` does not violate type safety.","created_at":"2024-06-14T19:46:34Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T20:51:24Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T20:08:38Z","merged_at":"2024-06-18T20:08:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"e520b9b1879c31883b6a7be0877e2910e39b6ac7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3b866d1b3e4c83f3e2891a169286abef3dd455ad","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:container_array_map_with_non_nullable_type","ref":"container_array_map_with_non_nullable_type","sha":"3b866d1b3e4c83f3e2891a169286abef3dd455ad","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
