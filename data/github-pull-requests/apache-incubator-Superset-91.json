SUMMARY\r\nWe have a new column on the report_schedule table that defaults timezone to \"UTC\". This pr reads that timezone from the report and then runs the cron schedule according to that schedule. In a future PR I will add in a UI that allows users to change that timezone and save different values to the report_schedule table, such as \"America/New_York\" or \"America/Los_Angeles\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWe want to make sure that all existing reports continue to run on UTC.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15830/ modified the `_get_csv_data` functionality in the reports executor to use a new chart API introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15827/. One problem is that the new API can only be called for charts that were saved with their `query_context`, a change that was introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15824.\r\n\r\nPre-existing charts have `query_context` set to null, so we can't use the new API with them. As a workaround, @hughhhh implemented logic to save `query_context` when a chart that doesn't have it saved is loaded (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15865). This PR leverages that work by taking a screenshot of the chart using Selenium whenever we need to call the CSV API but `query_context`  is null.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a chart, save.\r\n2. Delete `query_context` of the chart (`UPDATE slices SET query_context = NULL WHERE id=XXX`)\r\n3. Create a CSV report based on the chart\r\n4. Report with CSV should arrive correctly, and `query_context` should be back.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

It allows us to request the data for a given chart post-processed in the same way the visualization does in Javascript.\r\n\r\nEg, for this pivot table:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-22 at 12-00-06  DEV

(**unpivoted**) data.\r\n\r\nDoing a `GET` on \"http://localhost:9000/api/v1/chart/72/data/?format=json\" returns:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"result\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"cache_key\":

functionality was added to support a very small subset of visualization types:\r\n\r\n1. Pivot tables (v1)\r\n2. Pivot tables (v2)\r\n3. T-test tables\r\n\r\nBecause of the small number of visualization types, I opted to do this by reimplementing the chart logic in Python. The alternative would be to run the visualization under Selenium and scrape the data, which is inefficient and still requires keeping the scraping logic up-to-date with the plugins.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe bug was the consequence of different issues.\r\n\r\n#### Issue with `getDerivedStateFromProps`: \r\nThis PR removes the `getDerivedStateFromProps` introduced by PR #14493 that was causing the Collapse to not re-render when changing viz type as the new props were not propagated down to the render phase. The removal does not seem to affect the functionality for which that PR was made. @villebro your confirmation will be appreciated here.\r\n\r\n#### Issue with the Antdesign Collapse: \r\nThis problem seems related to a bug with Antdesign when multiple re-renders happen while the Collapse is opening up, causing the Collapse to render invisible (0 height). By forcing the rendering of a `Loading` component after changing the viz type/datasource, Antdesign is then able to properly render the Collapse.\r\n\r\nFixes: #15829\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/126671260-2cd0c0ab-30aa-4e8c-8fcc-8c65a7b84c2f.mov\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/126671313-c8ea5078-1baf-4e89-b961-3281ccb6548c.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a chart in Explore\r\n2. Go to the Customize tab and make sure it opens correctly\r\n3. Change viz type\r\n4. Go again to the Customize tab and make sure it opens correctly\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the reports executor to use the new CSV endpoint introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15827. This allows us to produce CSV reports from visualization types not defined in `viz.py`, like pie charts and the new pivot table.\r\n\r\nBefore the executor was using the `explore_json` endpoint, which is not supported for the new visualization types.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-21 at 17-10-19  DEV  Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/126575038-b090b2e6-007a-40f4-8c36-bb2200456681.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-21 at 17-09-09  Report  Test new CSV endpoint Pivot Table v2 - ralmeida gmail com - Gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/126575047-0e52fa0d-11ed-4a7c-b17d-3acd2dc15665.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-21 at 17-09-45  Report  Test new CSV endpoint Pivot Table v2 - ralmeida gmail com - Gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/126575049-4914d049-7a7c-4da2-ae09-fa0991cae25d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new API for retrieving data associated with a saved chart via a `GET` request.\r\n\r\nThe API uses the stored `query_context` (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15824) to run the query and fetch the data.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI accessed the endpoint manually by hitting http://localhost:9000/api/v1/chart/56/data/:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"result\": [\r\n

is null, and the case where it's present and data is returned.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new column to the `slices` table called `query_context`. It also modifies Explore to save the query context to this column whenever a chart is saved.\r\n\r\nHaving the query context is needed in order to generate data for a saved chart with the `api/v1/char/data` endpoint. Since the query context is built by each visualization from `slices.params` via Javascript, there's currently no way to fetch data for a given chart from Python.\r\n\r\nWith the new column we will be able to generate CSV reports for new (JS-only) charts, like the pivot table v2.\r\n\r\nThe migration script only adds the column, but doesn't populate it for existing charts since that would be too expensive and complex.\r\n\r\nMigration benchmark:\r\n\r\n```\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nCurrent: 0.26 s\r\n10+: 0.35 s\r\n100+: 0.30 s\r\n1000+: 0.22 s\r\n10000+: 0.22 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nSave a chart and check the `slices.query_context` column:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> SELECT params, query_context FROM slices WHERE

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA follow up to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15757#discussion_r674140292, per the Mypy [documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#more-function-signatures), \r\n\r\n> *args and **kwargs arguments can be annotated like so:\r\n>\r\n> ```python\r\n> def stars(*args: int, **kwargs: float) -> None:\r\n>    # 'args' has type 'Tuple[int, ...]' (a tuple of ints)\r\n>    # 'kwargs' has type 'Dict[str, float]' (a dict of strs to floats)\r\n>    for arg in args:\r\n>        print(arg)\r\n>    for key, value in kwargs:\r\n>        print(key, value)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nthough `kwargs` is a `Dict[str, ...]` the typing of `**kwargs` is actually the dictionary value type.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI. Found all violations by running `git grep \"**kwargs: Dict\"`. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe're trying to run the `downgrade` from `49b5a32daba5_add_report_schedules.py`, but the migration errors because the unique constraint `uq_report_schedule_name` is not found. The `upgrade` function in the migration has the creation of the constraint inside a permissive `try/except` block, so I'm assuming the upgrade partially failed for some reason and now we can't downgrade.\r\n\r\nI modified the migration to check if the constraint exists before deleting it. The change should be harmless, because in theory the constraint should always exist. But maybe we should adopt this as a more conservative approach for `downgrade`s in migrations.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen identifying models, the benchmark migration script should also take into consideration models that are referenced in foreign keys.\r\n\r\nFor example, running the script on `301362411006_add_execution_id_to_report_execution_.py` would identify a single model, for the `report_execution_log` table. But that table has a foreign key to `report_schedule.id`. On a particular run the script was failing because `report_schedule` was empty.\r\n\r\nI changed the script to also populate the models referenced in foreign keys. Ideally we'd need only 1 entity for each of those models, but for now the script generates multiple entities of them as well. I'll clean it up in a follow up PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nMake sure you have no reports scheduled. Run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% python scripts/benchmark_migration.py superset/migrations/versions/301362411006_add_execution_id_to_report_execution_.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nIdentifying models used in the migration:\r\n- ab_user (1 rows in table ab_user)\r\n- dashboards (12 rows in table dashboards)\r\n- slices (114 rows in table slices)\r\n- dbs (2 rows in table dbs)\r\n- report_schedule (0 rows in table report_schedule)\r\n- report_execution_log (0 rows in table report_execution_log)\r\n...\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nCurrent: 0.20 s\r\n10+: 0.37 s\r\n100+: 0.19 s\r\n1000+: 0.20 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user creates a new adhoc metric with drag and dropping a column into metrics control, auto fill default aggregate in metric popover.\r\nIf column's generic type is numeric, set `SUM` aggregate as default.\r\nif column's generic type is string or boolean, set `COUNT_DISTINCT` aggregate as default.\r\nOtherwise, don't set a default aggregate.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes a bug metrics popover - when user created a metric with a custom label and then tried to create next metric, previous label was set instead of a default label. Now it should work as expected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/126321084-c75a8fc2-40fa-4d66-bf32-3be7eefa6f4d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Set `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` and `UX_BETA` feature flags to True\r\n1. Drag numeric column to metrics control. The default aggregate should be `SUM`\r\n2. Drag string or boolean column to metrics control. The default aggregate should be `COUNT_DISTINCT`\r\n3. Drag other type of column to metrics control. Aggregate should be unset.\r\n4. Click Run and make sure the metrics work properly\r\n5. Edit the default label of some metric and then try to add a new one. A default label in the new metric popover should match column's name and selected aggregate. Previously set label shouldn't be shown here\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nThese changes add a new component for choosing timezones client side. It uses the timezone list from moment-timezone which has about 400 entries. To narrow that list for a UI dropdown, I have removed all duplicates (based on their standard and daylight timezone offsets). There is a map that makes some of these selections more readable; for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\" is a duplicate of Vancouver, so we map it to \"Pacific Standard/Daylight Time\". In a v2 I may see if there's a simple way to pull that name out of moment, but for now, there's a map of about 7-8 regions that seem to work. \r\nThere's a migration and some changes coming next that will implement this into reports. For now these changes should have no UI impact, and just introduce the component and storybook files. \r\n\r\nI also bumped a few packages to keep this compatible with the addition of moment-timezone which required a bump in typescript, etc. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nExample from storybook showing \"UTC\" being mapped to

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe currently use 2 libraries for retries/exponential backoff:\r\n\r\n-

week!).\r\n\r\nI chose to replace `retry` with `backoff`, since the latter is stable and actively maintained.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nBack in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8901 @villebro made changes to include `datasource.changed_on` to the chart cache key so that a change to the datasource would bust the chart cache. This was important because a user could change the sql for a datasource, but rerunning the chart wouldn't rerun the query before.\r\n\r\nIn this PR it seems like we intended to also bust the cache when metrics/columns were changed (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8901/files#r372541748) but that doesn't seem to work. This PR addresses that oversight and adds a test to check it\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI, new unit test\r\n\r\ncreate a chart, update a metric, see the chart's cache busted\r\n\r\n###

reverts commit 80b8df0673193e1a7ce1ec3c2c4c10c6b363097b.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe commit above fixes cases for virtual datasets where an alias for a column was created with quotes for snowflake, but it does not work for regular datasets where the columns have not been aliased. Reverting this change for now because it is less likely to have a chart that relies on a dataset with a named, quoted aliases, than it it to be using an unquoted alias or a table. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\ncreate a dataset or virtual dataset and try to create a chart from it\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\nAdds timezone to report schedule db in order to allow us to add a UI on the reports for users to select a timezone for their schedule. Timezones are strings of locations, such as \"America/Los_Angeles\" or \"UTC\".\r\n\r\nThe default value of UTC as an example will be GMT, which is the current +0 offset time that we are using. \r\n\r\nIn the future UI, the plan is to \"guess\" the user's timezone and default the selection to their current timezone.

SUMMARY\r\nBumps `@superset-ui/plugin-chart-pivot-table` to version `0.17.68`. This change will introduce conditional formatting, d3 formatting of metrics from dataset, date formatting, combining metrics and new expand/collapse icons for pivot table. For details, see https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1217\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nSee videos in https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1217\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nConditional formatting: test behaviour described in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15651\r\n\r\nD3 formatting for metrics:\r\n1. Open Edit Dataset modal and set custom formatting for some saved metrics\r\n2. Create a pivot table with those metrics\r\n3. Verify that formatting from dataset has been applied\r\n4. Verify that formatting from dataset overrides formatting defined in Customize tab\r\n\r\nDate formatting:\r\n1. Create a pivot table, use temporal columns as row or column groups\r\n2. Verify that date formatting selected in Customize tab is applied correctly\r\n\r\nCombining metrics:\r\n1. Create a pivot table and check \"Combine metrics\" checkbox\r\n2. Verify that now metrics are used as the lowest level group rather than highest\r\n3. Verify that the feature works with Transpose pivot and applying metrics to rows instead of columns\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nImplements UX improvements for DnD, some of which are prerequisites for drag and dropping time columns.\r\nChanges include:\r\n- sorting columns in dataset panel so that temporal columns are displayed first (so that it's easy find them and drag to time column control)\r\n- making delete button in `DndColumnSelect` configurable - we don't display the delete button for time column control\r\n- changed logic of `canDrop` on single selection controls. Before in order to change the selection, user had to remove current selection and drop a new column/metric. Now when control field has a value, user can just drop a new value and it will get swapped\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/125949640-faa0f395-91dd-4cc2-baec-822ac48bbe8d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nInstructions for changes related to time column dnd will be described in a PR in superset-ui\r\nTo test the new behaviour of single select controls:\r\n0. Set `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` to True\r\n1. Open a chart that has controls that accept only a single value, e.g. Chord chart.\r\n2. Add values to control fields, then swap them without removing first\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nDue to incorrect handling of `multi: false` prop in `DndColumnSelect`, we sometimes passed an array of arrays of column names, when the chart was expecting an array of column names. Moreover, I noticed that sometimes when we create a chart and then change dataset, chart still tries to use some column names from the old dataset.\r\nThis PR fixes both issues.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15532\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/125910050-317b3f22-8ccd-4a42-b14d-06c01cb38421.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Set `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` to True\r\n1. Create a chart that uses controls that accept only single column, e.g. Chord\r\n2. Verify that chart is created correctly\r\n3. Change dataset and try to create a chart again\r\n4. Verify that there are no \"leftovers\" from previous dataset (before, sometimes chart tried to use column names from previous dataset even though they were removed from controls)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently when we run `load-examples` the examples DB is created with a random UUID. This makes it hard to move across instances datasets/charts/dashboards that reference the examples DB, since the UUID doesn't match.\r\n\r\nThis PR freezes the UUID of the examples DB.\r\n\r\nThere's one gotcha. If the user has created the examples DB **before** this PR, but runs `load-examples` **after** this patch we won't find the examples DB by searching for the frozen UUID. Instead, we need to search by name. This is how currently the `load-examples` process works. I kept the logic for when we can't find the examples DB via the UUID.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nLoaded examples:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ superset load-examples\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen checked the UUID of the examples DB created:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> SELECT uuid FROM dbs;\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n| uuid                               |\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n| 0xA2DC77AFE65449BBB32140F6B559A1EE |\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\r\n\r\nmysql>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR:\r\n- replaces react-icons with @react-icons/all-files in superset-ui packages to enable treeshaking of the unused icons\r\n- removes react-icons from Superset proper\r\n\r\nAs an example, spa.js goes from 7.62MB to 6.42MB \r\n\r\nNote that this pulls in some other changes from superset-ui, @kgabryje could you verify that these are fine to merge too?

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis will be one of the many PRs to address perf issues raised in #15518 .\r\n\r\nCurrently the Dashboard page will wait for both `datasets` and `charts` data to start rendering, however the datasets data are only used in filter indicators and filter boxes and should not block us from rendering other charts. In our case, the `datasets` endpoint is often much slower because we have a giant single-source-of-truth datasource with thousands of metrics and columns.\r\n\r\nUnblocking rendering from the datasets endpoint should speed up the page rendering a little bit. In our use case, it's often a matter of a full second.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to simply remove `datasources` from Dashboard state as that would involve letting the filter indicators and filter box fetching datasource metadata themselves.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nDashboard renders after `/datasets` is

`/dashboard/[id]/charts` are loaded:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/125715172-b6d614b3-3097-4dbb-9726-b51c28b04c29.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nGo to

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis allows us to keep Superset updated from a repo:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ superset import-directory /path/to/configs/\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, I created a simple dashboard with a single chart:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-14 at 11-08-02

unzipped it. After deleting the dashboard, chart, dataset, and database I imported everything back with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ superset import-directory ~/Downloads/dashboard_export_20210714T104600/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then changed the chart title in `~/Downloads/dashboard_export_20210714T104600/charts/Cnt_per_country_1.yaml` and ran the command again. The chart was succesfully updated:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-07-14 at 11-12-01 Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/125672259-62fb1e5f-f6dd-4b48-be13-438cd825b064.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n2 small fixes for our `Makefile`:\r\n\r\n1. `source venv/bin/activate` doesn't work within the Makefile, since `source` is a shell builtin. I fixed it by doing `. venv/bin/activate` instead.\r\n2. Superset only runs on Python 3.7 or 3.8 (some deps fail to install on 3.9). I added a check for the version.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe were using lazy translations on some of the SIP-40 error payloads, but they can't be serialized to JSON. I fixed the errors introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15482, and added (non-lazy) translation calls to a few error messages that were missing them.\r\n\r\nWhile testing, I also noticed that if we fail to sync the query to the backend because we couldn't save its state we never update it to failed. I changed the order of `then()`/`catch()` to ensure we show the error messages even if the state is not synced properly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, if we failed to store the state we would only show a toaster, and the query would keep polling even after a failure (note, the screenshot is not showing but a toaster shows up):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1904\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 2 31 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/125527997-1c1f4629-abda-40c2-981b-65c4f47d9fcf.png\">\r\n\r\nThe SIP-40 payload would not show because:\r\n\r\n1. We would not dispatch `QUERY_FAILED` if we failed to sync the state, swallowing the SIP-40 error message.\r\n2. The `GENERIC_BACKEND_ERROR` error was not registered to show the error in a component.\r\n\r\nAfter, once I changed the SQL Lab action to dispatch `QUERY_FAILED` after a failed sync, and once I registered the `GENERIC_BACKEND_ERROR` error:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1904\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 2 44 20 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/125529916-f4ac7f5a-b22e-4ba3-929f-5e206d8e1685.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI hardcoded `mydb = 0` to simulate an error in the `sql_json` endpoint, and ran a query.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---
