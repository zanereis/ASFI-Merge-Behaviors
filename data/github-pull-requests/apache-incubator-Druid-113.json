The test code we are using is a copy of what is in druid-io/druid/integration-tests with some local modifications and additions.  We would like, instead, to base our test code on jars made from what's in druid-io/druid/integration-tests.  To do so, we need some generalizations of the test support code.  This PR proposes those, and it also proposes an enhancement to one of the tests.\n\nWe do not run the tests using mvn.  That's because some of the test systems we use do not have access to the external internet, and in cases where they do have access, doing downloads can be prohibitively slow.  Instead, we run the tests by setting an appropriate classpath and executing \"java org.testng.TestNG\".  For this to work, we need to have the compiled code from both integration-tests/src/main and integration-tests/src/test on the classpath.  The code from main is available in druid-integration-tests-n.n.n.jar.  We'd like to enhance pom.xml to get a jar with the code from integration-tests/src/main.\n\nWe have a receiver firehose test that uses rejection policy serverTime and creates data events on the fly with current datestamps.  It sends events that are out of order (but within the window) and events that are outside (before) the window.  It does queries using the router.  I folded our test into ITRealtimeIndexTaskTest.\n\nThe test wants to build queries and expected results based on the timestamp, and drive the query test from a String instead of from the contents of a file.  I moved FromFileTestQueryHelper to TestQueryHelper, and gave it two functions for doing the query, one taking the String with the query information, the other taking the name of a file from which to read the String.  I also wanted to allow tests to query either the broker or the router, so I added a url parameter to the query functions.  (I left the broker as the default, for backward compatibility.)\n\nThe new version of ITRealtimeIndexTaskTest can't share resources with ITUnionQueryTest any more; I separated the resources.\n\nBecause we're sending data with current timestamps, we want to be able to unload and kill segments with timestamps other than in 2013.  I added an unloadAndKillData function that takes start and end timestamps as parameters.\n\nWe were seeing some tests fail because they were doing queries before all of the data was available.  Waiting until \"loadstatus?simple\" said 0 for the datasource of interest was not sufficient.  Experiments with the twitter query test showed that sometimes when loadstatus?simple showed \"twitterstream\":0, intervals?full showed only two of the three segments. At that point the test's queries were failing in a way that was consistent with two of the three segments being present.  After the intervals query showed all the segments present, the queries started passing.  If we wait until plain \"loadstatus\" says 100.0, all of the segments should be present.\n\nThe areSegmentsLoaded function is also used to determine when segments are not available any more after they are unloaded.  The change to areSegmentsLoaded() will not change the ability to use it for that purpose.\n\nWe are starting to have some tests that use additional configuration information.  I want to add a function getHistoricalHost() to the configuration classes, and a generic function getProperty() for other properties. (This PR changes the configuration file string for the middle manager because it was incorrect before.)\n\nWhen we run the wikipedia query tests, some of the queries often time out.  I increased the timeout value for some of the queries in wikipedia_editstream_queries.jon.\n\nWe have an integration test that uses the kafka firehose, and one that uses tranquility.  We hope to contribute those also, once some details are taken care of.

to be a side effect of using an intermediate IncrementalIndex to handle nested group bys. Fix is to prevent adding multiple columns with the same fieldName to the index. The AggregatorFactory type may be lost since it doesn't add subsequent factories with the same name, but I don't think that affects the function of the intermediate index.\n\nThis is a hack in the sense that the real solution is to re-write groupbys to not require massaging the data to work with IncrementalIndex.\n\nCloses

As already discussed here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-development/9O5NMo2-4WU I would also like some suggestions about the pom.xml as I'm having some difficulties in order to build druid along with the cloud-files extension. Here's my current working solution (from the root of the project):\n\n```\nmvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true\ncp -f services/target/druid-services-0.8.2-SNAPSHOT-selfcontained.jar /usr/local/druid/lib\njava \"-Ddruid.extensions.coordinates=[\\\"io.druid.extensions:druid-kafka-eight:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\\\",\\\"io.druid.extensions:mysql-metadata-storage:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\\\",\\\"io.druid.extensions:druid-cloudfiles-extensions:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\\\"]\" -Ddruid.extensions.localRepository=/usr/local/druid/repository \"-Ddruid.extensions.remoteRepositories=[\\\"file:///root/.m2/repository/\\\",\\\"http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/\\\",\\\"https://metamx.artifactoryonline.com/metamx/pub-libs-releases-local\\\"]\" -cp /usr/local/druid/lib/* io.druid.cli.Main tools pull-deps\ncd extensions/cloudfiles-extensions/\nmvn dependency:copy-dependencies \"-DoutputDirectory=/usr/local/druid/jclouds\"\ncd ../..\n```\n\nand then I run the various nodes:\n\n```\njava -Xmx512m -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp config/_common:config/coordinator:/usr/local/druid/lib/*:/usr/local/druid/jclouds/* io.druid.cli.Main

PR corresponds to the issue https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/1513\n\nDesign details -\n- The task priority is used for acquiring a lock on an interval for a datasource. Tasks with higher priority can preempt lower-priority tasks for the same datasource and interval if ran concurrently.\n  The flow for acquiring and upgrading Locks by a Task during TaskLifeCycle would be like -\n  - Check for TaskLocks on same datasource and overlapping interval\n    - If the one or more TaskLocks have same or higher priority then stop and retry after some time\n    - If no TaskLock is present or all the TaskLocks are of lower priority then check if any lock is an exclusive lock\n      - If no then revoke all the lower priority TaskLocks and create a new TaskLock\n      - If yes then stop and retry after some time\n  - Before publishing the segments, upgrade the TaskLock to exclusiveLock\n    - If upgrade successful publish the segment and return success status for the Task\n    - If no then return failure status for the Task\n\nTasks with no priority specified will have the respective default priorities as per the task type\n- Default priorities for task\n  - Realtime Index Task - 75\n  - Hadoop/Index Task - 50\n  - Merge/Append Task - 25\n  - Other Tasks - 0\n- Higher the number, higher the priority. \n\nFor example, if a Hadoop Index task is running and a Realtime Index task starts that wants to publish a segment for the same (or overlapping) interval for the same datasource, then it will override the task locks of the Hadoop Index task. Consequently, the Hadoop Index task will fail before publishing the segment.\n\nNote - There is no need to set this property, task automatically gets a default priority as per its type. However, if one wants to override the default priority it can be done by setting `lockPriority` inside `context` property like this -\n\n```\n  \"context\" {\n    \"lockPriority\" : \"80\"\n  }\n```\n\nMajor Implementation details -\n- Two new fields have been added to TaskLock namely priority and preemptive. \n- Modified and refactored tryLock method in TaskLockbox\n- Added upgradeLock method in TaskLockbox, MetaStorageActionHandler, SQLMetaStorageActionHandler, TaskStorage, MetadataTaskStorage and HeapMemoryTaskStorage\n- New Task Action named LockUpgradeAction has been added\n- Check for preemption of locks has been added in TaskActionToolbox which is performed before publishing the segments in SegmentInsertAction\n- Changed Task implementations to handle priority, preemption and check for lock validity\n- Modified ThreadPoolTaskRunner a bit to be helpful in testing lock override\n- Modified TaskSerdeTest to check for priority\n- Modified Task related docs\n- Added unit tests for TaskLock overriding in TaskLifeCylceTest\n- Added a task name TestIndexTask useful for unit testing\n\nPossible Future Enhancements - Proactively shutdown the tasks instead of waiting for them to fail eventually since their TaskLock has been revoked.\n\nEdit 08/05/2016 -\n\nPriority locking feature is configurable now, by default it is off and can be enabled by setting the runtime property `druid.indexer.taskLockboxVersion` to `v2`. \n- `TaskLockbox` in an interface and there are two implementations - `TaskLockboxV1` which is same as the previous `TaskLockbox` and`TaskLockboxV2` does priority based locking. One of them is injected at runtime in `CliOverlord` and `CliPeon` depending on `druid.indexer.taskLockboxVersion`\n- `TaskLockbox` has new method `boolean setTaskLockCriticalState(Task task, Interval interval, TaskLockCriticalState taskLockCriticalState)` meant for upgrading locks in case priority based locking is used. `TaskLockboxV1` always returns `true` for this method.\n- `TaskLock` has two new fields `priority` and `upgraded`. In case of `TaskLockboxV1` the corresponding values are always `0` and `true`. For `TaskLockboxV2` it is depended on the task. \n- Each task calls `setTaskLockCriticalState` before publishing segments. However, in case of `TaskLockboxV1` the method always returns `true` and extra overhead is just an HTTP call to overlord. In case of `TaskLockboxV2` it does the actual work of setting TaskLock state.\n- `Task` interface has `int getLockPriority()` method which I guess is OK\n","created_at":"2015-08-27T17:48:25Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T18:30:25Z","closed_at":"2018-11-14T18:30:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9356b7695f374964b2c6102eb47d9128de8eb950","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1679/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1679/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1679/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/78f826405fc0c0f301b6bcb76ade2ca48a7dcfef","head":{"label":"pjain1:priority_locking","ref":"priority_locking","sha":"78f826405fc0c0f301b6bcb76ade2ca48a7dcfef","user":{"login":"pjain1","id":11787983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzg3OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11787983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1","html_url":"https://github.com/pjain1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"decefb74777f6e1af89ec7375d5e9508fa6b6175","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":6358188,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzU4MTg4","name":"druid","full_name":"apache/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid","description":"Apache
