\"NIFI_HOME()\" function in Expression Language to obtain the installation directory of NIFI\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nUsually, I make a file '$NIFI_HOME/jdbc' to hold some jars of drivers. I find it's useful to provide a function to get the installation directory of NIFI, and we will use this such as `${NIFI_HOME():append('/jdbc/ojdbc8.jar')}` in `DbcpConnectionPoll` property. I think it will be useful for other scenes need to indicate file directory.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [√ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdd Kafka 2.5 Processors set (NIFI-7522), in order to : \r\n* Have the last fixes from Kafka\r\n* Use the static Membership Consumers (to reduce rebalancing)\r\n\r\nIt's a copy/paste from Kafka 2.0 processors, without new feature.\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\r\n- Kafka 2.5 use scala 2.12, and not 2.11 anymore.\r\n- Kafka 2.6 is late, maybe the next NIFI step could be Kafka 3.x. \r\n- To reduce the convenient store size, the idea is to put in profile the 0.9/0.10 processors (PR created by MikeThomsen : https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4364)\r\n- A 1st draft PR with some comments was there : https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4346 (closed because i PR from my master and not a dedicated branch).\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n**Infra :** \r\nThe static kafka membership has been tested with a kafka 2.5 single node, topic \"test\" with 5 partitions (Centos 8 Stream 20191219 with JDK8, Windows 10 with JDK8)\r\n\r\n**Code :** A NIFI template with 3 consumers is attached (NIFI template). [NIFI-7522 - Template-Test.zip](https://github.com/apache/nifi/files/4864666/NIFI-7522.-.Template-Test.zip)\r\n\r\nThe 3 consumers have a group.instance.id 01 02 03 and a session.timeout.ms of

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nRefactors the framework code to move Web/UI-related stuff into its own NAR, and to use ServiceLoader to find a NiFiServer implementation rather than hardcoding the JettyServer class as the required implementation (and thus a required NAR).\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

PR contains my proposal of Hazelcast support for DistributedMapCacheClient. In general, I followed the patterns I found in the existing implementations, for the cases were not explicitly documented the behaviour follows them, mainly the ones were added with the feature itself (I considered them the most relevant and accurate implementations)\r\n\r\nAs for the organisation of the implementation, I did split the feature into three \"layers\". The package structure follows this as well. In the bottom, there is the HazelcastCache, and the implementation. This layer is responsible to directly communicate with the Hazelcast (via a provided connection) and hide the details of the used data structure. The current implementation is based on IMap, but there is the possibility to change or extend this. Also, the map-like data structure's interface is heavily changed between Hazelcast 3.x and 4.x. In case if the support would be needed for older implementations, wrapping the logic could help to avoid sprawl of the changes.\r\n\r\nThe layer above is the \"cache manager\" (HazelcastCacheManager). This is responsible to create the cache instances and maintain the connection. Currently there are two implementation: one which starts an embedded Hazelcast for easy usage and one which connects to a Hazelcast cluster running outside NiFi. The embedded provides a limited capability for configuration, but it could serve effectively as local cache. The \"standalone\" could joint to any non-enterprise Hazelcast. Note: I looked after how to connect with secured Hazelcast, but as I found it is part of the enterprise package. For now, it was not part of my intent to support that. This layer should hide all Hazelcast specific interface or implementation.\r\n\r\nThe top layer is the actual DistributedMapCacheClient implementation. Depends on both the bottom ones, as the manager is needed for acquiring the cache which it works with. All the NiFi specific logic is within this. AtomicDistributedMapCacheClient methods are supported. The revision handling comes in with this is general for all the entries. A long-based version is attached to all the entries.\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on the proposal, I hope it would be useful for the community!\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n**Infra :** \r\nThe static kafka membership has been tested with a kafka 2.5 single node, topic \"test\" with 5 partitions (Centos 8 Stream 20191219 with JDK8)\r\n\r\n**Code :** A NIFI template with 3 consumers is attached (NIFI template). \r\n\r\nThe 3 consumers have a group.instance.id 01 02 03 and a session.timeout.ms of 10minutes. \r\n\r\n**Results :** \r\n* The consumer consumes (like in 2.0)\r\n* The  kafka server log show the join of the static consumer : \"Static member Some(01) of group CG with unknown member id rejoins\".","created_at":"2020-06-17T23:29:31Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T18:41:48Z","closed_at":"2020-07-01T18:41:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9deaacf1f8b7a646f173cf08c5c29baa46abc4f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/239a2e884c8a5c8215cf41c55122472e11dc419a","head":{"label":"gitfirenz:master","ref":"master","sha":"239a2e884c8a5c8215cf41c55122472e11dc419a","user":{"login":"gitfirenz","id":13589606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTg5NjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13589606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz","html_url":"https://github.com/gitfirenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitfirenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"239a2e884c8a5c8215cf41c55122472e11dc419a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27911088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzkxMTA4OA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"apache/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi","description":"Apache

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nIn NIFI-7501 it was established that people using GenerateFlowFile should sometimes be using DuplicateFlowFile as well to avoid IO bottlenecks blocking load testing. As such the description of GenerateFlowFile was updated. Furthermore, to be consistent with DuplicateFlowFile the load tag was added.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\nNIFI-7501\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-13T23:36:45Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T15:15:55Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T15:15:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"907e594ae5e22b782dc70b8b10c775ebd3a7bb09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/b843833f5331f93b77679e7cf8c508f5e7a3c78d","head":{"label":"dennisjaheruddin:generateflowfile_description","ref":"generateflowfile_description","sha":"b843833f5331f93b77679e7cf8c508f5e7a3c78d","user":{"login":"dennisjaheruddin","id":16139286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM5Mjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16139286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin","html_url":"https://github.com/dennisjaheruddin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":268506164,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjg1MDYxNjQ=","name":"nifi","full_name":"dennisjaheruddin/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dennisjaheruddin","id":16139286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM5Mjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16139286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin","html_url":"https://github.com/dennisjaheruddin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennisjaheruddin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dennisjaheruddin/nifi","description":"Apache

PR is an update of https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4329)\r\n\r\nNew commands were added to the CLI to be able to create/update users, user groups and access policies in NiFi Registry. As NiFi depends on released Registry, some code temporarily takes place in NiFi which should be moved to the Registry in the long term. Also, this comes with some code duplication as well (which will be removed in a later point too).\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nRather than propagate a SingularMatrixException all the way up the stack, instead just log it at debug level. Also I cleaned up some of the stream code and renamed the test class as it was misspelled so IDEs can't find it from the unit under test.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

commands were added to the CLI to be able to create/update users, user groups and access policies in NiFi Registry. As NiFi depends on released Registry, some code temporarily takes place in NiFi which should be moved to the Registry in the long term. Also, this comes with some code duplication as well (which will be removed in a later point too).\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This makes sense as they have a prerequisite, in the form of a parameter context. This change gives a more consistent experience for finding the functionality regarding parameters by ensuring the contextmenu shows the possibility to configure a parameter context. Once the paramater context has been created for a process group, the parameters text shows, so this is no longer visible. People would then need to click configure to change the context, just as they would be required to do now.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\nNIFI-7500\r\n- [x ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\nExecuted , there was a faillure in nifi-standard-processors but this should be independent of the change proposed. After continuing from nifi-framework-nar this part (which was actually changed) passed the tests succesfully, later other faillures occured in the unrelated nifi-email-processors\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\nBuild succesfull on JDK 8\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\nNo additional dependencies\r\n- [x ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\nNo impact on license\r\n- [ x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\nNo impact on notice\r\n- [x ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\nNo new properties\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n-
