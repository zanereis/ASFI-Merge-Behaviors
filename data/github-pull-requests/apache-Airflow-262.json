For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5004\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen building CI images you need to know whether you use v1-10-test or v1-10-stable branch (and use corresponding image).\r\n\r\nCurrently the default branch is read from _default_branch.sh . This is not a problem for master/v1-10-test distinction because those are in different \"physical\" branches, but v1-10-stable and v1-10-test are actually following one-another (v1-10-test moves first and when several commits pass, then stable branch follows).\r\n\r\nTherefore we need to utilise TRAVIS_BRANCH variable - this variable works in two modes - for PRs it is the branch that the PR is going to be merged to, whereas for triggered builds it's the branch from which the build was triggered. This is perfect for us to determine which image should be used during build.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAll tests!\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5001\r\n\r\nNOTE - this build depends on [AIRFLOW-4997] \"Support for non-master branches\" and [AIRFLOW-4999] \"The ci_local_build  and ci_local_pull_and_build pull only test image\" and only last commit is relevant. It should be merged after 4997 and 4999 are merged.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe docker build script is run in the main script which means you have around 1500 lines of output added to the logs at the beginning. This is useful but should be hidden by default. This can be solved by moving Docker building to \"before_install\" stage which will be automatically folded by Travis CI (still available but initially hidden in logs). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested automatically by running all tests. \r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4999\r\n\r\nNOTE - this build depends on [AIRFLOW-4997] Support for non-master branches and only last commit is relevant. It should be merged after 4997 is merged.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently the \"local_build\" scripts only work  on test image, but since we want to encourage people to run static checks locally, they should also build/pull&build the slim image.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested automatically by running all tests. \r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4997\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe need to build similar images for v1-10-stable and v1-10-tests and possibly for some future branches. We need to make sure that when v1-10-test PR/build is run in Travis, it uses relevant image (apache/airflow:v1-10-test-python...) and that when it is built on Dockerhub it pushes the right image.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested automatically by running all tests. \r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4013) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4013\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - The bug happens when schedule_interval is None. Marking one task for one day ends up marking all dates as Success or Failed.\r\n  - The fix is by looking up existing DagRun if schedule_interval is None, and only mark the ones falling between start_date and end_date as Success or Failed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Updated test_mark_tasks.py to test the cases where schedule_interval is None.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-20T03:09:13Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T14:53:37Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T14:53:28Z","merged_at":"2019-08-20T14:53:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"46885ccdbc8618f295b8f986da95c1abbb85bb02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b64c7db4ab07846484e6f712df9020a11094e842","head":{"label":"yuqian90:master","ref":"master","sha":"b64c7db4ab07846484e6f712df9020a11094e842","user":{"login":"yuqian90","id":6637585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6637585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqian90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3ee2dcb3fbebfd489b4e1c52eec5d767c4fa42d8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the docs state that local logs are preferred over remote logs. However, looking at the remote logging handlers for AWS S3, Azure Blog Storage, and Google Cloud Storage, each of them actually gives precedence to the remote logs. This corrects the documentation.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, it looks like the ElasticSearch remote storage handler has no fallback to local logs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4883\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDag processing processes are now timed out externally which is more robust using the DAG parsing timeout.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated existing tests. Also tested locally with a DAG that timed out and made sure the process got restarted and the logline appeared. It's a bit hard to make a good unit test for this since sleeping is a a testing smell, and I don't think there is a trivial way to mock this in the Airflow tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4074\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-733 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-883\r\n- Closes #7976\r\n- Closes #7996 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] To make this work we set an attribute on the wrapped __init__ method so that we can \"re-invoke\" it later with the same arguments, but with defaults applied.\r\n\r\n  `__init__` is a \"normal\" method in Python, it doesn't handle the allocation so recalling it is safe. (`new X()` is roughly the same as `X.__new__().__init__()`)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Added new tests/models/test_baseoperator.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`","created_at":"2019-07-16T10:46:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T09:12:09Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T18:48:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f95a853aae0979f8876db1c84e40a39bc1c08a6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following issues:\r\n  - [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/AIRFLOW-4924): AIRFLOW-4924\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* Scalability Issue in Webserver\r\nAirflow webserver uses gunicorn workers to serve HTTP requests. It loads all DAGs from DAG files before serving requests. If there are many DAGs (e.g., > 1,000), loading all DAGs can take a significant amount of time.\r\nAirflow webserver also relies on restarting gunicorn workers to refresh all DAGs. This refreshing interval is set by webserver-worker_refresh_interval, default to 30s. As a result, if loading all DAGs takes >30s, the webserver will never be ready for HTTP requests.\r\nThe current solution is to skip loading DAGs by using env var SKIP_DAGS_PARSING. It makes the webserver work, but there is no DAG on the UI.\r\n\r\n* Asynchronously DAG Loading\r\nThe solution here is to load DAGs asynchronously in the background. It creates a background process to load DAGs, stringifies DAGs, and sends DAGs to gunicorn worker process. The stringifying step is needed because some fields can not be pickled, e.g., locally defined functions and user defined modules. It aggressively transform all fields of DAG and task to be string-compatible.\r\nThis feature is enabled by webserver-async_dagbag_loader=True. The background process sends DAGs to gunicorn worker gradually (every webserver-dagbag_sync_interval). DAG refreshing interval is controlled by webserver-collect_dags_interval.\r\nAsynchronous DAG loading has been released in Google Cloud Composer as an Alpha feature:\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/release-notes\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/accessing/airflow-web-interface\r\n\r\nThis issue is created to merge the feature to Airflow upstream.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - tests/dags/test_stringified_dags.py\r\n   - DAGs can be successfully stringified, pickled and sent over multiprocess queue.\r\n - tests/www/test_async_dag_loaders.py\r\n   - asynchronous DAG loader can successfully load DAGs.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n- [✅] My PR addresses the following: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4961\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [✅] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI raised https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4961 earlier today, to cover a minor issue we encountered whilst running airflow using CockroachDB. That ticket covers the full explanation of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ 🤔] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThere aren't currently unit tests for testfail.py (that's not to say there shouldn't be), and an integration test would pass with the present code anyway, as Postgres' error handling masks the issue.  \r\nIt's also a pretty trivial change. Happy to add a test for testfail.py if we feel it's needed though.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ✅] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ✅] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ✅ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-15T16:19:25Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T23:51:26Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T11:22:40Z","merged_at":"2019-07-30T11:22:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d02a9db0035e253b7438219ab3e669f79e6b2cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/dd2f27aa8a7f6028f8062e29b3905ea693857663","head":{"label":"fahran:bugfix/AIRFLOW-4961-task-failure-sql-error","ref":"bugfix/AIRFLOW-4961-task-failure-sql-error","sha":"dd2f27aa8a7f6028f8062e29b3905ea693857663","user":{"login":"fahran","id":2371903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzE5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2371903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran","html_url":"https://github.com/fahran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197021567,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcwMjE1Njc=","name":"airflow","full_name":"fahran/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fahran","id":2371903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzE5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2371903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran","html_url":"https://github.com/fahran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fahran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fahran/airflow","description":"Apache

be unit tested.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-4959\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4959\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-4959\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4956\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf there's an exception in LocalTaskJob, e.g. DB connectivity error, the job will not wait before attempting the next heartbeat, causing the job to spam retry attempts and task logging.\r\n\r\nThis PR will unify the usage of `BaseJob.heartbeat()` so that exceptions are handled all inside the method instead of caller.\r\n\r\nThis PR also replaces `local_task_job_heartbeat_fail` metric with `lower(JobClassName)_heartbeat_failure` metrics so all jobs can have StatsD metrics on heartbeat failures.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`tests/jobs/test_local_task_job.py. test_heartbeat_failed_fast`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4941\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWarning the user that `default_args` and `params` from the `DAG` won't be applied to the operator if \r\nthe `DAG` is specified through setter instead of `__init__`.\r\n\r\nWhy not apply the `default_args` in the setter then?\r\nA few reasons:\r\n- It will unnecessary complicates the `BaseOperator` logic and I think `DAG` should only be specified through `__init__` instead of setter. I think ultimately we probably should deprecate the setter to prefer `__init__`\r\n- If user specified a arg with value equal to the default arg value in the `__init__` signature, we won't be able to tell from the setter whether we should override the value with the `default_args`. Please find the example below:\r\n```\r\ndag = DAG('dag', default_args={'email_on_failure': False})\r\n\r\nop = BaseOperator(\r\n    task_id='op',\r\n    email_on_failure=True,  # happen to be the same as the default value in __init__ signature\r\n)\r\n\r\nop.dag = dag\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nJust a warning message.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-12T23:17:01Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T17:42:10Z","closed_at":"2019-07-15T17:42:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8241743340dd7a7ac9d6407bb4a0c07f87c31980","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/65d0ce287c2b5173d6641a7e7ee91f75e5e6b3c2","head":{"label":"milton0825:warn-if-dag-setter-used","ref":"warn-if-dag-setter-used","sha":"65d0ce287c2b5173d6641a7e7ee91f75e5e6b3c2","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171764273,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE3NjQyNzM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"milton0825/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4934\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Werkzeug 0.15, `enable_proxy_fix` doesn't work as expected as per this [Github issue](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/issues/1484).\r\n\r\nWe should fix it to at least respect what was previous behavior. We can eventually also offer a configuration to customize the new behavior, however this is breaking old behavior, and is (I believe) required within the next/current Airflow release due to Flask pinning the Werkzeug version.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nConsumption of Werkzeug client (similar to #3983)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4930\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4930\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Druid hook sends json string using `json=` argument of requests library, which makes it impossible to be parsed by Druid coordinator\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- I added the case `test_submit_correct_json_body` at druid_hook test. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4928\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nEvery `airflow.configuration.conf` method is being called multiple times. We can avoid redundant evaluation by storing the parsed value in the class namespace.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIs already covered. No new features are implemented.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-10T22:41:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T08:46:18Z","closed_at":"2019-09-19T08:46:18Z","merged_at":"2019-09-19T08:46:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"23ec78a42403ce9df062cee6371cd28cc0834206","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d70acb4fc9ae160ffa06662b278274197200f66b","head":{"label":"serkef:AIRFLOW-4928_Remove_redundant_config_parse","ref":"AIRFLOW-4928_Remove_redundant_config_parse","sha":"d70acb4fc9ae160ffa06662b278274197200f66b","user":{"login":"serkef","id":3225779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjU3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3225779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef","html_url":"https://github.com/serkef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187592875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc1OTI4NzU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"serkef/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"serkef","id":3225779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjU3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3225779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef","html_url":"https://github.com/serkef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/serkef/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4926\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nExample dags with datetime.utcnow() start_date do not run tasks.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to change the start_date to a date where a period (execution_date + schedule_interval) can end.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-10T11:02:12Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T09:38:56Z","closed_at":"2019-07-11T06:13:28Z","merged_at":"2019-07-11T06:13:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"5aaeb721ce67c661f3599062ac57623afcb9a4cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0c0dd3b16f3084b1329afc827f7c073b751e171c","head":{"label":"feluelle:feature/AIRFLOW-4926-fix-datetime-now-start-dates","ref":"feature/AIRFLOW-4926-fix-datetime-now-start-dates","sha":"0c0dd3b16f3084b1329afc827f7c073b751e171c","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122377019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIzNzcwMTk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feluelle/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle/airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-10T09:11:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T09:41:54Z","closed_at":"2019-07-11T10:27:47Z","merged_at":"2019-07-11T10:27:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"b49cbdd237a77c3d12a8a1f6098e42a38bd173db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5552/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5552/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5552/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/33ebfa5bea5dbcede05812418dc7de226df347de","head":{"label":"feluelle:improvement/AIRFLOW-4925-variables-import-file","ref":"improvement/AIRFLOW-4925-variables-import-file","sha":"33ebfa5bea5dbcede05812418dc7de226df347de","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122377019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIzNzcwMTk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feluelle/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4905\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFlake8 output is coloured. Note that this should only be merged after #4938  is merged - as we need to have flake8-colours dependency added and we need to have a common way of running flake (via Dockerfile (otherwise the output is pretty unreadable)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo tests needed.\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-07T18:43:39Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T13:06:44Z","closed_at":"2019-07-11T13:06:44Z","merged_at":"2019-07-11T13:06:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f41eb75ad33a7edfeb2414d905e9b51fff3732a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e1ca475fe1e0d8f4fa9f675bdeb460b64fb07c9b","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:coloured-flake8-output","ref":"coloured-flake8-output","sha":"e1ca475fe1e0d8f4fa9f675bdeb460b64fb07c9b","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`KubernetesExecutorConfig`'s `labels` argument currently defaults to `{}` which is a mutable value. Mutable default arguments are undesirable in python since default arguments are evaluated at function definition time instead of at call time.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCovered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd Huq Industries to company list in readme \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Add one line of text into the readme.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4892\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The form validation for classic UI was failing with an error on the\r\n(most often hidden) Num Retries field.\r\n\r\n  RBAC was failing because the form wasn't rendering due to a typo in a\r\ncherry-pick/backport to www_rbac.\r\n\r\n  Both of these apply to the release branch only as they were the result of me back-porting PRs from master that had in-sufficient test. I have a separate PR to add more tests to the connection form on master.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Added some tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-03T17:48:28Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T18:11:26Z","closed_at":"2019-07-04T10:52:45Z","merged_at":"2019-07-04T10:52:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"5eba82c4baa1dfe739d49ec7c2a56f02a8bb9f40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0326528da3669a3b79417f89421b12c4ada79659","head":{"label":"ashb:connection_form_extra_validator","ref":"connection_form_extra_validator","sha":"0326528da3669a3b79417f89421b12c4ada79659","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache
