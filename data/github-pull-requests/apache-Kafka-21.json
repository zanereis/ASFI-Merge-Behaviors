The change mainly includes\r\n- adding `ConsumerProtocolConsumerEventHandler` for the consumers using the new protocol.\r\n- some other fixes to consumer_test.py with the new framework which fixes\r\n  - [KAFKA-16576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16576): fixed by getting `partition_owner` after the group is fully stabilized.\r\n  - [KAFKA-17219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17219): The first issue is the same as KAFKA-16576.

change implements the KRaft voter sending UpdateVoter request. The UpdateVoter RPC is used to update a voter's listeners and supported kraft versions. The UpdateVoter RPC is sent if the replicated voter set (VotersRecord in the log) doesn't match the local voter's supported kraft versions and controller listeners.\r\n\r\nTo not starve the Fetch request, the UpdateVoter request is sent at most every 3 fetch timeouts. This is required to make sure that replication is making progress and eventually the voter set in the replicated log matches the local voter configuration.\r\n\r\nThis change also modifies the semantic for UpdateVoter. Now the UpdateVoter response is sent right after the leader has created the new voter set. This is required so that updating voter can transition from sending UpdateVoter request to sending Fetch request. If the leader waits for the VotersRecord control record to commit before sending the UpdateVoter response, it may never send the UpdateVoter response. This can happen if the leader needs that voter's Fetch request to commit the control record.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

[KAFKA-17294](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17294)\r\n\r\nThe original behavior was implemented to maintain the behavior of the Classic consumer, where the `ConsumerCoordinator` would do the same when handling the `OffsetFetchResponse`. This behavior is being updated for the legacy coordinator as part of [KAFKA-17279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17279), to retry on all retriable errors.\r\n\r\nWe should review and update the `CommitRequestManager` to align with this, and retry on all retriable errors, which seems sensible when fetching offsets.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding PR for classic consumer is #16826 \r\n###

[KAFKA-17270](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17270)\r\n\r\n`Exit.scala` is a wrapper around `Exit.java`, and its main benefit is that it allows methods to throw exceptions by returning `Nothing`. This benefit is minimal, and since we are planning to phase out Scala code, it would be better to use `Exit.java` directly and remove `Exit.scala`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

by #17324 \r\nThis PR adds ability to specify a custom produce request parser. A custom produce request parser would allow to intercept all incoming messages before they get into the broker and apply broker wide logic to the messages. This could be a trace , a filter, or a transform(such as lineage).\r\nThe inline new ProduceRequest(new ProduceRequestData(new ByteBufferAccessor(buffer), version), version) was moved out of [ProduceRequest.java](https://app.slack.com/client/EAZPKTY6A/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/ProduceRequest.java) into its own class [ProduceRequestParser.java](https://app.slack.com/client/EAZPKTY6A/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/ProduceRequestParser.java), and ProduceRequest class was augmented with the dynamic loading of a specified parser class.

PR adds ability to specify a custom produce request parser. A custom produce request parser would allow to intercept all incoming messages before they get into the broker and apply broker wide logic to the messages. This could be a trace , a filter, or a transform(such as lineage). \r\n\r\nThe inline `new ProduceRequest(new ProduceRequestData(new ByteBufferAccessor(buffer), version), version)` was moved out of [ProduceRequest.java](clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/ProduceRequest.java) into its own class [ProduceRequestParser.java](clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/ProduceRequestParser.java), and ProduceRequest class was augmented with the dynamic loading of a specified parser class. When no class is specified, the default one is loaded maintaining full backward compatibilty.  \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17235\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is a change we introduced in [KAFKA-16879](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16879), where we modified the PushHttpMetricsReporter constructor to use Time.System [1]. However, Time.System doesn't exist in Kafka versions 0.8.2 and 0.9.\r\n\r\nIn test_performance_services.py, we have system tests for Kafka versions 0.8.2 and 0.9 [2]. These tests always use the tools JAR from the trunk branch, regardless of the Kafka version being tested [3], while the client JAR aligns with the Kafka version specified in the test suite [4]. This discrepancy is what causes the issue to arise.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, we have a few options:\r\n- Add Time.System to Kafka 0.8.2 and 0.9: This isn't practical, as we no longer maintain these versions.\r\n~~- Modify the PushHttpMetricsReporter constructor to use new SystemTime() instead of Time.System: This would contradict the intent of [KAFKA-16879](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16879), which aims to make SystemTime a singleton.~~\r\n- Implement Time in PushHttpMetricsReporter use the time to get current time\r\n- Remove system tests for Kafka 0.8.2 and 0.9 from test_performance_services.py\r\n\r\n~~Given that we no longer maintain Kafka 0.8.2 and 0.9, and altering the constructor goes against the design goals of [KAFKA-16879](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16879), option 3 appears to be the most feasible solution. However, I'm not sure whether it's acceptable to remove these old version tests. Maybe someone else has a better solution~~\r\n\r\n\"We'll proceed with option 2 since support for versions 0.8 and 0.9 is still required, meaning we can't remove those Kafka versions from the system tests.\"\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/133f2b0f311ba1fd5a999f477bad38370c1772ca/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/tools/PushHttpMetricsReporter.java#L99\r\n[2]

the current session key tracking logic on trunk, there's a small chance that a herder may not updated its [sessionKey field](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8438c4339e0a103d95575336a9f3653698cd0b8e/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L219) to contain a session key, even if a key is present in the topic and has been read by the `KafkaConfigBackingStore`'s work thread.\r\n\r\nThis is because the backing store does not notify its listener of new records consumed from the config topic while it is starting up, which for most record types (connector configs, target states, restart requests, etc.) is perfectly valid. However, for session keys, it's fine to notify the herder, since the only thing that it does is [update a few fields](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8438c4339e0a103d95575336a9f3653698cd0b8e/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L2508-L2522).\r\n\r\nThis should hopefully address some flaky test failures we've seen for the `DedicatedMirrorIntegrationTest::testMultiNodeCluster` case, like the one [here](https://ge.apache.org/starting/s/52il7msnknzp2/tests/task/:connect:mirror:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.integration.DedicatedMirrorIntegrationTest/testMultiNodeCluster()?top-execution=1).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-03T17:06:22Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T03:35:46Z","closed_at":"2025-02-06T03:35:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

been seeing some flaky failures lately for the `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTransactionsTest` with this stack trace:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Timeout expired after 60000ms while awaiting InitProducerId\r\n```\r\n\r\n(We don't get any other stack frames because the Kafka `TimeoutException` class [doesn't provide them](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5afdb17092f99d956bf65fcb543de0b15c04e01f/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/errors/ApiException.java#L45-L49)).\r\n\r\nOne example of this failure can be found [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/52il7msnknzp2/tests/task/:connect:mirror:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.integration.MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTransactionsTest/testReplicationWithoutOffsetSyncWillNotCreateOffsetSyncsTopic()?top-execution=1).\r\n\r\nAfter examining the logs for one of these failures, it looks like this is either due to a broker bug, or slow CI. During a successful run of the test, it took 23 seconds for `Producer::initTransactions` to complete. It's not inconceivable that when CI load is high, it may take higher than a minute for that same method to complete, which would explain the failures we've been seeing.\r\n\r\nIn order to be resilient against slow CI, or at least rule that out as a root cause, we can bump the producer's `max.block.ms` from its default of 1 minute to a higher timeout of 5 minutes, which should give it plenty of time to complete `initTransactions`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

a small chance for a race condition that can record an incorrect stage for callbacks in `DistributedHerder::addRequest`.\r\n\r\nThe order of operations on trunk is:\r\n1. Add the request to the queue\r\n2. If necessary, wake up the tick thread from polling the group coordinator\r\n3. Record the current tick thread stage on the request callback\r\n\r\nThis is valid in most cases, but when a separate thread takes \"ownership\" of the request callback and begins recording stages on it, then the stage that's recorded in step 3 above may incorrectly overwrite stages reported on that separate thread if the request has already started running at that point.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with submitting new connector configs to the config topic where we first validate the connector config on a separate thread.\r\n\r\nThis may explain some of the flaky failures we've seen for the `BlockingConnectorTest`, like the recent one [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/omkkps6tf2e2w/tests/task/:connect:runtime:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.BlockingConnectorTest/testBlockInConnectorConfig()?top-execution=1) on trunk.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-02T19:04:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-05T18:36:42Z","closed_at":"2024-08-05T18:36:39Z","merged_at":"2024-08-05T18:36:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f3e3767976159d1291d81699d53618c3cc224eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d9e2454924961376afeb9ff1f4f63a415a7e8d02","head":{"label":"apache:fix-distributed-herder-stage-recording-in-add-request","ref":"fix-distributed-herder-stage-recording-in-add-request","sha":"d9e2454924961376afeb9ff1f4f63a415a7e8d02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

to close KAFKA-17316\r\n\r\nThe goal of this change is to refactor the existing code so that new Implementations of the StandardAuthorizer may be created by creating new implementations of  StandardAuthorizerData class.\r\n\r\nChanges include\r\n\r\n- creation of an AbstractAuthorizerData class for consistent logging implementation.\r\n- Moving MatchingRule interface and implementations from StandardAuthorizerData.java to AuthorizerData.java\r\n- Adding a  authorizeByResourceType method to AuthorizerData.\r\n- Implementing authorizeByResourceType in StandardAuthorizerData by reimplementing the default Authorizer.authorizeByResourceType method.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis is a precursor to the Trie implementation described in KIP-1042.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

PR adds support for add-controller and remove-controller in the kafka-metadata-quorum.sh command-line tool. It also fixes some minor server-side bugs that blocked the tool from working.\r\n\r\nIn kafka-metadata-quorum.sh, the implementation of remove-controller is fairly straightforward. It just takes some command-line flags and uses them to invoke AdminClient. The add-controller implementation is a bit more complex because we have to look at the new controller's configuration file. The parsing logic for the `advertised.listeners` and `listeners` server configurations that we need was previously implemented in the :core module. However, the gradle module where kafka-metadata-quorum.sh lives, :tools, cannot depend on :core. Therefore, I moved listener parsing into `SocketServerConfigs.listenerListToEndPoints`. This will be a small step forward in our efforts to move Kafka configuration out of :core.\r\n\r\nI also made some minor changes in kafka-metadata-quorum.sh and Kafka-storage-tool.sh to handle --help without displaying a backtrace on the screen, and give slightly better error messages on stderr. Also, in DynamicVoter.toString, we now enclose the host in brackets if it contains a colon (as IPV6 addresses can).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes our handling of clusterId in `addRaftVoter` and `removeRaftVoter`, in two ways. Firstly, it marks `clusterId` as nullable in the `AddRaftVoterRequest.json` and `RemoveRaftVoterRequest.json` schemas, as it was always intended to be. Secondly, it allows AdminClient to optionally send clusterId, by using `AddRaftVoterOptions` and `RemoveRaftVoterOptions`. We now also remember to properly set `timeoutMs` in `AddRaftVoterRequest`. This PR adds unit tests for `KafkaAdminClient#addRaftVoter` and `KafkaAdminClient#removeRaftVoter`, to make sure they are sending the right things.\r\n\r\nFinally, I fixed some minor server-side bugs that were blocking the handling of these RPCs. Firstly, `ApiKeys.ADD_RAFT_VOTER` and `ApiKeys.REMOVE_RAFT_VOTER` are now marked as forwardable so that forwarding from the broker to the active controller works correctly. Secondly, `org.apache.kafka.raft.KafkaNetworkChannel` has now been updated to enable `API_VERSIONS_REQUEST` and `API_VERSIONS_RESPONSE`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Murali Basani

have some retry logic to wait for the deletion of the config topic to completely take effect when asserting that some requests time out after the topic has been deleted, but the first request we issue is to delete a connector, which is not idempotent. This can lead to test failures when an attempt to delete the connector succeeds once, then fails afterwards with a 404 error (because the connector no longer exists).\r\n\r\nThese failures occurred on a pull request [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/n2fmmm2p5isa6/tests/task/:connect:runtime:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ConnectWorkerIntegrationTest/testRequestTimeouts()?top-execution=1) and on trunk [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/jtlvyxuigzg3w/tests/task/:connect:runtime:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ConnectWorkerIntegrationTest/testRequestTimeouts()?top-execution=1) and [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/52il7msnknzp2/tests/task/:connect:runtime:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ConnectWorkerIntegrationTest/testRequestTimeouts()?top-execution=1).\r\n\r\nAs a fix, we can reverse the order of operations, so that we first verify that an attempt to reconfigure the connector has timed out, then assert that an attempt to delete the connector times out (with the same error message as the first operation).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

been seeing some flaky test failures since we modified the consumer group warmup logic with the exception `java.lang.IllegalStateException: You can only check the position for partitions assigned to this consumer.`\r\n\r\nThese are caused because, even after `Consumer::poll` has returned, it's possible that the consumer has not yet joined the group or been assigned topic partitions.\r\n\r\nThese failures occurred on a pull request [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/uxzbygqa2cifm/tests/task/:connect:mirror:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.integration.MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest/testReplicationWithEmptyPartition()?top-execution=1), and on trunk [here](https://ge.apache.org/s/5lsuaeqmmjrq2/tests/task/:connect:mirror:test/details/org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.integration.MirrorConnectorsIntegrationSSLTest/testNoCheckpointsIfNoRecordsAreMirrored()?top-execution=1).\r\n\r\nTo address this, some retry logic is added during consumer warmup to ensure (for real this time!) that the consumer has joined the group and fetched offsets for every applicable topic partition before committing offsets.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-01T19:50:35Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T17:57:08Z","closed_at":"2024-08-02T17:57:05Z","merged_at":"2024-08-02T17:57:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"5afdb17092f99d956bf65fcb543de0b15c04e01f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

examining log files, it looks like this is a genuine case of timeouts being too low; in the three failures I examined, the sink connector's consumer group was never able to form or handle offset commits because the separate Kafka cluster it targeted didn't have a group coordinator and was still creating the internal offsets topic.\r\n\r\nInstead of just increasing timeouts, I'd like to add an enhanced cluster readiness check for our `EmbeddedKafkaCluster` class that's automatically performed on startup. This way, not only do we give the test cases above more time to run (assuming that a significant amount of their runtime is currently taken up by bringing up the separate Kafka cluster), we also have better insight into whether future failures are caused by broker startup issues or something else.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

I checked the old versions and do not find this metric was ever working hence we might consider of removing this metric if it's not worth.</b>*\r\n\r\nKafka Consumer client registers node/connection latency metrics in [Selector.java](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/9d634629f29cd402a723d7e7bece18c8099065a4/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/network/Selector.java#L1359) but the values against the metric is never recorded. This seems to be an issue since inception. However, the same metric is also created for Kafka Producer but the value is recorded for Kafka Producer in [Sender.java](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/9d634629f29cd402a723d7e7bece18c8099065a4/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/Sender.java#L1092). Hence node - request-latency-max and request-latency-avg appears correctly for Kafka Producer but is NaN for Kafka Consumer.\r\n\r\nThough it's not clear which request latency this metric should hold i.e. all requests originating for consumer or any specific. The PR adds `fetch latency` as `node` `request-latency`. As the Kafka Producer also has several outgoing requests from client but records `produce latency` as  `node` `request-latency` hence similar concept is applied for consumer, which captures `fetch latency` as `node` `request-latency`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know the feedback and what best this metric should hold.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

commit implements the changes for [KIP-1032](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1032%3A+Upgrade+to+Jakarta+and+JavaEE+10+in+Kafka+4.0). This updates Kafka to Jakarta specs, JavaEE 10 and Jetty 12. The changes here primarily effect Kafka Connect and MM2.\r\n\r\n**Todo/Notes:**\r\n\r\n1. I bumped the connect modules to JDK 17 but I also had to bump a couple other things that had a dependency on conect. The tools project depends on connect so that had to be bumped, and streams depends on tools so that needed to be bumped. This means we may need to separate some things if we don't want to enforce JDK 17 on streams.\r\n2. There is an issue with a test in DedicatedMirrorIntegrationTest that I had to change for now that involves escaping characters and not quite sure what to do about it yet. The cause is the Servlet 6 spec changing what is allowed in the path. See: https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/11890\r\n3. I had to configure the idle timeout in Jetty requests to match our request timeout so tests didn't fail. This was needed to fix the `ConnectWorkerIntegrationTest#testPollTimeoutExpiry()` test\r\n\r\nTesting is being done by just using the existing tests for Connect and MM2 which should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-31T16:31:54Z","updated_at":"2024-12-13T22:44:41Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T15:24:14Z","merged_at":"2024-12-11T15:24:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd6d0fbf3d6a2eee4703a4cfcaaa3d6c775c5681","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851034845,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzQ4NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tools","name":"tools","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4511886370,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABDO3sIg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/mirror-maker-2","name":"mirror-maker-2","color":"1282B2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5533745141,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSdY_9Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/dependencies","name":"dependencies","color":"0366d6","default":false,"description":"Pull
