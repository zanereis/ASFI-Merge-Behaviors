Description ##\r\nThis PR provides consistent behaviour for the arange operator between ARM and x86 devices.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nFixes edge cases when running arange on ARM.  These cases were failing the test_arange test.  The problem was routed in the fact that converting from floats to unsigned in C++ happens differently on different platforms.  ARM for example initializes the resulting unsigned data structure to 0, whereas x86 initializes it to the two's complement representation of the negative value.  Numpy uses the two's complement form both on x86 and ARM.  To maintain compatibility with Numpy, and consistency across devices I've changed our implementation to first cast to signed, then unsigned types.  This forces 2's complement form on both architectures.\r\n\r\nTracked this one down together with @larroy.

(`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Rename `.classifier` to `.output`\r\n- [x] Move extra layers that were in `.classifier` to `.features`.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change is to make the division of `features` and `output` consistent across different networks. `classifier` is renamed to `output` because the network doesn't necessarily perform classification.\r\n- I've tested locally that the pre-trained weights can still be loaded for all models after the change.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-27T06:50:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T23:49:15Z","closed_at":"2017-10-27T23:39:10Z","merged_at":"2017-10-27T23:39:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ebf682b0b79260a976b57e123c82c649b785b6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3f4eb00dafe521125d95392bcca1574aeaa77880","head":{"label":"szha:zoo_rename","ref":"zoo_rename","sha":"3f4eb00dafe521125d95392bcca1574aeaa77880","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92538952,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjUzODk1Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"szha/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szha/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdd a HybridBlock type Lambda that supports using any op or function as stateless block.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add lambda block, and tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Currently it is possible for user to plugin a function that can only work on ndarray, even though this Lambda is a HybridBlock. Its intended for mixed use with regular

rtc was run on a Tesla or Pascal device previously the user would receive an 'imports not found' error.  This was due to the fact that we were using compute capability 3 by default, which was causing modern devices to fail to load a correct library.  We now will read from the first cuda capable device on the system  and use it's compute capability instead of the default.  If the user does specify a gpu architecture explicitly when calling rtc then we use the explicit value.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nAddresses:   #8387 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

kvstore, make it can support fp16.\r\n 1. Use copyfromto() to convert fp32 to fp16 before pass the key-value to PSLite.\r\n 2.  In kvstore server, conver fp16 to fp32 and compute in cpu. If we want to compute in fp16, we must pass them to GPU first. Because it's very slow for cpu to compute fp16.\r\n 3. We test several networks in 2 distributed machines. In test, weights and gradients were all in fp16. The speed result is shown below. 'fp16-server-16gpu' means kvstore server compute in fp16 format on gpu.

Description ##\r\nThis PR contains changes to asscipy to convert from CSRNDArray to scipy csr_matrix. \r\nThis also contains support for COO format for the csr_matrix construction. Performance wise it is 20X slower on construction when compared to CSR format, which is expected because of multiple scipy calls to create a scipy coo matrix, convert it to a scipy csr matrix and then convert it back to CSRNDArray.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] asscipy, tests\r\n- [x] coo format, tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\n- Completes two TODOs in #8168

Description ##\r\n- As #8116 removes [wait_to_write](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8116/files#diff-0cd6fcb2cd941d4c4a829bb3d7ea3d63L274) when updating comm_buff, it's not safe to pass NDArray* to the callback for row_sparse_pull. Now changed to NDArray. \r\n- Removed the usage of `mshadow::range` in `FillDnsZerosRspImpl` since `mshadow::range` uses float to calculate the tensor shape and is inaccurate for large shapes. \r\n- Added unit test for pulling empty sparse weights\r\n- Removed wrong/misleading comments\r\n\r\n@bhavinthaker @madjam @rahul003 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style

Only these elements are encoded and sent. The elements of the gradient that are near zero can safely be delayed by aggregating them in a residual array. When the updated residual with gradient of next iterations exceed the threshold, these values are sent. Effectively these values are updated at a lower frequency. \r\nOn the receiver's end we decompress the data and use the decompressed weights.\r\nSpecifically in this PR, 2bit quantization has been implemented.\r\n\r\n### Two bit quantization\r\nUses two thresholds to quantize the data, one positive threshold and one negative threshold. Any positive value greater than or equal to the positive threshold is set to one value (say 01), any negative value lower than or equal to the negative threshold is set to second value (say 10), and others are set to third value (say 0). We need three values to represent data in this fashion and hence two bits. We understand this leads to one bit going waste, but that's an optimization to be done later. The error in quantization is accumulated as residual and carried over to the next iterations. This is added in the next iteration to the gradient before quantizing. \r\nAn example below with thresholds of -2.0 and 2.0\r\n![Quantization at work](https://i.imgur.com/AtBVg92.png)\r\n\r\n### Format of compressed gradient\r\nThe first two elements are the thresholds used for quantization. The third element is the size of the original array. These values are required to dequantize the gradient. Any element from the 4th element, represents compressed gradient. Each value from the 4th element, represents upto 16 elements in the original array. For the example above, we get\r\n```compr = [ -2.0, 2.0, 8, 6.1215606E-28]```\r\nNote that the binary representation of the last element is \r\n```00 01 00 10 01 00 00 10  0000000000000000```\r\n\r\n### Local kvstore\r\nWhen using local kvstore, gradients compression only happens when using device communication. When gradients are pushed, before summing them up (Reduce), quantization and dequantization happen.\r\nExample: Say we have 4 GPUs, and the gradients are being summed up on GPU0. Each device quantizes gradients, then sends quantized gradient to GPU0, which performs dequantization of this data before merging it with values from other GPUs. Note that here, there is no need to quantize gradients from GPU0 itself, but it is still being done so that there is no bias for the samples which were processed by GPU0. **Please let me know if this is not a good idea.**\r\n\r\n### Dist kvstore\r\nWhen the set_compress method for kvstore is called, each worker sets those compress params and one worker sends these params to all servers. From then on, when before each value is pushed to the server, it is quantized. The server dequantizes the data and stores it as an array of the original size. When values are pulled from the server, it returns an array of the original size. The same happens when each server is handling shards of the data.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe reason I used a dictionary compress_params for the arguments was to ensure uniformity when we extend this to other quantization techniques. This is because each technique would take different type and number of parameters.\r\n#### Operators \r\n```\r\ncompr = mx.nd.contrib.create_2bit(grad)\r\nmx.nd.contrib.quantize_2bit(grad, residual, compr, neg_threshold, pos_threshold)\r\nmx.nd.contrib.dequantize_2bit(compr, decompr)\r\n```\r\n#### KVstore\r\n```\r\nkv = mx.kv.create('dist_sync')\r\nkv.set_compress({'compress':'2bit', 'pos_threshold':0.5, 'neg_threshold':-0.5})\r\n```\r\n#### Module\r\n```\r\nmod = mx.mod.Module(net, compress_params={'compress':'2bit', 'pos_threshold':0.5, 'neg_threshold':-0.5})\r\n ```\r\n#### Gluon Trainer\r\n```\r\ntrainer = gluon.Trainer(net.collect_params(), 'sgd', {'learning_rate': .1}, \r\n                        compress_params={'compress':'2bit', 'pos_threshold':0.5, 'neg_threshold':-0.5})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n1. [Refer kvstore local section above] Should I not do quantization and dequantization for the gradient on the GPU which is performing reduction?\r\n\r\n2. On running nvprof for the GPU operator with large arrays, most time is taken by the MapPlanKernel and cudaStreamSynchronize like below. For small arrays, the quantize, dequantize operations are on top. Any suggestions to reduce the time taken by these operations in the operator?\r\n```\r\nTime(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name\r\n 48.17%  11.9536s     50002  239.06us  223.23us  357.70us  void mshadow::cuda::MapPlanKernel<mshadow::sv::saveto, int=8, mshadow::expr::Plan<mshadow::Tensor<mshadow::gpu, int=1, float>, float>, mshadow::expr::Plan<mshadow::expr::ScalarExp<float>, float>>(mshadow::gpu, unsigned int, mshadow::Shape<int=2>, int=1)\r\n...\r\n\r\n==24796== API calls:\r\nTime(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name\r\n 63.81%  26.3938s    200002  131.97us  4.2860us  6.0096ms  cudaStreamSynchronize\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Only worker to server communication is compressed. Server to worker communication (during pull) involves sending original sized arrays. I read a couple of papers based on gradient compression. They only exchange gradients, and not the full weights. In MXNet with dist kvstore workers pushes updates to the gradient, but server maintains weights in full and returns full weights. This limits how much communication we can reduce. The full weights are much less sparse than gradients. If the full model weights are compressed, I believe it would lead to much worse accuracy. What do you

Description ##\r\nIn python 3 `pickle.dumps` returns a `bytes` object (instead of the `str` object in python 2). The `c_str` function however expects a string (on which it will call `.encode`. The fix is to detect if the return value of `pickle.dumps` is not a `str`. This is only true in python 3. If so we manually convert the `bytes` object to `str`.\r\n\r\nThis is the full stack trace before the change:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR:__main__] UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n

PR proposes two new features to how CI uses random data for testing:\r\n\r\n1. A 'with np_random_seed(NNN)' syntax to allow a single test to run with a set seed without forcing determinism on other tests in the same file, and\r\n2. A set_np_random_seed() util function to set the seed randomly and output that setting to the nosetests log file.  This permits a failure seen in a log file to be reproduced exactly.\r\n\r\nNumerous individual tests have been also made more robust.  Most often the failures were the result of the finite difference method gradient not matching the symbol's gradient at a point when the gradient was either large (e.g. cube-root) or discontinuous (e.g. max).  In other cases, tolerances needed to be added or increased.\r\n\r\nThe proposed new approach is demonstrated on a simple test file of three tests.  Assuming that the second test needs a set seed for robustness, the file might currently appear as:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_op1():\r\n    <op1 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op2():\r\n    np.random.seed(1234)\r\n    <op2 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op3():\r\n    <op3 test>\r\n```\r\nEven though test_op3() is OK with nondeterministic data, it will have only a single dataset because it is run after test_op2, which sets the seed.  Also, if test_op1() were to fail, there would be no way to reproduce the failure, except for running the test individually to produce a new and hopefully similar failure.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed approach, the test file becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset_np_random_seed()\r\n\r\ndef test_op1():\r\n    <op1 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op2():\r\n    with np_random_seed(1234):\r\n        <op2 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op3():\r\n    <op3 test>\r\n```\r\n\r\nset_np_random_seed() is in the global region of the test file and will set the seed differently for each run.  The value set will appear in the nosetests output.  The body of the test_op2 test now appears after the 'with np_random_seed(1234):' statement.  This has the effect of setting the seed before the test runs, then reinstating the rng state after the test is over (failed or passed).  Thus test_op3 will run with non-deterministic data.  Finally, if say test_op1() fails, the seed is known so the failure can be reproduced.  Further use of np.random.get_state() and np.random.set_state() can result in a modified test file that can be invoked as 'nosetests --verbose -s test_file.py:test_op1'. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Revert setup.py and add the code gen logic.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change makes the additional assumption that `libmxnet.so` can be loaded onto the current system. Before the change, the assumption is only on its existence.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Updated the NEWS.md to match release notes with updates from new PRs\r\n- [x] Added the 0.12.0 release tag to the NEWS.md. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe 0.12.0 tag does not exist at the moment but I believe this is the right way to do it since code must not be edited after RC. \r\nThere was a comment about not using the 0.11.0.rc*

Description ##\r\nThis PR provides new KVStore type with integration for NCCL communication library.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New `nccl` type of kvstore, using ncclReduce and ncclBcast\r\n- [x] `test_nccl.py` added to `tests/python/gpu`, but not enabled,  since NCCL is not present and enabled in CI\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here:\r\n  - NCCL KVStore requires the same set of devices to be used for all communications (as is the case in typical data parallel training)\r\n  - in NCCL KVStore push and pull are implemented using 2 steps - launching NCCL kernels in 1 step and synchronizing in the second step. This was made to enable seamless aggregation support - several reductions are scheduled before a

would be nice to have a HybridBlock with support for parameter sharing similar to the old BucketingModule. This PR implements that by adding an optional `key` and `key_setter`.\r\nThe caches for _op and _graph are specific to each key, while the parameter cache is the same for all keys.\r\n\r\nThe user defined key setter method is called at the beginning of `forward` and can be used to set the key based on the passed data (e.g. based on batch size or sequence length).\r\n\r\nIn the user defined `hybrid_forward` method the user can access the key via `self.key`. This is helpful, as once the Block is hybridized it is not anymore possible to access the shape in hybrid_forward.\r\n\r\nThis works and could be merged. But the design might not be optimal. So lets discuss here if you have any ideas for a better design.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, depending on the layout the following key_setters could be used:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef input_len_key_setter(layout):\r\n    # args[0] is data\r\n    # args[1] are states\r\n    t_dim = layout.find('T')\r\n    n_dim = layout.find('N')\r\n    LayoutKey = collections.namedtuple(\"LayoutKey\", [\"T\", \"N\"])\r\n    return lambda *args: LayoutKey(T=args[0].shape[t_dim], N = args[0].shape[n_dim])\r\n\r\n```","created_at":"2017-10-15T07:08:02Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T00:01:41Z","closed_at":"2017-10-16T01:45:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f961755a5fe921b3ed9fcfd0b7fb590de7eae7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/51b161a5a77fa504254ccedb22b84e7d58c57e48","head":{"label":"leezu:leezu-master","ref":"leezu-master","sha":"51b161a5a77fa504254ccedb22b84e7d58c57e48","user":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82283296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjI4MzI5Ng==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"leezu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leezu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to implement 'same' convolutions in MXNet and Gluon, which are implicitly used throughout literature (e.g., ResNet). See:\r\n- https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/\r\n- https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn/convolution\r\n- https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/2118\r\n\r\nWill discuss

\"const int SAME_FLAG = -1\" is temporary\r\n- No support for asymmetric padding to give sameness (e.g., even-sized kernels); *this seems a much deeper change to make, with questionable value*.\r\n- **Would appreciate thoughts on eventual API** (this PR demoes a minimal change; `padding=(..., -1, ...)` triggers imputation per index, unlike the coarser API of other frameworks)\r\n- **Would appreciate comments on if this is the right approach**
