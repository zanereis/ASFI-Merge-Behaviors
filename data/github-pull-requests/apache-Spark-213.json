What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the legacy fractional formatter is based on the implementation from Spark 2.4 which formats the input timestamp twice:\r\n```\r\n    val timestampString = ts.toString\r\n    val formatted = legacyFormatter.format(ts)\r\n```\r\nto strip trailing zeros.

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test \"format fraction of second\" in `TimestampFormatterSuite` + added test for timestamps before

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe can infer `IsNotNull` from some special equality join keys. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(a string, b string, c string) using parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(a string, b decimal(38, 18), c string) using parquet;\r\nSELECT t1.* FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON coalesce(t1.a, t1.b)=t2.a; -- case 1\r\nSELECT t1.* FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON CAST(t1.a AS DOUBLE)=CAST(t2.b AS DOUBLE); -- case 2\r\n```\r\nThe `coalesce(t1.a, t1.b)` or `CAST(t1.a AS DOUBLE)` may generate a lot of null values, which will lead to skew join.\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(5) Project [a#5, b#6, c#7]\r\n+- *(5) SortMergeJoin [coalesce(a#5, b#6)], [a#8], Inner\r\n   :- *(2) Sort [coalesce(a#5, b#6) ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(coalesce(a#5, b#6), 200), true, [id=#44]\r\n   :     +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(coalesce(a#5, b#6))\r\n   :        +- Scan hive default.t1 [a#5, b#6, c#7], HiveTableRelation `default`.`t1`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, [a#5, b#6, c#7], Statistics(sizeInBytes=8.0 EiB)\r\n   +- *(4) Sort [a#8 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#8, 200), true, [id=#52]\r\n         +- *(3) Filter isnotnull(a#8)\r\n            +- Scan hive default.t2 [a#8], HiveTableRelation `default`.`t2`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, [a#8, b#9, c#10], Statistics(sizeInBytes=8.0 EiB)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Avoid skew join in some cases.\r\n2. [Hive support this optimization](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/release-3.1.2/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/calcite/rules/HiveJoinAddNotNullRule.java).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test:\r\nCase1:\r\nBefore this PR | After this PR\r\n-- |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModified formatting of expected timestamp strings in the test `JavaBeanDeserializationSuite`.`testSpark22000` to correctly format timestamps with **zero** seconds fraction. Current implementation outputs `.0` but must be empty string. From SPARK-31820 failure:\r\n- should be `2020-05-25 12:39:17`\r\n- but incorrect expected string is `2020-05-25 12:39:17.0`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make `JavaBeanDeserializationSuite` stable, and avoid test failures like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28630#issuecomment-633695723\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a workaround `HTTP2_DISABLE=true` to the document and to update the K8s integration test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-31786 reported fabric8 kubernetes-client library fails to talk K8s 1.17.x client on Java 8u251+ environment. It's fixed at Apache Spark 3.0.0 by upgrading the library, but it turns out that we can not use the same way in `branch-2.4` (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28625)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This will provide a workaround at the document and testing environment.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR is irrelevant to Jenkins UT because it's only updating docs and integration tests. We need to the followings.\r\n- [x] Pass the Jenkins K8s IT with old JDK8 and K8s versions (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28638#issuecomment-633837179)\r\n- [x] Manually run K8s IT on K8s 1.17/Java 8u251+ with `export HTTP2_DISABLE=true`.\r\n\r\n**K8s v1.17.6 / JDK 1.8.0_252**\r\n```\r\nKubernetesSuite:\r\n- Run SparkPi with no resources\r\n- Run SparkPi with a very long application name.\r\n- Use SparkLauncher.NO_RESOURCE\r\n- Run SparkPi with a master URL without a scheme.\r\n- Run SparkPi with an argument.\r\n- Run SparkPi with custom labels, annotations, and environment variables.\r\n- Run extraJVMOptions check on driver\r\n- Run SparkRemoteFileTest using a remote data file\r\n- Run SparkPi with env and mount secrets.\r\n- Run PySpark on simple pi.py example\r\n- Run PySpark with Python2 to test a pyfiles example\r\n- Run PySpark with Python3 to test a pyfiles example\r\n- Run PySpark with memory customization\r\n- Run in client mode.\r\nRun completed in 5 minutes, 7 seconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 14\r\nSuites: completed 2, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 14, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests

PR BACKPORTS https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/695cb617d42507eded9c7e50bc7cd5333bbe6f83 TO BRANCH-3.0\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFive continuous pattern characters with 'G/M/L/E/u/Q/q' means Narrow-Text Style while we turn to use `java.time.DateTimeFormatterBuilder` since 3.0.0, which output the leading single letter of the value, e.g. `December` would be `D`. In Spark 2.4 they mean Full-Text Style.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we explicitly disable Narrow-Text Style for these pattern characters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, there will be a silent data change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, queries with datetime operations using datetime patterns, e.g. `G/M/L/E/u` will fail if the pattern length is 5 and other patterns, e,g. 'k', 'm' also can accept a certain number of letters.\r\n\r\n1. datetime patterns that are not supported by the new parser but the legacy will get SparkUpgradeException, e.g. \"GGGGG\", \"MMMMM\", \"LLLLL\", \"EEEEE\", \"uuuuu\", \"aa\", \"aaa\". 2 options are given to end-users, one is to use legacy mode, and the other is to follow the new online doc for correct datetime patterns\r\n\r\n2, datetime patterns that are not supported by both the new parser and the legacy, e.g.  \"QQQQQ\", \"qqqqq\",  will get IllegalArgumentException which is captured by Spark internally and results NULL to end-users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen loading DataFrames from JDBC datasource with Kerberos authentication, remote executors (yarn-client/cluster etc. modes) fail to establish a connection due to lack of Kerberos ticket or ability to generate it.\r\n\r\nThis is a real issue when trying to ingest data from kerberized data sources (SQL Server, Oracle) in enterprise environment where exposing simple authentication access is not an option due to IT policy issues.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added MS SQL support.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Added `MSSQLConnectionProvider`\r\n* Added `MSSQLConnectionProviderSuite`\r\n* Changed MS SQL JDBC driver to use the latest (test scope only)\r\n* Changed `MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite` docker image to use the latest\r\n* Added a version comment to `MariaDBConnectionProvider` to increase trackability\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing JDBC kerberos support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, now user is able to connect to MS SQL using kerberos.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Additional + existing unit tests\r\n* Existing integration tests\r\n* Test on cluster

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse the correct API in AlterTableRecoverPartition tests to modify the `RDD_PARALLEL_LISTING_THRESHOLD` conf.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing AlterTableRecoverPartitions test modify the RDD_PARALLEL_LISTING_THRESHOLD as a SQLConf using the withSQLConf API. But since, this is not a SQLConf, it is not overridden and so the test doesn't end up testing the required behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is UT Fix.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly adds two things.\r\n\r\n1. Real headless browser support for UI test\r\n2. A test suite using headless Chrome as one instance of  those browsers.\r\n\r\nAlso, for environment where Chrome and Chrome driver is not installed, `ChromeUITest` tag is added to filter out the test suite.\r\nBy default, test suites with `ChromeUITest` is disabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, there are two problems for UI test.\r\n1. Lots of tests especially JavaScript related ones are done manually.\r\nAppearance is better to be confirmed by our eyes but logic should be tested by test cases ideally.\r\n \r\n2. Compared to the real web browsers, HtmlUnit doesn't seem to support JavaScript enough.\r\nI added a JavaScript related test before for SPARK-31534 using HtmlUnit which is simple library based headless browser for test.\r\nThe test I added works somehow but some JavaScript related error is shown in unit-tests.log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n======= EXCEPTION START ========\r\nException class=[net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.javascript.JavaScriptException]\r\ncom.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.ScriptException: Error: TOOLTIP: Option \"sanitizeFn\" provided type \"window\" but expected type \"(null|function)\".

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Make more expressions extend `NullIntolerant`.\r\n2. Add a checker(in `ExpressionInfoSuite`) to identify whether the expression is `NullIntolerant`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid skew join if the join column has many null values and can improve query performance. For examples:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(c1 string, c2 string) USING parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(c1 string, c2 string) USING parquet;\r\nEXPLAIN SELECT t1.* FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON upper(t1.c1) =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `kubernetes-client` library to bring the JDK8 related fixes. Please note that JDK11 works fine without any problem.\r\n- https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/releases/tag/v4.9.2\r\n  - JDK8 always uses http/1.1 protocol (Prevent OkHttp from wrongly enabling http/2)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOkHttp \"wrongly\" detects the Platform as Jdk9Platform on JDK 8u251.\r\n- https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/2212\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61565751/why-am-i-not-able-to-run-sparkpi-example-on-a-kubernetes-k8s-cluster\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a workaround `export HTTP2_DISABLE=true` and `Downgrade JDK or K8s`, we had better avoid this problematic situation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This will recover the failures on JDK 8u252.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pass the Jenkins UT\r\n- [ ] Pass the Jenkins K8S IT with the K8s 1.13\r\n- [ ] Manual testing with K8s 1.17.3.","created_at":"2020-05-24T01:48:54Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T22:30:08Z","closed_at":"2020-05-24T02:54:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c178b5528d05277bc441541599c8794a2159b7bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8bbc46ab50690be41adb8bdb42656f17926ae4fd","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-31786-2.4","ref":"SPARK-31786-2.4","sha":"8bbc46ab50690be41adb8bdb42656f17926ae4fd","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-2.4","ref":"branch-2.4","sha":"1d1a2079a56de25b0d14dd57f458a0f3830a6e14","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix for [SPARK-31805](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31805): do not set the `group.id` consumer property when using the \"assign\" strategy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith secure Kafka blocker an application fails, because the auto-generated group id is not allowed by the broker:\r\n```text\r\norg.apache.kafka.common.errors.GroupAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access group: spark-kafka-relation-ecab045d-4ee6-425e-88a0-495d4100a013-driver-0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the \"assign\" strategy, consumer group is not used. Therefore the best fix is to exclude the `group.id` property from the consumer config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. When using \"assign\" strategy:\r\n1. No need to reconfigure the broker - to add the necessary group ids to ACL\r\n1. (since Spark 3.0.0) No need to provide a custom group id ([SPARK-26350](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26350)) or a custom prefix ([SPARK-26121](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26121))\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually:\r\n1. Rebuild the module:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    mvn install -pl :spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12\r\n    ```\r\n1. Rebuild my application with newly built `spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12`. My application does the following:\r\n    ```scala\r\n    val kafkaDf = spark.read\r\n      .format(\"kafka\")\r\n      // \"kafka.bootstrap.servers\" and SASL-specific options\r\n      .options(options)\r\n      .option(\"assign\", topicPartitionsJson)\r\n      .option(\"startingOffsets\", startingOffsetsJson)\r\n      .option(\"endingOffsets\", \"latest\")\r\n      .load()\r\n    ```\r\n1. Run my application with a secure Kafka broker and verify that it does not fail with \"GroupAuthorizationException: ...\" anymore.\r\n\r\nI did not manage to add unit tests, because I do not know, how to set up a secure Kafka broker. Unit tests in spark-sql-kafka-0-10 use the tool `KafkaTestUtils`. I am not sure if this tool is suitable to simulate a secure Kafka broker with ACLs.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-23T23:23:55Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T00:40:07Z","closed_at":"2020-11-10T00:40:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d08209af27c39b94880563569ee5cc52db2c20c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two things.\r\n\r\nReal headless browser support for HistoryServer tests.\r\nA test suite using headless Chrome as one instance of those browsers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe motivation is same as #28578 .\r\nIn the current master, there is a testcase for HistoryServer which uses Ajax so we need the support for HistoryServer tests.\r\n\r\nAlso this change is necessary to upgrade HtmlUnit (See #28585)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI tested with following patterns.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse `format()` methods for Java date-time types in `Row.jsonValue`. The PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28582 added the methods to avoid conversions to days and microseconds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid unnecessary overhead of converting Java date-time types to micros/days before formatting. Also formatters have to convert input micros/days back to Java types to pass instances to standard library API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests in `RowJsonSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-23T05:44:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:44:44Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T03:50:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b4427ca22e342f4cff0592797a5ab2eccf694ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28620/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28620/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28620/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1dac0ef36744b736927e67d139f0b21477fa1a3d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:toJson-format-Java-datetime-types","ref":"toJson-format-Java-datetime-types","sha":"1dac0ef36744b736927e67d139f0b21477fa1a3d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds functionality to consider the running tasks on decommission executors based on some config.\r\nIn spark-on-cloud , we sometimes already know that an executor won't be alive for more than fix amount of time. Ex- In AWS Spot nodes, once we get the notification, we know that a node will be gone in 120 seconds.\r\nSo if the running tasks on the decommissioning executors may run beyond currentTime+120 seconds, then they are candidate for speculation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently when an executor is decommission, we stop scheduling new tasks on those executors but the already running tasks keeps on running on them. Based on the cloud, we might know beforehand that an executor won't be alive for more than a preconfigured time. Different cloud providers gives different timeouts before they take away the nodes. For Ex- In case of AWS spot nodes, an executor won't be alive for more than 120 seconds. We can utilize this information in cloud environments and take better decisions about speculating the already running tasks on decommission executors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR adds a new config \"spark.executor.decommission.killInterval\" which they can explicitly set based on the cloud environment where they are running.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

Usage will become more apparent when the read side of the shuffle plugin tree is introduced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe've added a mock implementation of the shuffle plugin tree here, to prove that a Spark job using a different implementation of the plugin can use all of the plugin points for an alternative shuffle data storage solution. But we don't include it here, in order to minimize the diff and the code to review in this specific patch.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are no partition Commands, such as AlterTableAddPartition supported in DatasourceV2, it is widely used in mysql or hive or other datasources. Thus it is necessary to defined Partition API to support these Commands.\r\n\r\nWe defined the partition API as part of Table API, as it will change table data sometimes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRe-generate results of:\r\n- DateTimeBenchmark\r\n- CSVBenchmark\r\n- JsonBenchmark\r\n\r\nin the environment:\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance | r3.xlarge |\r\n| AMI | ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-20190722.1 (ami-06f2f779464715dc5) |\r\n| Java | OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_242 and OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.6+10 |\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28576 changed date-time parser. The `DateTimeBenchmark` should confirm that the PR didn't slow down date/timestamp parsing.\r\n2. CSV/JSON datasources are affected by the above PR too. This PR updates the benchmark results in the same environment as other benchmarks to have a base line for future optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running benchmarks via the script:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nimport os\r\nfrom sparktestsupport.shellutils import run_cmd\r\n\r\nbenchmarks = [\r\n    ['sql/test', 'org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.DateTimeBenchmark'],\r\n    ['sql/test', 'org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.CSVBenchmark'],\r\n    ['sql/test', 'org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.json.JsonBenchmark']\r\n]\r\n\r\nprint('Set SPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1')\r\nos.environ['SPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES'] = '1'\r\n\r\nfor b in benchmarks:\r\n    print(\"Run benchmark: %s\" % b[1])\r\n    run_cmd(['build/sbt', '%s:runMain %s' % (b[0], b[1])])\r\n```","created_at":"2020-05-22T16:25:19Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:44:42Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T15:00:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b799f529ab4f933a9c59ac34d6f1b214e4740fa8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/117b3d082162396070d03c5a92b8edfb163c3f59","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:missing-hour-year-benchmarks","ref":"missing-hour-year-benchmarks","sha":"117b3d082162396070d03c5a92b8edfb163c3f59","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the data source scan node stores all the paths in its metadata. The metadata is kept when a SparkPlan is converted into SparkPlanInfo. SparkPlanInfo can be used to construct the Spark plan graph in UI.\r\n\r\nHowever, the paths can be very large (e.g. it can be many partitions after partition pruning), while UI pages only require up to 100 bytes for the location metadata. We can reduce the paths stored in metadata to reduce memory usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReduce unnecessary memory cost.\r\nIn the heap dump of a driver, the SparkPlanInfo instances are quite large and it should be avoided:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/82642318-8f65de00-9bc2-11ea-9c9c-f05c2b0e1c49.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlease refer https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24634 to see rationalization of the issue.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new metric to count the number of inputs arrived later than watermark plus allowed delay. To make changes simpler, this patch doesn't count the exact number of input rows which are later than watermark plus allowed delay. Instead, this patch counts the inputs which are dropped in the logic of operator. The difference of twos are shown in streaming aggregation: to optimize the calculation, streaming aggregation \"pre-aggregates\" the input rows, and later checks the lateness against \"pre-aggregated\" inputs, hence the number might be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe new metric will be provided via two places:\r\n\r\n1. On Spark UI: check the metrics in stateful operator nodes in query execution details page in SQL tab\r\n2. On Streaming Query Listener: check \"numLateInputs\" in \"stateOperators\" in QueryProcessEvent.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDropping late inputs means that end users might not get expected outputs. Even end users may indicate the fact and tolerate the result (as that's what allowed lateness is for), but they should be able to observe whether the current value of allowed lateness drops inputs or not so that they can adjust the value.\r\n\r\nAlso, whatever the chance they have multiple of stateful operators in a single query, if Spark drops late inputs \"between\" these operators, it becomes \"correctness\" issue. Spark should disallow such possibility, but given we already provided the flexibility, at least we should provide the way to observe the correctness issue and decide whether they should make correction of their query or not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. End users will be able to retrieve the information of late inputs via two ways:\r\n\r\n1. SQL tab in Spark UI\r\n2. Streaming Query Listener\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs added & existing UTs are modified to reflect the change.\r\n\r\nAnd ran manual test reproducing SPARK-28094.\r\n\r\nI've picked the specific case on \"B outer C outer D\" which is enough to represent the \"intermediate late row\" issue due to global watermark.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/jammann/b58bfbe0f4374b89ecea63c1e32c8f17\r\n\r\nSpark logs warning message on the query which means SPARK-28074 is working correctly,\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/05/30 17:52:47 WARN UnsupportedOperationChecker: Detected pattern of possible 'correctness' issue due to global watermark. The query contains stateful operation which can emit rows older than the current watermark plus allowed late record delay, which are \"late rows\" in downstream stateful operations and these rows can be discarded.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to skip R image building and one R test during integration tests by using `--exclude-tags r`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nwe fail casting from numeric to timestamp by default.\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\ncasting from numeric to timestamp is not a  non-standard,meanwhile it may generate different result between spark and other systems,for example hive\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes,user cannot cast numeric to timestamp directly,user have to use the following function to achieve the same effect:TIMESTAMP_SECONDS/TIMESTAMP_MILLIS/TIMESTAMP_MICROS\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFive continuous pattern characters with 'G/M/L/E/u/Q/q' means Narrow-Text Style while we turn to use `java.time.DateTimeFormatterBuilder` since 3.0.0, which output the leading single letter of the value, e.g. `December` would be `D`. In Spark 2.4 they mean Full-Text Style.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we explicitly disable Narrow-Text Style for these pattern characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, there will be a silent data change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, queries with datetime operations using datetime patterns, e.g. `G/M/L/E/u` will fail if the pattern length is 5 and other patterns, e,g. 'k', 'm' also can accept a certain number of letters.\r\n\r\n1. datetime patterns that are not supported by the new parser but the legacy will get SparkUpgradeException, e.g. \"GGGGG\", \"MMMMM\", \"LLLLL\", \"EEEEE\", \"uuuuu\", \"aa\", \"aaa\". 2 options are given to end-users, one is to use legacy mode, and the other is to follow the new online doc for correct datetime patterns\r\n\r\n2, datetime patterns that are not supported by both the new parser and the legacy, e.g.  \"QQQQQ\", \"qqqqq\",  will get IllegalArgumentException which is captured by Spark internally and results NULL to end-users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nadd getMetrics in Evaluators to get the corresponding Metrics instance, so users can use it to get any of the metrics scores. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val trainer = new LinearRegression\r\n    val model = trainer.fit(dataset)\r\n    val predictions = model.transform(dataset)\r\n\r\n    val evaluator = new RegressionEvaluator()\r\n\r\n    val metrics = evaluator.getMetrics(predictions)\r\n    val rmse = metrics.rootMeanSquaredError\r\n    val r2 = metrics.r2\r\n    val mae = metrics.meanAbsoluteError\r\n    val variance = metrics.explainedVariance\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Evaluator.evaluate only access to one metrics, but most users may need to get multiple metrics. This PR adds getMetrics in all the Evaluators, so users can use it to get an instance of the corresponding Metrics to get any of the metrics they want. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Add getMetrics in Evaluators.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Get a RegressionMetrics, which can be used to get any of the regression\r\n   * metrics such as rootMeanSquaredError, meanSquaredError, etc.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param dataset a dataset that contains labels/observations and predictions.\r\n   * @return RegressionMetrics\r\n   */\r\n  @Since(\"3.1.0\")\r\n  def getMetrics(dataset: Dataset[_]): RegressionMetrics\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to only allow the import of `ResourceInformation` as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.resource.ResourceInformation\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of \r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark.ResourceInformation\r\npyspark.resource.ResourceInformation\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause `pyspark.resource` is a separate module, and it is documented so.\r\nThe constructor of `ResourceInformation` isn't supposed to directly call anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the code structure coherent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it will be in the unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via importing:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark\r\n>>> pyspark.ResourceInformation\r\n<class 'pyspark.resource.information.ResourceInformation'>\r\n>>> pyspark.resource.ResourceInformation\r\n<class 'pyspark.resource.information.ResourceInformation'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyspark\r\n>>> pyspark.ResourceInformation\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: module 'pyspark' has no attribute 'ResourceInformation'\r\n>>> pyspark.resource.ResourceInformation\r\n<class 'pyspark.resource.information.ResourceInformation'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tested via\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python3

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRevert https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28208 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24076 in branch 3.0\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnfortunately, the PR  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28208 is merged after Spark 3.0 RC 2 cut. Although the improvement is great, we can't break the policy to add new improvement commits into branch 3.0 now.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we are going to adopt the improvement in a future release, we should not release 3.0 with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24076, since the API result will be changed.\r\n\r\nAfter discuss with @cloud-fan and @gatorsmile offline, we think the best choice is to revert both commits and follow community release policy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, let's hold the SQL rest API until next release.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR partially backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28569.\r\n\r\n1.. Rename \r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n└── resourceinformation.py\r\n    └── class ResourceInformation\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n└── resource.py\r\n    └── class ResourceInformation\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the `ResourceInformation` is consistently imported via `pyspark.resource.ResourceInformation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.. Document the new `pyspark.resource` module\r\n\r\n3.. Minor docstring fix e.g.:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-     @param name the name of the resource\r\n-     @param addresses an array of strings describing the addresses of the resource\r\n+     :param name: the name of the resource\r\n+     :param addresses: an array of strings describing the addresses of the resource\r\n+\r\n+     .. versionadded:: 3.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo document APIs, and move Python modules to fewer and simpler modules.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the changes are in unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python3 --modules=pyspark-core\r\n```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-20T03:17:31Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:40Z","closed_at":"2020-05-20T04:40:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"968b445fbbab0aee6835cea7c69f8cb00bf28901","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1079220509de19c889ce2a24683dc8e917a48bb1","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-31748","ref":"SPARK-31748","sha":"1079220509de19c889ce2a24683dc8e917a48bb1","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Borrow the code for formatting of `java.sql.Timestamp` from Spark 2.4 `DateTimeUtils.timestampToString` to `FractionTimestampFormatter` because legacy formatters don't support variable length patterns for seconds fractions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid unnecessary overhead of converting Java date-time types to micros/days before formatting. Also formatters have to convert input micros/days back to Java types to pass instances to standard library API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests for toHiveString and new tests in `TimestampFormatterSuite`.","created_at":"2020-05-19T19:56:13Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:49:41Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T04:01:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebf284c5de8471d466a2b989f66ef2722c72ac4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31e8ffdcedfc417909f842f469c3e86889a8af42","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:opt-format-old-types","ref":"opt-format-old-types","sha":"31e8ffdcedfc417909f842f469c3e86889a8af42","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nin `spark-daemon.sh`, `spark_rotate_log()` accepts `$2` as a custom setting for the number of maximum rotate log files, but this part of code is actually never used.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `SPARK_LOG_MAX_FILES` environment variable to represent the maximum log files of Spark daemons can rotate to.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nthe logs files that all spark daemons are hardcoded as 5, but it supposed to be configurable\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nyes, SPARK_LOG_MAX_FILES is added to represent the maximum log files of Spark daemons can rotate to. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nverify locally for the added shell script:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n kentyao@hulk 

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe function `HistoryServerDiskManager`.`updateAccessTime()` would recompute the application store directory size every time it's triggered, this effort could be avoided because we already computed the new size outside the function call.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly adds two things.\r\n\r\n1. Real headless browser support for UI test\r\n2. A test suite using headless Chrome as one instance of  those browsers.\r\n\r\nAlso, for environment where Chrome and Chrome driver is not installed, `ChromeUITest` tag is added to filter out the test suite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, there are two problems for UI test.\r\n1. Lots of tests especially JavaScript related ones are done manually.\r\nAppearance is better to be confirmed by our eyes but logic should be tested by test cases ideally.\r\n \r\n2. Compared to the real web browsers, HtmlUnit doesn't seem to support JavaScript enough.\r\nI added a JavaScript related test before for SPARK-31534 using HtmlUnit which is simple library based headless browser for test.\r\nThe test I added works somehow but some JavaScript related error is shown in unit-tests.log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n======= EXCEPTION START ========\r\nException class=[net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.javascript.JavaScriptException]\r\ncom.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.ScriptException: Error: TOOLTIP: Option \"sanitizeFn\" provided type \"window\" but expected type \"(null|function)\".

is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28463 from Apache Spark master/3.0 to 2.4.\r\nMinor adaptation include:\r\n- Retain the Spark 2.4-specific behavior of skipping the indylambda check when using Scala 2.11\r\n- Remove unnecessary LMF restrictions in ClosureCleaner tests\r\n- Address review comments in the original PR from @kiszk \r\n\r\nTested with the default Scala 2.11 build, and also tested ClosureCleaner-related tests in Scala 2.12 build as well:\r\n- repl: `SingletonReplSuite`\r\n- core: `ClosureCleanerSuite` and `ClosureCleanerSuite2`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enhance Spark's `ClosureCleaner` to support \"indylambda\" style of Scala closures to the same level as the existing implementation for the old (inner class) style ones. The goal is to reach feature parity with the support of the old style Scala closures, with as close to bug-for-bug compatibility as possible.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR addresses one lacking support for indylambda closures vs the inner class closures:\r\n- When a closure is declared in a Scala REPL and captures the enclosing REPL line object, such closure should be cleanable (unreferenced fields on the enclosing REPL line object should be cleaned)\r\n\r\nThis PR maintains the same limitations in the new indylambda closure support as the old inner class closures, in particular the following two:\r\n- Cleaning is only available for one level of REPL line object. If a closure captures state from a REPL line object further out from the immediate enclosing one, it won't be subject to cleaning. See example below.\r\n- \"Sibling\" closures are not handled yet. A \"sibling\" closure is defined here as a closure that is directly or indirectly referenced by the starting closure, but isn't lexically enclosing. e.g.\r\n  ```scala\r\n  {\r\n    val siblingClosure = (x: Int) => x + this.fieldA   // captures `this`, references `fieldA` on `this`.\r\n    val startingClosure = (y: Int) => y + this.fieldB + siblingClosure(y)  // captures `this` and `siblingClosure`, references `fieldB` on `this`.\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThe changes are intended to be minimal, with further code cleanups planned in separate PRs.\r\n\r\nJargons:\r\n- old, inner class style Scala closures, aka `delambdafy:inline`: default in Scala 2.11 and before\r\n- new, \"indylambda\" style Scala closures, aka `delambdafy:method`: default in Scala 2.12 and later\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere had been previous effortsto extend Spark's `ClosureCleaner` to support \"indylambda\" Scala closures, which is necessary for proper Scala 2.12 support. Most notably the work done for [SPARK-14540](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14540).\r\n\r\nBut the previous efforts had missed one import scenario: a Scala closure declared in a Scala REPL, and it captures the enclosing `this` -- a REPL line object. e.g. in a Spark Shell:\r\n```scala\r\n:pa\r\nclass NotSerializableClass(val x: Int)\r\nval ns = new NotSerializableClass(42)\r\nval topLevelValue = \"someValue\"\r\nval func = (j: Int) => {\r\n  (1 to j).flatMap { x =>\r\n    (1 to x).map { y => y + topLevelValue }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<Ctrl+D>\r\nsc.parallelize(0 to 2).map(func).collect\r\n```\r\nIn this example, `func` refers to a Scala closure that captures the enclosing `this` because it needs to access `topLevelValue`, which is in turn implemented as a field on the enclosing REPL line object.\r\n\r\nThe existing `ClosureCleaner` in Spark supports cleaning this case in Scala 2.11-, and this PR brings feature parity to Scala 2.12+.\r\n\r\nNote that the existing cleaning logic only supported one level of REPL line object nesting. This PR does not go beyond that. When a closure references state declared a few commands earlier, the cleaning will fail in both Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12. e.g.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> :pa\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nclass NotSerializableClass1(val x: Int)\r\ncase class Foo(id: String)\r\nval ns = new NotSerializableClass1(42)\r\nval topLevelValue = \"someValue\"\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\n\r\ndefined class NotSerializableClass1\r\ndefined class Foo\r\nns: NotSerializableClass1 = NotSerializableClass1@615b1baf\r\ntopLevelValue: String = someValue\r\n\r\nscala> :pa\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nval closure2 = (j: Int) => {\r\n  (1 to j).flatMap { x =>\r\n    (1 to x).map { y => y + topLevelValue } // 2 levels\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\n\r\nclosure2: Int => scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[String] = <function1>\r\n\r\nscala> sc.parallelize(0 to 2).map(closure2).collect\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Task not serializable\r\n...\r\n```\r\nin the Scala 2.11 / Spark 2.4.x case:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: NotSerializableClass1\r\nSerialization stack:\r\n\t- object not serializable (class: NotSerializableClass1, value: NotSerializableClass1@615b1baf)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: ns, type: class NotSerializableClass1)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@64df3f4b)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@66e6e5e9)\r\n\t- field (class: $line14.$read, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $line14.$read, $line14.$read@c310aa3)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $line14$read, type: class $line14.$read)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@79224636)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $outer, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@636d4cdc)\r\n\t- field (class: $anonfun$1, name: $outer, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $anonfun$1, <function1>)\r\n```\r\nin the Scala 2.12 / Spark 2.4.x case after this PR:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: NotSerializableClass1\r\nSerialization stack:\r\n\t- object not serializable (class: NotSerializableClass1, value: NotSerializableClass1@6f3b4c9a)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: ns, type: class NotSerializableClass1)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@2945a3c1)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@152705d0)\r\n\t- field (class: $line14.$read, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $line14.$read, $line14.$read@7cf311eb)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $line14$read, type: class $line14.$read)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@d980dac)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $outer, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@557d9532)\r\n\t- element of array (index: 0)\r\n\t- array (class [Ljava.lang.Object;, size 1)\r\n\t- field (class: java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda, name: capturedArgs, type: class [Ljava.lang.Object;)\r\n\t- object (class java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda, SerializedLambda[capturingClass=class $iw, functionalInterfaceMethod=scala/Function1.apply:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;, implementation=invokeStatic $anonfun$closure2$1$adapted:(L$iw;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/immutable/IndexedSeq;, instantiatedMethodType=(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/immutable/IndexedSeq;, numCaptured=1])\r\n\t- writeReplace data (class: java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda)\r\n\t- object (class $Lambda$2103/815179920, $Lambda$2103/815179920@569b57c4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more background of the new and old ways Scala lowers closures to Java bytecode, please see [A note on how NSC (New Scala Compiler) lowers lambdas](https://gist.github.com/rednaxelafx/e9ecd09bbd1c448dbddad4f4edf25d48#file-notes-md).\r\n\r\nFor more background on how Spark's `ClosureCleaner` works and what's needed to make it support \"indylambda\" Scala closures, please refer to [A Note on Apache Spark's ClosureCleaner](https://gist.github.com/rednaxelafx/e9ecd09bbd1c448dbddad4f4edf25d48#file-spark_closurecleaner_notes-md).\r\n\r\n#### tl;dr\r\n\r\nThe `ClosureCleaner` works like a mark-sweep algorithm on fields:\r\n- Finding (a chain of) outer objects referenced by the starting closure;\r\n- Scanning the starting closure and its inner closures and marking the fields on the outer objects accessed;\r\n- Cloning the outer objects, nulling out fields that are not accessed by any closure of concern.\r\n\r\n##### Outer Objects\r\n\r\nFor the old, inner class style Scala closures, the \"outer objects\" is defined as the lexically enclosing closures of the starting closure, plus an optional enclosing REPL line object if these closures are defined in a Scala REPL. All of them are on a singly-linked `$outer` chain.\r\n\r\nFor the new, \"indylambda\" style Scala closures, the capturing implementation changed, so closures no longer refer to their enclosing closures via an `$outer` chain. However, a closure can still capture its enclosing REPL line object, much like the old style closures. The name of the field that captures this reference would be `arg$1` (instead of `$outer`).\r\n\r\nSo what's missing in the `ClosureCleaner` for the \"indylambda\" support is find and potentially clone+clean the captured enclosing `this` REPL line object. That's what this PR implements.\r\n\r\n##### Inner Closures\r\n\r\nThe old, inner class style of Scala closures are compiled into separate inner classes, one per lambda body. So in order to discover the implementation (bytecode) of the inner closures, one has to jump over multiple classes. The name of such a class would contain the marker substring `$anonfun$`.\r\n\r\nThe new, \"indylambda\" style Scala closures are compiled into **static methods** in the class where the lambdas were declared. So for lexically nested closures, their lambda bodies would all be compiled into static methods **in the same class**. This makes it much easier to discover the implementation (bytecode) of the nested lambda bodies. The name of such a static method would contain the marker substring `$anonfun$`.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of inner closures involves scanning bytecode for certain patterns that represent the creation of a closure object for the inner closure.\r\n- For inner class style: the closure object creation site is like `new <InnerClassForTheClosure>(captured args)`\r\n- For \"indylambda\" style: the closure object creation site would be compiled into an `invokedynamic` instruction, with its \"bootstrap method\" pointing to the same one used by Java 8 for its serializable lambdas, and with the bootstrap method arguments pointing to the implementation method.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Before this PR, Spark 2.4 / 3.0 / master on Scala 2.12 would not support Scala closures declared in a Scala REPL that captures anything from the REPL line objects. After this PR, such scenario is supported.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test case to `org.apache.spark.repl.SingletonReplSuite`. The new test case fails without the fix in this PR, and pases with the fix.\r\n\r\nCloses #28463 from rednaxelafx/closure-cleaner-indylambda.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Kris Mok

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new rule to support push predicate through join by rewriting join condition to CNF(conjunctive normal form). The following example is the steps of this rule:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare Table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE x AS SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1, 2, 3, 4)) AS x(a, b, c, d);\r\nCREATE TABLE y AS SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1, 2, 3, 4)) AS x(a, b, c, d);\r\nEXPLAIN SELECT x.* FROM x JOIN y ON ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3 AND y.b = 1) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5 AND y.b = 2));\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Convert the join condition to CNF:\r\n\r\nStep | Current condition\r\n--- | ---\r\ninit | (x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3 AND y.b = 1) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5 AND y.b = 2)\r\nstep 1 | ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5 AND y.b = 2)) AND ((y.b = 1) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5 AND y.b = 2))\r\nstep 2 | ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5)) AND ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (y.b = 2)) AND ((y.b = 1) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5 AND y.b = 2))\r\nstep 3 | ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5)) AND ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (y.b = 2)) AND ((y.b = 1) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5)) AND ((y.b = 1) OR (y.b = 2))\r\n\r\n3. Split conjunctive predicates\r\n\r\nPredicates\r\n---|\r\n((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5))\r\n((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (y.b = 2))\r\n((y.b = 1) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5))\r\n((y.b = 1) OR (y.b = 2))\r\n\r\n4. Push predicate\r\n\r\nTable | Predicate\r\n--- | ---\r\nx | ((x.a > 1 AND x.a < 3) OR (x.a > 3 AND x.a < 5))\r\ny | ((y.b = 1) OR (y.b = 2))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove query performance. PostgreSQL, [Impala](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-9183) and Hive support this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test and benchmark test.\r\n\r\n\r\nSQL | Before this PR | After this PR\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nTPCDS 5T Q13 | 84s | 21s\r\nTPCDS 5T q85 | 66s | 34s\r\nTPCH 1T q19 | 37s |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs we know,long datatype is interpreted as milliseconds when conversion to timestamp in hive, while long is interpreted as seconds when conversion to timestamp in spark, we have been facing error data during migrating hive sql to spark sql. with compatibility flag we can fix this error,\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nwe have many sqls runing in product, so we need a compatibility flag to make them migrating smoothly ,meanwhile do not change the user behavior in spark.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nif user use this patch ,then user should set this paramter ,\r\nif not, user do not need to do anything.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test

changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs we know,long datatype is interpreted as milliseconds when conversion to timestamp in hive, while long is interpreted as seconds when conversion to timestamp in spark, we have been facing error data during migrating hive sql to spark sql. with compatibility flag we can fix this error,\r\n\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\nwe have many sqls runing in product, so we need a compatibility flag to make them migrating smoothly ,meanwhile do not change the user behavior in spark.\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nif user use this patch ,then user should set this paramter ,\r\nif not, user do not need to do anything.\r\n\r\nHow was this patch tested?\r\nunit test added\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-18T10:02:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T14:52:38Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T12:57:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22a86f05dc7b3a2573a94dd9643188b7c338a7d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0557f7397328398b80236fed56ed5a6cb3ca3164","head":{"label":"tongcheng-elong:GuoPhilipse-patch-SPARK-31710","ref":"GuoPhilipse-patch-SPARK-31710","sha":"0557f7397328398b80236fed56ed5a6cb3ca3164","user":{"login":"tongcheng-elong","id":46740762,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2NzQwNzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46740762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong","html_url":"https://github.com/tongcheng-elong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":257867756,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTc4Njc3NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"tongcheng-elong/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tongcheng-elong","id":46740762,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2NzQwNzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46740762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong","html_url":"https://github.com/tongcheng-elong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tongcheng-elong/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tongcheng-elong/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is kind of a followup for SPARK-29641 and SPARK-28234. This PR proposes:\r\n\r\n1.. Document the new `pyspark.resource` module introduced at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/95aec091e4d8a45e648ce84d32d912f585eeb151, in PySpark API docs.\r\n\r\n2.. Move classes into fewer and simpler modules\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n├── resource\r\n│   ├── executorrequests.py\r\n│   │   ├── class ExecutorResourceRequest \r\n│   │   └── class ExecutorResourceRequests\r\n│   ├── taskrequests.py\r\n│   │   ├── class TaskResourceRequest \r\n│   │   └── class TaskResourceRequests\r\n│   ├── resourceprofilebuilder.py\r\n│   │   └── class ResourceProfileBuilder\r\n│   ├── resourceprofile.py\r\n│   │   └── class ResourceProfile\r\n└── resourceinformation.py\r\n    └── class ResourceInformation\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n└── resource\r\n    ├── requests.py\r\n    │   ├── class ExecutorResourceRequest \r\n    │   ├── class ExecutorResourceRequests\r\n    │   ├── class TaskResourceRequest \r\n    │   └── class TaskResourceRequests\r\n    ├── profile.py\r\n    │   ├── class ResourceProfileBuilder\r\n    │   └── class ResourceProfile\r\n    └── information.py\r\n        └── class ResourceInformation\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.. Minor docstring fix e.g.:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-     @param name the name of the resource\r\n-     @param addresses an array of strings describing the addresses of the resource\r\n+     :param name: the name of the resource\r\n+     :param addresses: an array of strings describing the addresses of the resource\r\n+\r\n+     .. versionadded:: 3.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo document APIs, and move Python modules to fewer and simpler modules.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the changes are in unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python3 --modules=pyspark-core\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python3 --modules=pyspark-resource\r\n```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-18T09:05:37Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:41Z","closed_at":"2020-05-20T00:09:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f2f7d08527a9435a7520ef333cf80d5825991849","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28569/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28569/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28569/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6beeca79435cbfe6c1acecf8eb898efe84faf1f4","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28234-SPARK-29641-followup","ref":"SPARK-28234-SPARK-29641-followup","sha":"6beeca79435cbfe6c1acecf8eb898efe84faf1f4","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nAs we know,long datatype is interpreted as milliseconds when conversion to timestamp in hive, while long is interpreted as seconds when conversion to timestamp in spark, we have been facing error data during migrating hive sql to spark sql. with compatibility flag we can fix this error,\r\n\r\n**Why are the changes needed?**\r\nwe have many sqls runing in product, so we need a compatibility flag to make them migrating smoothly ,meanwhile do not change the user behavior in spark.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nif user use this patch ,then user should set this paramter ,\r\nif not, user do not need to do anything.\r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nunit test

PR introduces a change to false for the insideComment flag on a newline. Fixing the issue introduced by SPARK-30049. \r\n\r\nBackport to 3.0 from #27920 \r\n\r\nPreviously on SPARK-30049 a comment containing an unclosed quote produced the following issue:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT 1 -- someone's comment here\r\n         > ;\r\nError in query:\r\nextraneous input ';' expecting <EOF>(line 2, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSELECT 1 -- someone's comment here\r\n;\r\n^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was caused because there was no flag for comment sections inside the splitSemiColon method to ignore quotes. SPARK-30049 added that flag and fixed the issue, but introduced the follwoing problem:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select\r\n         >   1,\r\n         >   -- two\r\n         >   2;\r\nError in query:\r\nmismatched input '<EOF>' expecting {'(', 'ADD', 'AFTER', 'ALL', 'ALTER', ...}(line 3, pos 2)\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect\r\n  1,\r\n--^^^\r\n```\r\nThis issue is generated by a missing turn-off for the insideComment flag with a newline.\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n- For previous tests using line-continuity(`\\`) it was added a line-continuity rule in the SqlBase.g4 file to add the functionality to the SQL context.\r\n- A new test for inline comments was added.\r\n\r\nCloses #27920 from javierivanov/SPARK-31102.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Javier Fuentes <j.fuentes.m@icloud.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to remove Hive profile in SparkR build at AppVeyor in order to:\r\n- Speed up the build. Currently, SparkR build is [reaching the time limit](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark/builds/32853533).\r\n- Clean up the build profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe're hitting a time limit issue again and this PR could reduce the build time.\r\n\r\nSeems like we're [already skipping Hive related tests in SparkR](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark/builds/32853533) for some reasons, see below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:307: skip: create DataFrame from RDD\r\nReason: Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:1341: skip: test HiveContext\r\nReason: Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:2813: skip: read/write ORC files\r\nReason: Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:2834: skip: read/write ORC files - compression option\r\nReason: Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:3727: skip: enableHiveSupport on SparkSession\r\nReason: Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough we build with Hive profile. So, the Hive profile is useless here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAppVeyor will test it

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we only push nested column pruning from a Project through a few operators such as LIMIT, SAMPLE, etc. There are a few operators like Aggregate, Expand which can prune nested columns by themselves, without a Project on top.\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the feature to those operators.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently nested column pruning only applied on a few cases. It limits the benefit of nested column pruning. Extending nested column pruning coverage to make this feature more generally applied through different queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. More SQL operators are covered by nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test, end-to-end tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-17T21:33:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:23:46Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T09:08:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5ba2a2bd2d3ce97fb3a08e871374b17abed1688","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b2e56d55fe1dda39a47ba654e2b60a81fea7e492","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-27217-2","ref":"SPARK-27217-2","sha":"b2e56d55fe1dda39a47ba654e2b60a81fea7e492","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we only push nested column pruning through a few operators such as LIMIT, SAMPLE, etc. This patch extends the feature to other operators including RepartitionByExpression, Join.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently nested column pruning only applied on a few operators. It limits the benefit of nested column pruning. Extending nested column pruning coverage to make this feature more generally applied through different queries. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. More SQL operators are covered by nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test, end-to-end

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to recover Hadoop-3.2 profile jobs on `master` branch by disabling a UT added by SPARK-31235 in Hadoop 3.2 temporarily. The target UT is not a flaky test. It always fail on Hadoop-3.2 profile currently although it works in Hadoop 2.7 profile. So, in this PR, we keep the test coverage in Hadoop 2.7 and ignore the test in Hadoop 3.2 temporarily to unblock the other PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-31235 added a test case which is breaking Hadoop 3.2 and there are two follow-up to fix it. Although two follow-ups can fix the UT in Hadoop 3.2 environment. The side-effect on Hadoop classes cause some random UT failures in the other suites.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28456\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28550\r\n\r\n### Does

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange timestamp casting to int in ANSI and non-codegen mode, and make the error message consistent to the error messages in the codegen mode. In particular, casting to int is implemented in the same way as casting to short and byte.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The error message in the non-codegen mode is diversed from the error message in the codegen mode.\r\n2. The error message contains intermediate results that could confuse.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, the error message of casting timestamp to int contains intermediate result but after the changes it contains the input values which causes arithmetic overflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite `AnsiCastSuite`.","created_at":"2020-05-15T20:58:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:49:32Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T05:01:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fc7d9eb1ff5384ad583d58e4756ce0dedc64d73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f561971cb624ffffb721a73429ab37b32580eda7","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-error-msg-cast-timestamp","ref":"fix-error-msg-cast-timestamp","sha":"f561971cb624ffffb721a73429ab37b32580eda7","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to adapt Spark REPL to Scala 2.13. \r\n\r\nIt is based on a [scala-2.13 branch](https://github.com/smarter/spark/tree/scala-2.13) made by @smarter.\r\n\r\nI had to set Scala version to 2.13 in some places, and to adapt some other modules, before I could start working on the REPL itself. These are separate commits on the branch that probably would be fixed beforehand, and thus dropped before the merge of this PR.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a way to run the initialization code with existing REPL classes in Scala 2.13.2, so I [modified REPL in Scala](https://github.com/karolchmist/scala/commit/e9cc0dd54787351587237bbbee37d23ee744894c) to make it work. With this modification I managed to run Spark Shell, along with the units tests passing, which is good news. \r\n\r\nThe bad news is that it requires an upstream change in Scala, which must be accepted first. I'd be happy to change it if someone points a way to do it differently. If not, I'd propose a PR in Scala to introduce `ILoop.internalReplAutorunCode`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nREPL in Scala changed quite a lot, so current version of Spark REPL needed to be adapted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIn the previous version of `SparkILoop`, a lot of Scala's `ILoop` code was [overridden and duplicated](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/2bc7b75537ec81184048738883b282e257cc58de) to make the welcome message a bit more pleasant. In this PR, the message is in a bit different order, but it's still acceptable IMHO.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n20/05/15 15:32:39 WARN Utils: Your hostname, hermes resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.1.1; using 192.168.1.28 instead (on interface enp0s31f6)\r\n20/05/15 15:32:39 WARN Utils: Set SPARK_LOCAL_IP if you need to bind to another address\r\n20/05/15 15:32:39 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).
