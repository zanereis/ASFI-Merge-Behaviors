`archunit.version` from 0.22.0 to 0.23.1.\nUpdates `archunit-junit5-api` from 0.22.0 to 0.23.1\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/releases\">archunit-junit5-api's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>ArchUnit 0.23.1</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix exception <code>Never found a JavaCodeUnit that matches supposed origin...</code> occurring with Kotlin inline functions where the descriptor of a method deviates from the signature (this was introduced by checking the return type of the method as well when looking for a call origin in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/714\">#714</a>; see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/804\">#804</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/807\">#807</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix optional layers of <code>LayeredArchitecture</code> failing with the new default behavior <code>archRule.failOnEmptyShould = true</code> (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/809\">#809</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/oberprah\"><code>@​oberprah</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Log automatic resolution configuration on debug to reduce log clutter (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/802\">#802</a>)</li>\n<li>Add new Method <code>ArchRule.allowEmptyShould(boolean)</code> to override the configured <code>archRule.failOnEmptyShould</code> configuration on a per rule basis (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/803\">#803</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/806\">#806</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/808\">#808</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/oberprah\"><code>@​oberprah</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ArchUnit 0.23.0</h2>\n<h1>Breaking Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned in Enhancements/Core <code>ArchRules</code> will now by default reject evaluating if the set passed to the <code>should</code>-clause is empty. This will break existing rules that don't check any elements in their <code>should</code>-clause. You can restore the old behavior by setting the ArchUnit property <code>archRule.failOnEmptyShould=false</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix wrong origins of <code>JavaCall</code> in case of bridge methods. If a class had two methods with the exact same name and parameter types the <code>origin</code> of a <code>JavaCall</code> was picked randomly from them. It now always picks the non-synthetic method (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/513\">#513</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix non-deterministic return value of <code>JavaCodeUnit.getMethod()</code>. In case of bridge methods there might be more than one method matching the exact same name and parameters. In these cases the result of <code>getMethod()</code> was random. It now always picks the non-synthetic method (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/256\">#256</a>)</li>\n<li><code>layeredArchitecture()</code> will now allow to combine <code>mayOnlyBeAccessedBy...</code> and <code>mayOnlyAccess...</code>. Previously <code>mayOnlyAccess...</code> would forbid all incoming dependencies (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/739\">#739</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/hankem\"><code>@​hankem</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<h2>Core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Members targeted by <code>AccessTarget</code> are now resolved like the Java Reflection API would do it. Previously <code>AccessTarget.resolve()</code> would return a set of matching members, the new replacement <code>AccessTarget.resolveMember()</code> returns an optional member making it a lot easier to handle (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/722\">#722</a>)</li>\n<li><code>JavaClass</code> now knows its <code>methodReferencesFromSelf</code> (e.g. <code>Object::toString</code>) and <code>constructorReferencesFromSelf</code> (e.g. <code>Object::new</code>) (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/215\">#215</a>; thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/KorSin\"><code>@​KorSin</code></a>)</li>\n<li><code>ArchRules</code> will now by default reject evaluating if the set passed to the <code>should</code>-clause is empty.

This will break existing rules that don't check any elements in their <code>should</code>-clause. You can restore the old behavior by setting the ArchUnit property <code>archRule.failOnEmptyShould=false</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix wrong origins of <code>JavaCall</code> in case of bridge methods. If a class had two methods with the exact same name and parameter types the <code>origin</code> of a <code>JavaCall</code> was picked randomly from them. It now always picks the non-synthetic method (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/513\">#513</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix non-deterministic return value of <code>JavaCodeUnit.getMethod()</code>. In case of bridge methods there might be more than one method matching the exact same name and parameters. In these cases the result of <code>getMethod()</code> was random. It now always picks the non-synthetic method (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/TNG/ArchUnit/issues/256\">#256</a>)</li>\n<li><code>layeredArchitecture()</code> will now allow to combine <code>mayOnlyBeAccessedBy...</code> and <code>mayOnlyAccess...</code>.

4.6.2.</p>\n<p>This release includes bugfixes and enhancements. Many improvements in the documentation.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the many people in the picocli community for raising issues and contributing pull requests to fix issues!</p>\n<p>From this release, picocli uses system properties <code>sun.stdout.encoding</code> and <code>sun.stderr.encoding</code> when creating the <code>PrintWriters</code> returned by  <code>CommandLine::getOut</code> and <code>CommandLine::getErr</code>. When these system properties do not exist, picocli falls back to the default charset (determined by <code>file.encoding</code>). This addresses an issue on Windows, where the default charset is not the same as the encoding for its console (often the older <code>cp437</code> codepage on English-language versions of Windows).</p>\n<p>Note that these system properties <a href=\"https://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-jvm-encoding.html\">seem to have been</a> introduced in Java 8 (although I cannot find it in the JDK 8 release notes) and may not exist on earlier JVMs or on JVMs other than the Oracle and OpenJDK implementations.</p>\n<p>This is the seventy-seventh public release.\nPicocli follows <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">semantic versioning</a>.</p>\n<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Table of Contents</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"%5B#4%5D(https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/remkop/picocli/issues/4).6.2-new\">New and noteworthy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"%5B#4%5D(https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/remkop/picocli/issues/4).6.2-fixes\">Fixed issues</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"%5B#4%5D(https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/remkop/picocli/issues/4).6.2-deprecated\">Deprecations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"%5B#4%5D(https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/remkop/picocli/issues/4).6.2-breaking-changes\">Potential breaking changes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> New and Noteworthy</h2>\n<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Fixed issues</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/remkop/picocli/issues/1422\">#1422</a> API: Un-deprecate the <code>@Option</code> <code>help</code> attribute; it is useful for custom help options.
