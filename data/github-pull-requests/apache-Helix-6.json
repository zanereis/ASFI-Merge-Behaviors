Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Write a concise description: \"what?, why?, how?\" and then add some details about this PR, including screenshots of any UI changes -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This PR fixes this Helix issue & includes the Helix issue in the PR description. Link your issue number here: You can write `Fix #123`.  See https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug that occurs because the request body is now [ignored silently by the Angular http library if it is passed as stringified JSON](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35874339/1732222).  Now, all request bodies are passed as objects, which the Angular http library then stringifies itself.\r\n\r\nThis PR also passes the http response status code from the **helix-front** web server to the UI, so that response codes from the **helix-rest** like `400 Bad Request` are shown in the UI.  This helps the user better understand what is going wrong.\r\n\r\nThis PR also ensures that the response sent from **helix-front** to **helix-rest**  is identical to the working curl request. \r\n\r\nHere is the desired payload format, modeled after the working curl request:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"my-test-cluster\",\r\n  \"mapFields\": { \"TEST_FIELD\": { \"test_sub_field\": 18 } }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the bug format seen before, which differed slightly from the curl request:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"my-test-cluster\",\r\n  \"mapFields\": { \"TEST_FIELD\": { \"test_sub_field\": \"18\" } },\r\n  \"listFields\": {},\r\n  \"simpleFields\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the following differences:\r\n\r\n1. properties with empty object values are included \r\n2. the number value of `\"test_sub_field\"` is a string, not a number. \r\n\r\nFix #2221\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n<!-- List the names of new unit or integration tests -->\r\n\r\nTODO: add a test for this case.\r\n\r\n### Code Style\r\n\r\n<!-- Ensure the PR diff has been formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io) -->\r\n\r\nFormatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io)\r\n\r\n<!-- ### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include: -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nResolves #2220.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis commit includes several efforts in order to bump up zookeeper version:\r\n1. Upgrade zookeeper version to 3.6.3 in pom.xml and ivy file\r\n2. Add snappy-java dependency to helix-core\r\n3. Some code change in ZKLogFormatter to fix the differences in SerializeUtils class between zk version 3.5.9 and 3.6.3\r\n4. Due to the change of zookeeper server shutdown mode ([link](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/722ba9409a44a35d287aac803813f508cff2420a)) in zookeeper version 3.6.0+, one test `testGetChildrenOnLargeNumChildren` failed after upgrade. The detailed reason is that zookeeper server shutdown failed because of a too large transaction log entry with the large number of ephemeral children nodes created in the test. This commit changes the children nodes created from ephemeral mode to persistent mode, so it won't cause large transaction log entry, and deletes those children nodes at the end of the test.\r\n5. Change the shutdown() in ZkServer to align the shutdown new behavior with old one.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testLostZkConnection:176 » Helix Workflow testLostZkConne...\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1318, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\nBoth are flaky tests, passed after re-run.\r\n\r\nCI tests:\r\nAll failed tests are known flaky tests, will fix separately\r\nError:  Test failed: testZKHelixManager(org.apache.helix.integration.multizk.TestMultiZkConectionConfig)  Time elapsed: 900.02 s  <<< FAILURE!

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T17:48:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T17:49:37Z","closed_at":"2022-09-26T17:49:37Z","merged_at":"2022-09-26T17:49:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea7076ec8edca5e7bc52c0565e18a7e611852992","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/c38884abbbbfe9af5f8d9ab21f3d23c40b8d0de5","head":{"label":"mgao0:upgrade","ref":"upgrade","sha":"c38884abbbbfe9af5f8d9ab21f3d23c40b8d0de5","user":{"login":"mgao0","id":31704180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzA0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31704180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0","html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233714042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MTQwNDI=","name":"helix","full_name":"mgao0/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgao0","id":31704180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzA0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31704180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0","html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#200 - Link your issue number here: You can write \"Fixes #XXX\". Please use the proper keyword so that the issue gets closed automatically. See https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue\r\nAny of the following keywords can be used: close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd a new interface for zk child listener and refactor to maintain backward compatibility.\r\nThe previous https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/ee61ff434ee37d4ab8456c739b2229f99d9e0e72/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/IZkChildListener.java doesn't pass in `WatchedEvent` to the method, as a result implementation can't depend on different event types.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduce a new interface with the ideal API signature. The old interface is refactored to depend on the new one, AND use a default method for backward compatibility. New use cases should be changed to use `IZkChildEventListener` while there is no breaking change for existing users.\r\nA few other places are changed to allow passing in the event and method signature change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nUpdated `TestZkBasis` and `TestBatchMessage`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

logging error in `ZkClient` delete method to eliminate log noise.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2202#issue-1357887240\r\nReferences an issue where despite a successful retry, failure to remove a node still throws an error log.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2202#issue-1357887240\r\n\r\nRemoved a failed remove log in `ZkClient.delete()`. This log error shows when there is an attempt to delete a parent ZNode with non-empty children. However, it automatically calls another function that recursively deletes the children of the node and in the case this operation is successful, having a stack-trace error from before can confuse users of a problem that is in fact trivial. By deleting the log shown when the above error occurs, we eliminate these misleading logs and avoid log flooding. We can do this as the exception is already being thrown so it is not necessary to log it. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nAdded `testDeleteNodeWithChildren()` in `TestZkBaseDataAccessor.java`\r\n\r\nThe test creates a 10 instance message records. It proceeds to call remove on the parent of those children. The test checks whether remove returns true, which it does. However, the purpose of it is to simulate the initial error that brought upon this change. Going through the debugger, we see that it does go through the right path and effectively does not throw any logs (as it has been removed).\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0,

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nResolves https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2198 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nA few terms used:\r\n1. Source clusters -- the source clusters normally from different data centers that the view aggregator aggregate data from\r\n2. View cluster data -- the aggregated cluster data view from the source clusters\r\n3. Local cache -- the local copy of view cluster data\r\n\r\nThis PR Implements a cache synchronization mechanism to refresh local cache in `ViewClusterRefresher` from view cluster data. This is to provide extra resilience in case of data change externally in view cluster data. If that happens, the previous implementation will lead to eventual data inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe cache is refactored as in `_viewClusterDataCache` to be a snapshot of remote view cluster data, the cache refresh happens at the beginning of each periodic refresh event. A data refresh from source cluster is triggered if a discrepancy is detected between local cache and remote view cluster data (source of truth)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNew test case in `TestHelixViewAggregator` and `TestBasicClusterDataCache`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- maven-bundle-plugin:5.1.4:install (default-install) @ helix-view-aggregator ---\r\n[INFO] Installing org/apache/helix/helix-view-aggregator/1.0.5-SNAPSHOT/helix-view-aggregator-1.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n[INFO] Writing OBR metadata\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix 1.0.5-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Request param validation\r\n2. Cluster has topology aware enabled\r\n3. Number of virtual zones should be less than the number of instances\r\n4. In maintenance mode if configured\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModified `TestVirtualTopologyGroupService` \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2287\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nNOTE: no test or metrics are included in this PR due to PR size. Once reviewed, I will merge this PR into a feature branch instead of master branch, and a subsequent PR will be created for tests and metrics. The test changes here are for test passing only. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes a couple feature changes:\r\n1. Introducing the emergency rebalance process. \r\n2. Move partial rebalance to asynchronous. \r\n3. Add conditions to skip rebalance overwrite. \r\n4. Move cluster model generation to asynchronous global rebalance thread. \r\n5. Changes some API to AssignmentMetadata for operation purposes. For example, the persistX functions no longer include the \"check for same assignment\" logic for early termination. This allows us to a) accurately track write latency and b) tie boolean return values to actual persist failures. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNo test or metrics are included in this PR due to PR size. A subsequent PR will be submitted later. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1318, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 15,419.043 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testP2PStateTransitionEnabled(org.apache.helix.integration.messaging.TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage)  Time elapsed: 31.816 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: There are duplicated transition messages sent at same time! expected:<0> but was:<3>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.messaging.TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled(TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.java:183)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testAggregateMetrics(org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestClusterAggregateMetrics)  Time elapsed: 1.626 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestClusterAggregateMetrics.testAggregateMetrics(TestClusterAggregateMetrics.java:186)\r\n\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:183 There are duplicated transition messages sent at same time! expected:<0> but was:<3>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterAggregateMetrics.testAggregateMetrics:186 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1318, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 208.345 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolve https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2182 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`HelixStateMachineEngine.reset()` is invoked 4 times during participant shutdown and that could take up to a few minutes. Two causes:\r\n\r\n1. The above is triggered by `HelixTaskExecutor` twice because the same HelixStateMachineEngine is registered for two different message types.\r\n2. There is also an additional thread doing similar cleanup, from `ZKHelixManager.cleanupCallbackHandlers`\r\n\r\nThis PR refactor the logic in HelixTaskExecutor to reduce unnecessary method call.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNew test case in helix-core/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/messaging/handling/TestHelixTaskExecutor.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

users to specify reset timeout with system property.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2175\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdd a new system property `TASK_THREADPOOL_RESET_TIMEOUT` so that users can set to specify the timeout limit for reseting the task threadpool.\r\nThe timeout was introduced in https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1920, but users wouldn't be able to set it unless they have access to `DefaultMessagingService`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestDefaultMessagingService.testTaskThreadpoolResetTimeoutProperty\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2175\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe timeout logic introduced in https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1920, failed to provide a client side entry point. As a followup, this PR address the issue by passing down the parameter from HelixManagerFactory down to HelixTaskExecutor so that helix users can specify.\r\nThe parameter is encapsulated in HelixManagerProperty to enable client to specify value and pass down from HelixManagerFactory\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nWe add zkAddr to HelixManagerProperty and parameter validation to resolve param conflicts. Rollback the new constructor in HelixManagerFactory.\r\nValidations in two places:\r\n1. HelixManagerProperty construction, at most one of {zkAddr and ZkConnectionConfig} shall be set. They can both be empty though, a warning is logged but won't block.\r\n2. (Existing logic) ZKHelixManager:validateZkConnectionSettings, if ZkConnectionConfig is set, zkAddress from ZKHelixManager constructor must be null, otherwise early stop.\r\n\r\nWith above two checks, we can ensure: if ZkConnectionConfig is set => the zkAddress must be null, either from HelixManagerProperty or from ZKHelixManager.\r\nWe set higher precedence for zkAddr from HelixManagerProperty, if this is empty, zkAddress passed from constructor is used.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nModified existing test case in [TestParticipantManager.java](https://github.com/apache/helix/compare/master...qqu0127:reset-timeout?expand=1#diff-41a02eec6acda934146e47c98a53813c4af8fd82091db2aadd9f80165af04d17)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2143\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nToday, there is limited code style enforcement in helix-front, leading to unnecessary contributor toil to maintain consistent code style and formatting.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds automatic code formatting for helix-front using https://prettier.io/ and yarn scripts. This PR adds automatic formatting for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and HTML files in the helix-front module.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo new tests, tooling-only PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nThere are no Maven Tests for helix-front.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nNo backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNo Java code changes. This PR adds analogous code formatting for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and HTML files in the helix-front

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2152 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the AclRegister interface, an interface that can be implemented with developers' choices of mechanisms on how ACL is created and registered. The implementation is then registered to the rest server, and it's called when clusters are created. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTestAclRegister\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nRerun failed test in CI:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 62.693 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestMaxNumberOfAttemptsMasterSwitch\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nfix #2150\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the direct dependency on tsickle, which it turns out [is no longer necessary](https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2150#issuecomment-1155973470). \r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the build max warning to 3.47MB which is 3554kb. Finally, this PR  adds the following direct dependencies in order to fix a subsequent [yarn build failure](https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2150#issuecomment-1155975804) that occurred after removing tsickle as a direct dependency: `yarn add ajv-formats && yarn add ajv@7.1.0`.\r\n\r\n<!-- This PR also contains this [small vis-network version bump fix](https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2144/commits/71d53b427b3a018f0bc95aab69854160169275e7) from #2144 so that the CI build for this PR won't fail for that known issue.  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo new tests. Existing tests pass. Let's test removing `tsickle` as a direct dependency:\r\n\r\n- [x] `yarn` successfully installs dependencies\r\n- [x] `yarn type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `yarn lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `yarn build` works\r\n- [x] `yarn start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `yarn test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`yarn start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nfix #2075 #2148\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the end to end tests by replacing the [deprecated Protractor library](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/5502) with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/protractor-to-cypress?cli=true). \r\n\r\nThis PR also replaces karma and jasmine with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/migration-guide) [[Jest + Angular guide](https://dev.to/kiranmantha/integrating-jest-with-latest-angular-version-4h4m)]. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"814\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-07 at 1 37 52 PM\"

issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncypress/e2e/spec.cy.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n[x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module: \r\n\r\nN/A, helix-front only change. No Java changes.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility \r\n\r\n[x] No backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\n### Documentation \r\n\r\n[x] New commands documented in [./helix-front/README.md](./helix-front/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n[x] Commits match Apache style \r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n[x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nN/A, helix-front only change. No Java changes.  See #2143 for an effort to add automatic code formatting for

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #2160 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis commit uses a deprecated class `HelixZkClient.ZkConnectionConfig` to convey the information for non-ZooScalability users in HelixManagerProperty, while ZooScalability users use `RealmAwareZkClient.RealmAwareZkConnectionConfig`. This commit adds some validation around there should be at least one, and only one of `HelixZkClient.ZkConnectionConfig`, `RealmAwareZkClient.RealmAwareZkConnectionConfig`, and zk address exists, and this one field will be used as the source of information to establish connection with ZK server.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdded TestHelixManagerFactory.\r\nAlso ran TestMultiZkHelixJavaApis.java to make sure this commit doesn't break current logic for ZooScalability cases.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-02T22:09:08Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T19:56:01Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T19:56:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80c81af97b0a745c122d577ee77fc4ac9c5c94a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/e9cd97bf52708390c7755869f7aeae6fd986c3cb","head":{"label":"mgao0:managerFactory","ref":"managerFactory","sha":"e9cd97bf52708390c7755869f7aeae6fd986c3cb","user":{"login":"mgao0","id":31704180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzA0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31704180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0","html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233714042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MTQwNDI=","name":"helix","full_name":"mgao0/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgao0","id":31704180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzA0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31704180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0","html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0/helix","description":"Mirror

Issue\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2114 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 13.3.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2113, #2111, #2104, #2094, #2092, #2087, #2083, and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 12.2 to Angular 13.3.\r\n\r\n- [x] `yarn` successfully installs dependencies\r\n- [x] `yarn type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `yarn lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `yarn build` works\r\n- [x] `yarn start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `yarn test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`yarn start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.  The Helix UI renders with 0 errors in the browser console.  \r\n\r\n<img width=\"726\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 12 51 42 AM\"

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2105 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 11.2.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2104, #2094, #2092, #2087, #2083, and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 10.2 to Angular 11.2.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"723\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-23 at 5 44 20 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/169926267-e571984c-a825-4bb6-b340-2d4424644990.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 2 warnings in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"858\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-23 at 5 46 32 PM\"

in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2095 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 10.2.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2094, #2092, #2087, #2083, and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 9.1 to Angular 10.2.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 7 58 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/169172670-e8c37edb-90a9-4ec9-95d4-301712406d00.png)\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 2 warnings in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"740\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-23 at 4 25 54 PM\"

documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2133 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously helix event handling depends on batch enable/disable instance. We would like to move away the dependence on generic batch enable/disable instance and use a dedicated Util only for event handling use case.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThis change only adds PAI signature. Will add test in following PR for API impl.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2092\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 9.1. This PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2092, #2087, #2083,  and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 8.2 to Angular 9.1.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"697\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-13 at 1 32 51 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/168385373-dfcf2eae-ef18-40e6-8af5-5dccaa6e532a.png\">\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 1 warning in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-13 at 2 24 31 PM\"

documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn the recently added TTL feature to ZKClient, some tests are added which rely on `zookeeper.extendedTypesEnabled` system property to be set. This property was set in some of tests, and cleared at the end of the last test in the class that needed it. However, interleaving of test methods from different classes resulted in the property being cleaned by one completed test class while another class has tests that rely on this property still running. This PR ensures the property is set at the beginning of every method that needs it, and cleaned at the end of the method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\ncommand: mvn -pl zookeeper-api test\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 67, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\nFixes #2117\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR makes minor changes to `ClusterStatusMonitor` and `PerInstanceResourceMonitor` to avoid the bottleneck described in #2117.\r\n\r\nNotably:\r\n* Use `computeIfAbsent` instead of multiple `HashMap` methods which duplicate work\r\n* More efficient `hashCode` implementation in `PerInstanceResourceMonitor$BeanName` (avoid calling `toString`)\r\n* More efficient `toString` implementation in `PerInstanceResourceMonitor$BeanName` (`String.format` is expensive)\r\n\r\nAlso removes some code warnings in `PerInstanceResourceMonitor` - remove unnecessary boxing, calls to `toString` etc.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThis does not have any functional impact.","created_at":"2022-05-25T09:01:06Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T00:11:19Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T00:11:19Z","merged_at":"2022-06-02T00:11:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"6524a34a3d79b41d80cc1efa09b6a16d0f3ec31e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/51f2186ad42617e8079bdf708df21e80988ef739","head":{"label":"richardstartin:clusterstatusmonitor-efficiency","ref":"clusterstatusmonitor-efficiency","sha":"51f2186ad42617e8079bdf708df21e80988ef739","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":412015015,"node_id":"R_kgDOGI7Zpw","name":"helix","full_name":"richardstartin/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin/helix","description":"Mirror

Issue\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2114 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 13.3.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2113, #2111, #2104, #2094, #2092, #2087, #2083, and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 12.2 to Angular 13.3.\r\n\r\n- [x] `yarn` successfully installs dependencies\r\n- [x] `yarn type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `yarn lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `yarn build` works\r\n- [x] `yarn start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `yarn test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`yarn start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.  The Helix UI renders with 0 errors in the browser console.  \r\n\r\n<img width=\"726\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 12 51 42 AM\"

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 11.2.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2104, #2094, #2092, #2087, #2083, and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 10.2 to Angular 11.2.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"723\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-23 at 5 44 20 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/169926267-e571984c-a825-4bb6-b340-2d4424644990.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 2 warnings in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"858\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-23 at 5 46 32 PM\"

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2081 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for TTL and Container modes to BaseDataAccessor and its implementations by taking advantage of relevant API from ZkClient and its descendent classes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTwo tests (`testSyncCreateWithTTL()` and `testSyncCreateContainer()`) were added to `TestZkBaseDataAccessor`. In addition, `testAsyncZkBaseDataAccessor()` in the same class was modified to test the newly added API.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2095 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 10.2.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2094, #2092, #2087, #2083, and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 9.1 to Angular 10.2.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-16 at 7 58 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/169172670-e8c37edb-90a9-4ec9-95d4-301712406d00.png)\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 2 warnings in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"740\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-23 at 4 25 54 PM\"

documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2081 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nNew API methods were added to `ZkClient` in #2082 and #2090 to support creation of ZNodes in TTL and Container modes. This PR builds on those API to add this support to `RealmAwareZkClient` and its implementations.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThree new tests are added to `RealmAwareZkClientFactoryTestBase` (which is extended by `TestSharedZkClient` and `TestDedicatedZkClient`) and `TestFederatedZkClient`:\r\n1. `testRealmAwareZkClientCreateContainer()`\r\n2. `testRealmAwareZkClientCreateSequentialWithTTL()`\r\n3. `testRealmAwareZkClientCreateWithTTL()`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix is reading MultiZK config from jvm only when initiating ZkHelixManager. Helix should also read from user passed in connectionConfig.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestMultiZkConectionConfig\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nCI is failing on a constant failing test \"TestClusterAccessor\". The test is fixed in another PR.\r\nTest failed: testGetClusters(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestClusterAccessor) Time elapsed: 0.307 s <<< FAILURE!\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2092\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 9.1. This PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2092, #2087, #2083,  and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 8.2 to Angular 9.1.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"697\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-13 at 1 32 51 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/168385373-dfcf2eae-ef18-40e6-8af5-5dccaa6e532a.png\">\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 1 warning in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-13 at 2 24 31 PM\"

documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2081 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds methods that support creating persistent nodes with Container and TTL modes synchronously to ZkClient and ZkConnection classes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nIn TestRawZkClient, the following tests have been added:\r\n1. testUnimplementedTypes()\r\n2. testCreatePersistentWithTTL()\r\n3. testCreatePersistentSequentialWithTTL()\r\n4. testCreateContainer()\r\n\r\nHowever, these tests verify that node creation happens correctly. They don't test deletion of the TTL and Container nodes by Zookeeper server. These features have been tested locally, but since Zookeeper server makes no guarantee on exactly when the Container and TTL nodes are deleted (see [here](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.9/zookeeperProgrammers.html#TTL+Nodes)), those tests become flaky and as a result, are not added to this PR.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2088\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 8.2. This PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2087, #2083,  and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 7.2 to Angular 8.2.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` runs and passes.\r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"692\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 2 51 54 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/167954001-cdfd3795-2f16-4853-a832-dffb84634386.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 1 warning in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"736\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-11 at 2 53 49 PM\"

documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #2084 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades helix-front to Angular 7.2. This PR completely contains earlier helix-front upgrade PRs #2083 and #2078. These previous Angular major-version PRs should be merged first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nLet's test the upgrade from Angular 6.1 to Angular 7.2:\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm install` works\r\n- [x] `npm run type:check:watch` shows 0 TypeScript errors\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes `All files pass linting.`\r\n- [x] `npm run build` works\r\n- [x] `npm start` works, with 0 errors in the browser console.\r\n- [x] `npm run test` appears to work. \r\n\r\n`npm start` works as expected, and recognizes our proxy config in `proxy.conf.json`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"687\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-10 at 4 16 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119400/167740073-f124219d-497b-49f3-8209-da14817cda6b.png\">\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with XX errors and YY warning in the browser console. The warning is understandable since the piwik telemetry library is not configured. \r\n\r\n`npm run test` results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"750\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-10 at 4 17 10 PM\"

documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not contain new functionality, only tooling and dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\nNot applicable since this PR does not make any changes to the Java

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2081 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds methods that support creating persistent nodes with TTL asynchronously to ZkClient.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe changes have been tested locally, but since Zookeeper server makes no guarantee on exactly when the Container and TTL nodes are deleted (see [here](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.9/zookeeperProgrammers.html#TTL+Nodes)), the tests become flaky and as a result, are not added to this PR.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

runs and passes\r\n- [x] `npm run lint` runs and passes\r\n\r\nHelix UI renders with 0 errors and 1 warning in the browser console. The warning is understandable since I did not specify the optional config necessary for the Piwik analytics library to work.\r\n<img width=\"886\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-02 at 3 58 18 PM\"

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1990\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen an instance is dropped while its history is updated, it's possible the history path is recreated and instance appear in cluster again. \r\nThis PR address this issue by fixing the history update logic. On participant disconnect, we update the path if and only if the node path still exists (not always set). The creation logic stays the same, apparently we still want to have the history node.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNew test in TestParticipantManager\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-28T22:41:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T21:38:41Z","closed_at":"2022-05-03T21:38:41Z","merged_at":"2022-05-03T21:38:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c521dda9ff48f3a6456041d0f0335288e9c8e4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/41bb8b6e527e02d394e2e66cf6c50751dd4c6662","head":{"label":"qqu0127:race-condition-part","ref":"race-condition-part","sha":"41bb8b6e527e02d394e2e66cf6c50751dd4c6662","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1970\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn Apache Pinot, we first deserialize `ZNRecord`s and then construct `HelixProperty`s from them, and never use the `ZNRecord` again. `HelixProperty` makes a defensive copy of the `ZNRecord`, which is actually expensive enough to show up prominently in profiles of our helix threads. This change adds constructors to `HelixConstructor` which do not clone the `ZNRecord`.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2064\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen there is a high level of parallelism configured and the JobDag is a job queue, building the ready job list would take a long time because the loop iterates until the level of parallelism is reached, and doesn't terminate when all the jobs have been processed\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n`TestRuntimeJobDag#testBuildJobQueueWithParallelismExceedingJobCount` was added to verify that the correct job order is still produced. It is not a performance test, but before the fix it took 22 seconds to complete, afterwards it takes ~1ms.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix, no documentation
