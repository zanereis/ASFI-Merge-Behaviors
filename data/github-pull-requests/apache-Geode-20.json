ago we learned that socket operations can hang if there is a true network failure.  The shutdown of peer-to-peer communication sockets was altered to be performed asynchronously in an executor so that, if the Socket.close() operation was blocked, shutdown of the rest of the cache could continue.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends that logic to client/server and WAN communications using the SocketCloser class that is used for peer-to-peer communications.\r\n\r\nSince the blocking problem is in the Java platform itself and only occurs if there is a real network problem it is not possible to write a unit test for the hang observed in this ticket, but I've enhanced SocketCloser to have both before & after Runnables and have added tests for that.\r\n\r\nI've also tried out @Bill's recent enablement of \"@NotNull\" in SocketCloser.  Check it out.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Redis subsystem uses Deltas heavily, but by default deltas do not trigger an update to the size of their buckets. This leads to incorrect memory usage accounting over the long term, especially with the use of Redis commands like \"APPEND\". (See GEODE-8859.)\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set the system property \"DELTAS_RECALCULATE_SIZE\", but this is a global value that would affect the processing of all deltas, including non-Redis operations.\r\n\r\nInstead, this update adds a new default method to the Delta interface, that can be overridden by individual Delta implementations (such as Redis). This triggers the same behavior as DELTAS_RECALCULATE_SIZE, but on a per-delta basis. Thus, other Geode operations will not force bucket size recalculations unless the global property is set, but Redis statistics will be correct (once they are updated to override this new method).","created_at":"2021-01-29T21:46:52Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T17:20:46Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T17:20:46Z","merged_at":"2021-02-23T17:20:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a21c2852746f19755ac302f584ca5b8908eae2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"boglesby","id":1002028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby","html_url":"https://github.com/boglesby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jchen21","id":11181423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgxNDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11181423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/7bdb8d4c1b12d747507b69b8293f1e1a3e495bfc","head":{"label":"ringles:GEODE-8894-Allow-individual-deltas-to-trigger-bucket-size-recalculation","ref":"GEODE-8894-Allow-individual-deltas-to-trigger-bucket-size-recalculation","sha":"7bdb8d4c1b12d747507b69b8293f1e1a3e495bfc","user":{"login":"ringles","id":27864390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODY0Mzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27864390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles","html_url":"https://github.com/ringles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"6d54375a31e2ca7945cf50cfdaee934c00907cee","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravat

PR introduces a new option called `--membership-bind-address` for the `start locator` and `start server` commands.\r\nThere is more information about the use case in the [ticket description](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/GEODE/issues/GEODE-8877).\r\nThe main goal of the code impacts in the code is to use the `membership-bind-address` value in `DirectChannel` & in `GMSHealthMonitor` classes.  \r\n\r\nI also refactored some tests: the changes implemented have impacts in two test cases called `StartLocatorCommandWorkingDirectoryTest` &  `StartServerCommandWorkingDirectoryTest`. These tests were implemented in such a way that any new parameter introduced in `start locator` and `start server` commands were impacting them. But they were implemented just to verify the working directory resolution, so I extracted that code to a new method called `resolveWorkingDirectory()`, simplyfing the tests and moving them to `StartLocatorCommandTest` & `StartServerCommandTest`.

of the use case:\r\nWhen deploying geode, for locator we define hostname-for-clients.

This change is intended to address an issue with port bind conflicts\r\n  specifically when VMs are restarted. Thus this change only specifies a\r\n  specific port when bouncing a VM. In this case we use a RMI port\r\n  outside the usual range of ephemeral ports for MacOS (49152–65535) and\r\n  Linux (32768-60999).\r\n- We typically try and use ephemeral ports everywhere. However,\r\n  sometimes an ephemeral port created during a prior start needs to be\r\n  used as a fixed port on subsequent bounces. In this case, ephemeral\r\n  ports that are allocated early may end up conflicting with these fixed\r\n  ports.\r\n- Remove various unused methods related to bounce()ing VMs.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
