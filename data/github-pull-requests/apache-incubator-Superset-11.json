building `superset-node` in development's Docker Compose file [doesn't use image baked with `zstd`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L151-L152). This PR fixes the issue by using zstd-baked image from existing Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore\r\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f2bc13-6ec3-4b12-ae9b-09aac540c74c\">\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n<img width=\"1029\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7049017-409b-4983-a3aa-b1be2605bcb6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nOn my local devenv today I ran into the issue described in #27896. I'm not sure why I hadn't run into this previously, but I believe it's because I had done a downgrade past this revision at some point, potentially triggering the erroneous perm state caused by the missing pvm in `NEW_PVMS`.

#30259\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe action DASHBOARD_INFO_UPDATED changes the `first_name` and `last_name` properties of the owner to a `full_name` property [[#17570](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17570/files#diff-bbab1592904855ed63c204cedb8c14efc9eed397dac25756ac32f1cca4843518R206-R211)].\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-13 at 1 53 01 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8a91290-f667-44f3-9bc1-d4401aa22a7b)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the display change logic for the `full_name` property is only applied in the property modal, resulting in an error where other code referencing the owner outputs `undefined`.\r\nTo resolve this issue, the same Owner type and display getter function have been applied in the affected code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

#30260\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn the [#28192](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28192/files#diff-fe59770000288da9bca75381ca9b5d44d076cba76c37a653881a12763ecbf96eL192), the CSV menu was changed from a page URL to a modal popup, which led to an issue where the popup could be triggered even when the menu was in a disabled state.\r\nThis commit addresses the problem by passing the disabled property to the menu, making it impossible to click.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a configurable context manager that wraps the `create_engine` call to analytical databases. The intended use case is to configure the Oracle driver with tenant-specific settings in a multi-tenant environment, but there are many other potential use cases for this:\r\n\r\n1. Custom logging\r\n2. Supressing noisy logs from 3rd party database drivers\r\n3. `chroot`ing to prevent 3rd party databases drivers from accessing the filesystem (maybe using [pychroot](https://pypi.org/project/pychroot/))\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nMove the `SQLScript`, `SQLStatement`, and related functions that use `sqlglot` to a new directory `superset/sql/`, since the `superset/sql_parse.py` file is getting big. This was suggested by @mistercrunch on the discussion about SIP-117.\r\n\r\nThe goal with SIP-117 is to have all SQL parsing living in `superset/sql/` and using `sqlglot`, and get rid of `sql_parse.py`.\r\n\r\nI also split the unit tests from `tests/unit_tests/sql_parse_tests.py` to `tests/unit_tests/sql/parse_tests.py`, and in the process I converted some of the old `ParsedQuery.tables` tests to the new `extract_tables_from_statement` function.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nUsers sometimes don't understand the field with the ambiguous name \"Sort By\".  For instance, in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30238 someone expected it would govern the order of the bars along the axis.  Other times they think it will sort the order of series on a dimension field.  These two kinds of sorting have more clearly-named fields; this \"Sort By\" sorts the underlying data which is relevant only in the case where a row limit or series limit is reached.\r\n\r\nThis PR renames that field from \"Sort By\" to \"Data Limit Sort By\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

accounts for the issue reported on #30061. However, more work is required so that when a scope is applied the frontend can check columns / calculated columns across different datasets to see whether the query should be sent over the backend at all. Working on a follow-up PRs that should solve the issue for both native and cross filters.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b91a4a8-2c14-4bfb-84f4-94d82d02ec84\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a85fc52-2c13-4cf4-977f-f9623c0a55f3\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR makes two changes to enable the setting of `method = 'multi'` when the Pandas function `.to_sql` is called to write a file upload to a data warehouse.  This speeds up file uploads by 15x.  See discussion https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/30152 for background and discussion.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n1. The base method `df_to_sql` does not currently access the `supports_multivalues_insert` attribute when it is set in a Superset EngineSpec.  Instead it relies on this attribute being set in the SQLAlchemy implementation for that dialect.  After this PR, Superset will check both of these places for the attribute.\r\n2. Sets the attribute `supports_multivalues_insert` to `True` for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), which has supported this behavior since SQL Server 2008.\r\n\r\nThanks to @nytai for advising.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck that uploading a flat file to a data warehouse succeeds.  I tested it for MSSQL.  This PR was written to not reduce any existing functionality (there's an `or` with the previous condition) but someone could check on another data warehouse too.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nWhen downloading the dashboard as a screenshot/PDF via the client, a `POST` request is sent to `/api/v1/dashboard/cache_dashboard_screenshot/`, and then a following  `GET` request has to be sent to `/api/v1/dashboard/${dashboardId}/screenshot/${cacheKey}/?download_format=${format}`. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `GET` request to be fired with `SupersetClient` as opposed to `fetch`, to make sure that the `GUEST_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME` header is included in the request (for guest users).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Access a dashboard via embedded.\r\n2. Download the dashboard as PDF.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade

Modules also couldn't be published with changelogs because the changelogs were too big, and lerna.json files weren't passing linting. This PR includes all the changes needed to get a module release out the door.\r\n\r\nThis does a bunch of random stuff:\r\n• Builds plugins and packages in PROD mode rather than DEV mode\r\n• Fixes up a bunch of typescript issues that cropped up in dev mode\r\n• Fixes a bunch of dependency and import issues that were caught by TS and ESlint\r\n• Updates build and publication scripts to work as expected. They should also have more obvious tag names going forward.\r\n• Adds lerna-generated changelogs, which _should_ now include ASF license boilerplate going forward\r\n• All kinds of little corrections/overrides/nudges to get things to build and pass correctly.\r\n\r\nNew versions of packages have been built mid-flight. When this is merged, I'll bump them again and dial in any automation as needed in a subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nFixes #30058\r\n\r\nThe EChart tooltip is hidden using `visibility: hidden` with `opacity: 0` after it disappears, which causes tooltips generated from the previous tab to be recognized as scroll items when configuring the layout for the next tab, resulting in unnecessary scrollbars.\r\n\r\n> display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom). There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags.\r\n>\r\n> visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. The tag is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses the issue by using a CSS hack to change the visibility hidden tooltip to `display: none`, effectively removing it and resolving the scrollbar problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/315ac940-47dc-4c0d-b55b-4b16e2237195\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8e3d1f-e4bb-4022-8982-63229293576f\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create a dashboard with 2 inner tabs\r\n2. In one tab, add a bunch of charts so that it needs scrolling\r\n3. In the other tab, add a few charts so it does not need scrolling\r\n4. Create a native filter\r\n5. Scroll to the bottom on the first tab and **mouse over a chart to show a tooltip**\r\n6. Select the second tab\r\n7. Check that the dashboard height is not calculated correctly and presents a scroll\r\n8. Scroll to the bottom and see the native filters panel break\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nPart of the work on [SIP-117](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26786), this PR introduces a `has_mutation()` method to `SQLScript`, as well as a `is_mutating()` method to `SQLStatement`, in order to check if the SQL contains any DML.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a bug where this SQL is flagged incorrectly as DML:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nwith source as (\r\n  select 1 as one\r\n)\r\nselect * from source\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nCross filtering feature is designed to apply filters based on a dimension that user clicked in the source chart.\r\nIn some chart plugins, when the chart has no dimensions (only metric series), click on a metric would emit an empty cross filter, providing confusing user experience.\r\nThis PR disables cross filtering on charts that have no dimensions set.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some charts were marked as compatible with cross filtering feature (`behaviors: [Behavior.InteractiveChart]`), but were in fact not implementing the feature. In those charts I removed the behavior and added a `TODO` comment to implement cross filtering.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to \"Featured Charts\" dashboard.\r\n2. Verify that charts with dimensions (e.g. Area, Box Plot, Gauge, Pie) still emit cross filters as before\r\n3. Verify that charts with no dimensions (e.g. Mixed) do not emit cross filters - nothing happens on click, cross filtering option in context menu is disabled\r\n4. Add more charts with no dimensions to the dashboard, verify that they don't emit cross filters after clicking on a metric series.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

had the virtuous intent to align mysql and postgres to a consistent isolation_level (READ COMMITTED), which seems fitted for Superset. Though instead of doing this, and because sqlite doesn't support that specific one, it set the default to SERIALIZABLE which seems to exist by many engines.\r\n\r\nNow SERIALIZABLE can create issues like this one: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30064 and upping the isolation level can have serious load implications for large deployments (or databases that are fitted \"just-right\" for their loads, like someone may use a tiny RDS for Superset)\r\n\r\nHere I'm realizing we need dynamic defaults for isolation_level based on which engine is in used, which can't be done in config.py as we don't know yet what engine will be set by the admin at that time. So I thought the superset/initialization package might be the right place for this.\r\n\r\nOpen to other solutions, but I think this one works.\r\n\r\n## alternative considered\r\n* using

SUMMARY\r\nSince `destroyInactiveTabPane` is disabled for improving rendering perf on switching tabs in [#26791](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26791/files#diff-f62a410d38c860c568090a5f5c0f0a3e2a3f621162ec665fa35ce17977cc34b0L284), I have confirmed that the Ace Editor was monitoring and responding to events even on inactive tabs.\r\nAs a result, race conditions related to the cursor position were occurring when switching between tabs. This commit addresses these issues by modifying the behavior so that, similar to `destroyInactiveTabPane`, the Ace Editor component is excluded when a tab becomes inactive.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n#30141 resolved the initial SQLLab page loading issue, but I identified that the same race condition error occurs when the cursor moves.\r\nThe problem is that the cursorPosition should only be accessed during onLoad to set the initial cursor position, but an issue arises where the Ace Editor is re-rendered whenever the cursorPosition is changed via useQueryEditor selector. During rerendering, the Ace Editor keeps resetting the cursor position, triggering the cursorUpdate event, which in turn causes onCursorPositionChange to be called repeatedly, leading to an infinite cursor position update loop.\r\nTo resolve this, avoided accessing the cursor position in real-time from the unsaved state and limited access to the initial state only, thereby preventing the number of re-renders.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nSpecs are added\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the `from_dttm` and `to_dttm` Jinja variables make it possible to reference the time range endpoints from within the Jinja context. However, they have some shortcomings:\r\n- `to_dttm` always points to the current day, even if there's no time range present in the query (this appears to be a quirk of how the `get_since_until` helper function works).\r\n- They are always formatted using the `.isoformat()` method. This means that it's difficult to use them for database-specific formatting that's readily available in `BaseEngineSpec.convert_dttm`.\r\n- It's impossible to access a specific time filter if there are multiple time filters present.\r\n- In the case of virtual datasets, it's not possible to remove the time filter from the outer query (this is possible for regular filter types using the `filter_value` and `get_filters` macros).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new Jinja macro called `get_time_filter`, which returns a dataclass with the following properties:\r\n- `from_expr`: The SQL expression representing the start of the time range, if available\r\n- `to_expr`: The SQL expression representing the end of the time range, if available\r\n- `time_range`: The (usually) human readable raw value of the time filter (e.g. \"No filter\", \"Last week\" etc)\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the added docs for how the feature works in practice:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9a3be68-b69b-4ebd-859d-8ea65502b342)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8be53b25-7010-4184-8f7e-7cd7a366c55a)\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nIn certain cases, a race condition was observed where the cursor position in the Redux state and the cursor position in the ACE editor would repeatedly update each other.\r\nThis commit

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28702 unified JSON calls to a single module which is great. Unfortunately, that PR also altered the default behavior when loading a JSON object and added a log entry every time an invalid object is parsed to the utility function. It is the responsibility of the caller to decide how to deal with an invalid JSON. In many places, a default empty object is used when an invalid JSON is received and there's no need for extra logs. This PR restores the previous behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30079\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck the original issue for instructions.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIntroduces changes in the front and backend to allow Superset to be deployed under a prefixed-URL path rather than the root of the domain.\r\n\r\nThe backend `superset.app:create_app` has been augemented with a new `app_root` argument that accepts a root path for the application. This is passed through the `FLASK_APP` environment variable or the `flask --app` cli argument. When the path is not `/` a middleware is created that intercepts paths and updates them to strip the `app_root` and forward them to the rest of the application. This was inspired by [Application Dispatching](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/appdispatch/).\r\n\r\nThe backend has also been refactored to avoid using hardcoded paths in redirects and instead uses `Flask.url_for` to construct all references. \r\n\r\nThe frontend has been updated to include the prefix in any resource links along with two new helper utilities, `assetUrl` & `pathUtils`, to help construct the paths. The `SupersetClient` has been updated to remove the unused `baseUrl` field and rename it as `basePath` such that the object can be initialized with the base path and calling any endpoints through this class can use the same relative link as before. QUESTION: Have I broken an API here?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been added to the \"Configuring Superset\" pages that demonstrate how to use the new argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nMore work on Snowflake OAuth2 (this PR depends on #30082). This PR introduces a new field for the database configuration modal, allowing OAuth2 client information to be provided by the user:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"501\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-02 at 8 57 34 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd53c3a-0c9f-4a3f-b80c-3f0f161f14b0\">\r\n\r\nThe component combines the 5 different input fields, and then passes them inside the `masked_encrypted_extra` attribute on database CRUD:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"oauth2_client_info\": {\r\n    \"id\": \"123456\",\r\n    \"secret\": \"XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\r\n    \"authorization_request_uri\": \"https://account.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/authorize\",\r\n    \"token_request_uri\": \"https://account.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/token-request\",\r\n    \"scope\": \"refresh_token session:role:USERADMIN\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note that ideally we would pass these in the `parameters` field, and let the DB engine spec build the object in `encrypted_extra`. But the `build_sqlalchemy_uri` method — as the name suggests — only builds an URI, so we would have to modify it to return a tuple with `(uri, connect_args)` if we passed them client information inside `parameters`, and also figure out a way to inform that these fields should be stored in `encrypted_extra`, not `extra`, so for now the frontend does the work. I left a small TODO for me to fix this in the future.)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases\">reselect's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.1.1</h2>\n<p>This <strong>patch release</strong> fixes behavior of <code>resultEqualityCheck</code> in <code>weakMapMemoize</code>, fixes the case of <code>lruMemoize</code> being given a <code>maxSize</code> less than 1, and tweaks the internal implementation of <code>lruMemoize</code>.  (We've also updated our general build tooling.)</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<p>Previously, providing the <code>resultEqualityCheck</code> option to <code>weakMapMemoize</code> resulted in it being called with empty objects as part of the initialization / dev check process. That could be an issue if your comparison function expected different values.

(2022-05-14)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Changed: This is now an [ESM only package]. (I haven’t written that gist, but it’s a great resource.)</p>\n<p>If you need CommonJS, install version 3.0.0.
