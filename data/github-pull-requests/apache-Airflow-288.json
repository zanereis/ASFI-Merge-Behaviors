In your `airflow.cfg` file, under `[webserver]`, set `rbac = True`.  \r\n5. Run `airflow initdb` to generate new tables for RBAC support.\r\n6. Run `airflow create_admin` to create an admin user.\r\n7. Run `airflow webserver` as usual.\r\n\r\nNote that the default auth type is DB.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [*] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Mesos Executor should allow specifying optional Docker image before running airflow command\r\n\r\nIn its current form, MesosExecutor schedules tasks on mesos slaves which just contain airflow

This assumption goes against the Mesos philosophy of having a heterogeneous cluster.\r\n\r\nSince Mesos provides an option to pull a docker image before actually running the actual task/command so this improvement changes the mesos_executor.py to specify an optional docker image containing airflow which can be pulled on slaves before running the actual airflow

writing a plugin that was trying to access the built-in Variable store, the documentation here led me to believe I could access it with `var.name_of_my_variable`. I've added some further documentation here that informs developers of the more specific calls which are referenced here: https://airflow.apache.org/code.html#default-variables\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2053\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nModified the condition to check if the quote_character is set. This will allow setting `quote_character` as an empty string when the data doesn't contain quoted sections.\r\n\r\nThe BigQuery API states [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs#configuration.load.quote) that :\r\n\r\n> The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ('\"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.\r\n\r\nBut the current implementation `run_load ` in BigQuery hook has incorrect check to include `quote_character`.\r\n\r\nThe code currently is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if 'fieldDelimiter' not in src_fmt_configs:\r\n            src_fmt_configs['fieldDelimiter'] = field_delimiter\r\n        if quote_character:\r\n            src_fmt_configs['quote'] = quote_character\r\n        if allow_quoted_newlines:\r\n            src_fmt_configs['allowQuotedNewlines'] = allow_quoted_newlines\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf my data doesn't have quote characters as per BQ API docs I need to put `quote=''` i.e empty string. The above condition `if quote_character:` will return false for an empty string. Hence, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{'message': 'Error detected while parsing row starting at position: 0. Error: Data between close double quote (\") and field separator.', 'reason': 'invalid'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSingle line modification\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T21:06:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T01:12:37Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T08:32:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d0d68c808bb3305eb97e63423a214ae13104113","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2996/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2996/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2996/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d68cc663ff7884351ce13286711fb33231fff2b8","head":{"label":"kaxil:bq_hook_quote_fix","ref":"bq_hook_quote_fix","sha":"d68cc663ff7884351ce13286711fb33231fff2b8","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

This PR is a simple fix for that bug. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2027\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe scheduler loop sleeps for 1 second every loop unnecessarily. Remove this sleep to slightly speed up scheduling, and instead do it once all files have been parsed. It can add up since it runs to every scheduler loop which runs # of dags to parse/scheduler parallelism times. We have seen it increase scheduling times by 10% in our production environment.\r\n\r\nAlso remove the unnecessary increased file processing interval in tests which slows them down.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCan't test this very well since it is a sleep interval, might mock out the sleep and test the calculated of sleep_length though. It has been running on the Airbnb Airflow cluster for many weeks now.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n@saguziel

title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2042\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFixes a small but annoying issue in Safari, in which typing in search bar makes both the browser default and bootstrap typeahead menus to appear. To prevent it, we set autocomplete to \"off\" on input elements.\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n\r\n![issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62379/35524278-0507249a-0519-11e8-92e5-d627d575a1a0.png)\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62379/35524282-091275a8-0519-11e8-8cb4-ea3206f3754f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis is a tiny UI change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1623\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFixing a previous TODO item to also kill the root process whenever the process tree is being killed. By sending a SIGTERM signal to the root process (`airflow run --raw ...`), the signal handler will catch the signal and complete necessary cleanups (i.e. operator on_kill).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Unit test\r\n- Run Airflow locally with LocalExecutor. Cleared a running task from the UI and verified that operator's on_kill method is triggered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n@milanvdmria  @ashb \r\nI think this approach is simpler (that @ashb suggested in #2877). I've tested it with LocalExecutor and it behaves as expected, so it should at least fix some issues folks have been experiencing.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1874\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Adds a `use_legacy_sql` parameter to the BigQueryHook constructor. This parameter determines whether queries executed via this hook will be issued using `legacy` or `standard` dialect by default. To maintain compatibility, this can still be overridden at the cursor level, and in the `get_pandas_df` method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Adds `TestBigQueryHookLegacySql`, which tests that this parameter is threaded through from hook instantiation down to the underlying cursor. No regressions on existing `BigQueryHook` tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-22T01:52:41Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T19:34:55Z","closed_at":"2018-01-22T17:28:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9398033af979dfcfa742505e57e1a8158ee7c984","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2964/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2964/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2964/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d5d2c01f37f345458d9eeb8cdfbb0e77b55eb7ea","head":{"label":"ji-han:master","ref":"master","sha":"d5d2c01f37f345458d9eeb8cdfbb0e77b55eb7ea","user":{"login":"ji-han","id":8248947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDg5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8248947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han","html_url":"https://github.com/ji-han","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118188805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgxODg4MDU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"ji-han/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ji-han","id":8248947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNDg5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8248947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han","html_url":"https://github.com/ji-han","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ji-han/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ji-han/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 2017](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2017/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-2017] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2017\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently we're not getting the output logs of the postgres operator that you would get otherwise if you ran a psql command. It's because the postgres conn has an attribute called [notices](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.notices) which contains this information.\r\nWe need to just print the results of this to get that output in the airflow logs, which makes it easy to debug amongst other things.\r\n\r\nI've included some images for before and after pictures.\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n<img width=\"1146\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-19 at 4 46 59 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10408007/35178405-6f6a1da8-fd3d-11e7-8f50-0dbd567d8ab4.png\">\r\n**AFTER**\r\n<img width=\"1147\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-19 at 4 46 25 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10408007/35178406-74ea4ae6-fd3d-11e7-9551-631eac6bfe7b.png\">\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThere isn't anything to test, there is nothing changing to the current implementation besides an addition of logging.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-20T01:24:59Z","updated_at":"2018-01-20T22:32:55Z","closed_at":"2018-01-20T09:06:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e70db4ded1dfa33d8e8d71b426ce0191cc10a859","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/385eb95a0cdc6e91135a261ca6c2876f16011333","head":{"label":"Acehaidrey:AIRFLOW-2017","ref":"AIRFLOW-2017","sha":"385eb95a0cdc6e91135a261ca6c2876f16011333","user":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94568127,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDU2ODEyNw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Acehaidrey/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

This change only addresses the set_task_instance_state\r\nuse case.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2014\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nHere is a sample URL parameter that will cause the sqlalchemy row not found error:\r\n`rowid=validate_something%2Cparent..my-sub-DAG%2C2018-01-18+03%3A00%3A00`. Other details above and in the JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] There are no existing unit tests of www/views.py `set_task_instance_state`. While desirable to have those tests, it seems beyond the scope of this bug fix to create them from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

task generation performance significantly by using sets of\r\ntask_ids and dag_ids instead of lists when calculating total priority\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-192\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n        weighting method used for the effective total           \r\n        priority weight of the task. Options are:                               \r\n        ``{ downstream | upstream | absolute }`` default is ``downstream``      \r\n        When set to ``downstream`` the effective weight of the task is the      \r\n        aggregate sum of all downstream descendants. As a result, upstream      \r\n        tasks will have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively   \r\n        when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have         \r\n        multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to     \r\n        complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing           \r\n        downstream tasks. When set to ``upstream`` the effective weight is the  \r\n        aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where     \r\n        downtream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more           \r\n        aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you \r\n        have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete    \r\n        before starting upstream tasks of other dags.  When set to              \r\n        ``absolute``, the effective weight is the exact ``priority_weight``     \r\n        specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when    \r\n        you know exactly what priority weight each task should have.            \r\n        Additionally, when set to ``absolute``, there is bonus effect of        \r\n        significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large   \r\n        DAGS. Options can be set as string or using the constants defined in    \r\n        the static class ``airflow.utils.WeightRule``\r\n \r\nAdditionally, the performance of the priority weight is significantly improved by switching over to a set instead of iterating through a list to test for membership.\r\n\r\nFor this dag on my computer:\r\n[2.5k parallel operators] -> [join operator] -> [2.5k parallel operators] -> [join operator] -> [2.5k parallel operators] \r\n\r\n| Implementation | Time to \"Examine DAG run\" |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| Original | 10 minutes |\r\n| New | 60 seconds |\r\n| `absolute` weight | 1 second |\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_dag_task_priority_weight_total\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1995](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1995/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1995] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1995\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe sqoop operator behind the scenes sets off a bash command, but one bug arises due to the fact that the on kill method is not implemented. It needs to be implemented in order to kill the process for a sqoop task, otherwise weird things happen trying to end the task.\r\n\r\nCC @Fokko \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDifficult to get a test for. Tested locally by making sure the pid is killed as soon as method is called locally but without binary it fails. I use same on kill method as bash operator\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 511](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-511/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-511] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-511\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently when a dagrun timeout happens there is not an alert sent off on a task failure callback because the way it works is that a timeout just prevents downstream tasks from getting scheduled and it allows the task currently running to finish out. There is not much insight that the dag actually stopped which should definitely be caught. \r\nAlso there are certain callbacks you may want once the entire dag has completed successfully as well, making sense to have both callbacks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests the callbacks for on success, on failure, and also checks that a dagrun timeout also triggers the callback.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1974\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI've refactored the DatabricksHook and DatabricksOperator classes in order to ease the development of new DatabricksOperators that handle other endpoints than ``2.0/jobs/runs/submit``.\r\n\r\nTo do so, I've created a DatabricksOperator \"base class\" and refactored the previous DatabricksSubmitRunOperator class to inherit the first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe previous tests for DatabricksHook and DatabricksSubmitRunOperator classes were updated to be in compliance with some small changes make the respective classes. DatabricksOperator class is tested through DatabricksSubmitRunOperator child class.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-11T19:01:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-05T06:01:50Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T23:52:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b90f37fbd61c341e529d9f4cc5b93c7b7fde317","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1982\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI was receiving emails like:\r\n```\r\nException:\r\nExecutor reports task instance %s finished (%s) although the task says its %s. Was the task killed externally?\r\n```\r\nEg the template formatting wasn't working.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n3 character find/replace hopefully doesn't require a test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn PR2532 (AIRFLOW-1520), the AWS credential code was refactored into a general\r\n AWS hook.  When that change was made, the existing assume role code was\r\n removed, leaving only ID/Secret credentials as an option.  Our dags rely on\r\n role assumption to access external S3 buckets, so this code re-adds role\r\n assumption via STS.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in order to make this a bit easier, I changed _get_credentials to\r\n return a functioning boto3 session which is used by the public methods to\r\n initialize clients/resources/whatever.  This seemed a better route than\r\n adding another returnval in an already long list.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8
