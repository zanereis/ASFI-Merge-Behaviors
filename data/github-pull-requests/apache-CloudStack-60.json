processes on the VRs log to cloud.log. When log rotate kicks in, the file is rotated but the scripts still write to the old inode (cloud.log.1 after rotate). Tis quickly fills up the tiny log partition.\n\nUsing 'copytruncate' is a small tradeoff, there is a slight change of missing a log entry, but in the old situation nothing ended up in cloud.log after rotate (except for stuff that was (re)started) so I think this is the best solution until we properly rewrite the script to either use their own script or syslog.\n\nMore details:

general route for RFC 1918 space, as otherwise it will be sent to the public gateway and likely to be dropped (internet providers do not route ip space that is meant for internal use). More specific routes that may be set have preference over this generic routes so this works even with private ranges used for public ip space (as shown below).\n\nWhen using an internal DNS server some hosts may resolve to an RFC 1918 ip address. The SSVM has a default gw to public so if it has no route for this ip address space, it will not work. This PR makes generic RFC 1918 (so all internal ip adresses like 10.0.0.10 etc) to the local management gateway. This makes them reachable. Without this fix, it is sent upstream and it is dropped there.\n\nShould there be a more generic route (smaller prefix), this has preference over the generic routes.\n\nExample in my dev environment:\n\n```\nroot@v-1-VM:~# route -n\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.23.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth2\n10.0.0.0        192.168.22.1    255.0.0.0       UG    0      0        0 eth1\n169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 eth0\n172.16.0.0      192.168.22.1    255.240.0.0     UG    0      0        0 eth1\n192.168.0.0     192.168.22.1    255.255.0.0     UG    0      0        0 eth1\n192.168.22.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1\n192.168.23.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth2\n```\n\nRoute `192.168.0.0/16` goes via `eth1` but `192.168.23.0/24` is more specific and has preference and goes via `eth2`. It works:\n\n```\nroot@v-1-VM:~# ping 8.8.8.8\nPING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 48 data bytes\n56 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=49 time=7.179 ms\n^C--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---\n1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 7.179/7.179/7.179/0.000 ms\n```\n\nThis solves a lot of the 'internal resolving' issues we face.\n\nWhen the public ip address is RFC1918 itself, we do not set the

PR contains the same fixes from PR #1179, which was created against the master branch.\n\nIn addition, the points mentioned by @DaanHoogland were handled in this new PR:\n- Made the code more consistent\n  - result = result && methodCall(), instead of throwing exceptions in some places or not checking 2 consecutive returns - in case of rVPC.\n- Added an unit test to cover changes in the VpcRouterElementImpl.applyVpnUsers() method. The method returns an array of String, so I had to make sure it would contain the users from 2 consecutive calls. There are 2 tests to cover negative

deployVM thread is holding the global lock on network longer and cause delays and some improvements in the planner\n\nThere are some VM deployment failures happening when multiple VMs are deployed at a time, failures mainly due to NetworkModel code that iterates over all the vlans in the pod. This causes each deployVM thread to hold the global lock on Network longer and cause delays. This delay in turn causes more threads to choose same host and fail since capacity is not available on that host.\n\nFollowing are some changes required to be done to reduce delays during VM deployments which in turn causes some vm deployment failures when multiple VMs are launched at a time.\n-  In Planner, remove the clusters that do not contain a host with matching service offering tag.

NSX api client relies on a sequence of responses to identify the need to authenticate and to follow redirects. In order to avoid live-locks, the NSX API client has a counter that will abort the execution after 5 consecutive requests that do not produce a Success (200) response.\nWhen a NSX controller enters a faulty state it can allow authentication requests but deny any other API call. In such cases the NSX API client will consider the denied request a reason to follow a redirect and will enter into a live-lock (because the actual redirection is not happening).\nThis PR changes the NSX API client to no reset it's counter on a Success response from an authentication request. That is, the counter is only reset if another type of API call yields a Success response.\n\nIn addition, this PR also:\n- changes the configuration of the license-maven-plugin to ignore files generated by pmd\n- moves the NSX marvin test to a plugins folder\n- refactors the NSX marvin test to reduce duplication\n- adds an extra test case to the NSX marvin test that checks that NSX tunnels are properly created\n","created_at":"2015-12-05T17:01:57Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T18:35:30Z","closed_at":"2015-12-07T18:35:30Z","merged_at":"2015-12-07T18:35:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"2aa708cdc5b838554824d8520e3a689dd93723cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/811f254e4ddcc8de0bc0375f35783eea4e04ef6d","head":{"label":"miguelaferreira:nsx-livelock","ref":"nsx-livelock","sha":"811f254e4ddcc8de0bc0375f35783eea4e04ef6d","user":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40481513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDQ4MTUxMw==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"miguelaferreira/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miguelaferreira","id":4670993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguelaferreira/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miguelaferreira/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

need to send an Unsolicited ARP to the gateway, instead of our own address. We now encounter problems when people deploy/destroy/deploy and get the same public ip.\n\nPackets arrive, but with incorrect / cached mac and are ignored by the routervm kernel.\nRun arping manually to update the arp-cache on the gateway and things start to work.\n\nThen we discovered the `arping` is actually done, but sent to its own address. Therefore the gateway doesn't pick it up. We only saw this happening when rapid deploy tools are used, like Terraform that do deploy/destroy/deploy and might get the same ip but on a new router having a new mac.\n\n```\n2015-12-03 18:07:25,589  CsHelper.py execute:160 Executing: arping -c 1 -I eth1 -A -U -s 192.168.23.8 192.168.23.1\n```\n\nThe integration tests seem happy, although the full run is still ongoing:\n\n```\n=== TestName: test_01_create_redundant_VPC_2tiers_4VMs_4IPs_4PF_ACL | Status : SUCCESS ===\n```\n\nThanks @sspans for helping trouble shoot this.

adds an option to the cloud-setup-management script to not start the management server after a successful configuration of it. \n\nThe primary motivation for this is to avoid circular dependency issues on systems that use systemd. When calling cloud-setup-management from a unit with a Before= directive on a service depending on\ncloudstack-management, the process will deadlock because /usr/bin/service will delegate to systemd, which is waiting for the Before service to start.\n\nExecuting the cloud-setup-management script with this new `--no-start` option will simply leave the management server stopped after a successful configuration. systemd can then be bypassed with `export _SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_REDIRECT=1` and using the init.d

PR fixes the issue we faced with Private Gateways on single VPC when using ACS 4.6.0 and onwards.\n\nThe root cause: during the VR refactor, the static routes configuration was left unimplemented.\n\nThis PR also improves the existing Replace ACL test and adds a new test, that cover the Private Gateway in a more complete way.\n\nThe new test does the following:\n1. Create 2 VPCs\n2. Create 2 Tiers - 1 per VPC\n3. Deploy 2 VMs - 1 per Tier\n4. Acquire 2 pub IPs - 1 per VPC\n5. Create 2 PF rules - 1 per pub IP\n6. Create 2 ACLs + rules - 1 per VPC\n7. Assign new ACLs to Tiers\n8. Create 2 Private GWs - 1 per VPC\n9. Replace the Pvt GWs ACLs\n10. Create 2 Static routes - 1 per Pvt GW\n11. SSH into VM1 (VPC1) and from there ping VM2 (VPC2)\n\nThere is also a test for Private Gateways on Redundant VPCs. But I found out that the feature is broken in when used with rVPCs. It will be addressed in a separate Issue/PR.\n\nI'm running the tests. Will post results as soon as they are
