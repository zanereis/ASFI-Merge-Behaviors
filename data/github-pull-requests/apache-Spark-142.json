What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the histogram_numeric SQL function to support more numeric input types, returning the results an an array of structs of two fields each. The first field has the same type as the first argument to the histogram_numeric aggregate function (rather than always having double type before this change). This removes the need for the user to apply a cast function to the result in order to use it.\r\n\r\nExample behavior after this change becomes effective:\r\n\r\nSELECT histogram_numeric(col, 3) FROM VALUES (TIMESTAMP '2017-03-01 00:00:00'),\r\n(TIMESTAMP '2017-04-01 00:00:00'), (TIMESTAMP '2017-05-01 00:00:00') AS tab(col);\r\n\r\nReturns type: struct<histogram_numeric(col,

changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis removes the need for users to explicitly cast the function result type in many cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the `histogram_numeric` function result type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests, file-based query tests.","created_at":"2022-03-04T18:37:25Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T06:26:51Z","closed_at":"2022-03-14T06:26:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c08b02743ad6311bc6e927c14e93c00e8f83fbf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35735/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35735/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35735/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/39833e93cd9d33e8eea1864c1c61cdf32e5d2e50","head":{"label":"dtenedor:numeric-histogram-types","ref":"numeric-histogram-types","sha":"39833e93cd9d33e8eea1864c1c61cdf32e5d2e50","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"14cda58a477042ef912af3b63261bcbf7d8b059a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

As follows example, analyze the table size will be 100 instead of 19999, which affects the join optimization, and it will attempt to deliver a large table broadcast if `manifest` file size is less than `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`, and after this PR, analyze the table size will be 19999\r\n\r\n\r\nwe have files:\r\n```\r\nsize   filepath\r\n100    hdfs:///path/to/table/manifest\r\n9999   hdfs:///path/to/other/part-1.parquet.orc\r\n10000  hdfs:///path/to/other/part-2.parquet.orc\r\n```\r\n\r\ncontent of `hdfs:///path/to/table/manifest` :\r\n```\r\nhdfs:///path/to/other/part-1.parquet.orc\r\nhdfs:///path/to/other/part-2.parquet.orc\r\n```\r\n\r\ntable ddl:\r\n```\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE symlink_orc ( name STRING, version DOUBLE, sort INT )\r\nROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde'\r\nSTORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.SymlinkTextInputFormat'\r\nOUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'\r\nLOCATION 'hdfs:///path/to/table';\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee details in the JIRA. [SPARK-32432](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32432)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n1. Before this pr, an exception was thrown when reading the ORC/Parquet files of SymlinkTextInputFormat table.\r\n2. Analyze SymlinkTextInputFormat table, will parse its real file size(such as ORC/Parquet files size), not the `manifest` file size, as described above \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded Unit Test:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the StateSchemaCompatibilityChecker which mistakenly swapped `from` (should be provided schema) and `to` (should be existing schema).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug mistakenly allows the case where it should not be allowed, and disallows the case where it should be allowed.\r\n\r\nThat allows nullable column to be stored into non-nullable column, which should be prohibited. This is less likely making runtime problem since state schema is conceptual one and row can be stored even not respecting the state schema.\r\n\r\nThe opposite case is worse, that disallows non-nullable column to be stored into nullable column, which should be allowed. Spark fails the query for this case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after the fix, storing non-nullable column into nullable column for state will be allowed, which should have been allowed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UTs.","created_at":"2022-03-04T06:13:43Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T02:38:27Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T02:04:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1aee8582808882d1327fb990a28224ecbc1effa2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPass `initialNumPartitions` into `RebalancePartitions`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRebalance partitions resolve the skew issue during shuffle dataset. It always returns an indeterminate partition number so at the beginning we do not pass partition as parameter.\r\n\r\nHowever, we find the initial partition number can affect the data compression ratio. So it would be better to make the partition number isolation.\r\n\r\nNote that, it only affects the initial partition number at map side during shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, after this pr user can do something like `SELECT /*+ REBALANCE(3, col) */ * FROM t`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAt present, the parameter of the factory method for obtaining JDBC connection is empty because the JDBC URL of some databases is fixed and unique.\r\nHowever, for databases such as ClickHouse, connection is related to the shard node.\r\nSo I think the parameter form of `getConnection: Partition = > Connection` is more general.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds factory method `getConnection` into `JDBCDialect` according to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35696#issuecomment-1058060107.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake factory method `getConnection` more general.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust inner change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis sets scala-maven-plugin.version to 4.4.0 except when the hadoop-2.7\r\nprofile is used, because SPARK-36547 shows that only 4.3.0 works there.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. If you try to build against a local snapshot of hadoop trunk with `-Dhadoop.version=3.4.0-SNAPSHOT` the build failes with the error shown in the JIRA.\r\n2. upgrading the scala plugin version fixes this. It is a plugin issue. \r\n3. the version is made configurable so the hadoop 2.7 profile can switch back to the one which works there.\r\n\r\nAs to why this only surfaces when compiling hadoop trunk, or why hadoop-2.7 requires the new one -who knows. they both look certificate related, which is interesting. maybe something related to signed JARs?\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nby successfully building spark against a local build of hadoop 3.4.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-03T18:25:56Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T12:02:09Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T01:23:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e70dddb5f8d07196572c1b224326fd34dbaf195","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4f44059f27d497ee981906cc612d7e4a6f01259","head":{"label":"steveloughran:SPARK-38394-compiler-version","ref":"SPARK-38394-compiler-version","sha":"d4f44059f27d497ee981906cc612d7e4a6f01259","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen ANSI mode is off, `ArrayType(DoubleType, containsNull = false)` can't cast as `ArrayType(IntegerType, containsNull = false)` since there can be overflow thus result in null results and breaks the non-null constraint.\r\n\r\nWhen ANSI mode is on, currently Spark SQL has the same behavior. However, this is not correct since the non-null constraint won't be break. Spark SQL can just execute the cast and throw runtime error on overflow, just like casting DoubleType as IntegerType.\r\n\r\nThis applies to MapType and StructType as well.  This PR is to loosen the limitation of casting non-null Array/Map/Struct types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor ANSI mode compliance\r\n<img width=\"559\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/156600154-24e3817b-ba22-45ce-a16f-faf7461af73e.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, for Cast under ANSI mode or table insertion, a complex type which don't contain null can be cast as another non-null complex type as long as the element types are castable. Before changes, this is only allowed when the source element type can be upcast to the target element type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-03-03T15:53:08Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T12:17:39Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T12:09:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0abc4ae483c4a28fe5da3f8a4492d338bfcc5be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/baa92c94d4848325cca5f2a65c0886fe91d6af23","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:canCast","ref":"canCast","sha":"baa92c94d4848325cca5f2a65c0886fe91d6af23","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncreasing the shuffle index weight with a constant number to avoid underestimating retained memory size caused by the bookkeeping objects: the `java.io.File` (depending on the path ~ 960 bytes) object and the `ShuffleIndexInformation` object (~180 bytes).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUnderestimating cache entry size easily can cause OOM in the Yarn NodeManager. \r\nIn the following analyses of a prod issue (HPROF file) we can see the leak suspect Guava's `LocalCache$Segment` objects:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"943\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-02-17 at 18 55 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154541995-44014212-2046-41d6-ba7f-99369ca7d739.png\">\r\n\r\nGoing further we can see a `ShuffleIndexInformation` for a small index file (16 bytes) but the retained heap memory is 1192 bytes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1351\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154645212-e0318d0f-cefa-4ae3-8a3b-97d2b506757d.png\">\r\n\r\nFinally we can see this is very common within this heap dump (using MAT's Object Query Language):\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1418\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154547678-44c8af34-1765-4e14-b71a-dc03d1a304aa.png\">\r\n\r\nI have even exported the data to a CSV and done some calculations with `awk`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tail -n+2 export.csv | awk -F, 'BEGIN { numUnderEstimated=0; } { sumOldSize += $1; corrected=$1 + 1176; sumCorrectedSize += corrected; sumRetainedMem += $2; if (corrected < $2) numUnderEstimated+=1; } END { print \"sum old size: \" sumOldSize / 1024 / 1024   \" MB, sum corrected size: \" sumCorrectedSize / 1024 / 1024 \" MB, sum retained memory:\" sumRetainedMem / 1024 / 1024  \" MB, num under estimated: \" numUnderEstimated }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gives the followings:\r\n```\r\nsum old size: 76.8785 MB, sum corrected size: 1066.93 MB, sum retained memory:1064.47 MB, num under estimated: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo using the old calculation we were at 7.6.8 MB way under the default cache limit (100 MB). \r\nUsing the correction (applying 1176 as increment to the size) we are at 1066.93 MB (~1GB) which is close to the real retained sum heap: 1064.47 MB (~1GB) and there is no entry which was underestimated.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further and get rid of `java.io.File` completely and store the `ShuffleIndexInformation` for the file path.\r\nThis way not only the cache size estimate is improved but the its size is decreased as well. \r\nHere the path size is not counted into the cache size as that string is interned. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith the calculations above.","created_at":"2022-03-03T14:02:14Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T18:53:28Z","closed_at":"2022-03-04T18:53:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4891b2a1d76e028c0a494ddd063f7db7cd05b161","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76878fa41b83e5145e35b19a45fde8c56f44444a","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-33206-3.0","ref":"SPARK-33206-3.0","sha":"76878fa41b83e5145e35b19a45fde8c56f44444a","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncreasing the shuffle index weight with a constant number to avoid underestimating retained memory size caused by the bookkeeping objects: the `java.io.File` (depending on the path ~ 960 bytes) object and the `ShuffleIndexInformation` object (~180 bytes).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUnderestimating cache entry size easily can cause OOM in the Yarn NodeManager. \r\nIn the following analyses of a prod issue (HPROF file) we can see the leak suspect Guava's `LocalCache$Segment` objects:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"943\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-02-17 at 18 55 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154541995-44014212-2046-41d6-ba7f-99369ca7d739.png\">\r\n\r\nGoing further we can see a `ShuffleIndexInformation` for a small index file (16 bytes) but the retained heap memory is 1192 bytes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1351\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154645212-e0318d0f-cefa-4ae3-8a3b-97d2b506757d.png\">\r\n\r\nFinally we can see this is very common within this heap dump (using MAT's Object Query Language):\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1418\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154547678-44c8af34-1765-4e14-b71a-dc03d1a304aa.png\">\r\n\r\nI have even exported the data to a CSV and done some calculations with `awk`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tail -n+2 export.csv | awk -F, 'BEGIN { numUnderEstimated=0; } { sumOldSize += $1; corrected=$1 + 1176; sumCorrectedSize += corrected; sumRetainedMem += $2; if (corrected < $2) numUnderEstimated+=1; } END { print \"sum old size: \" sumOldSize / 1024 / 1024   \" MB, sum corrected size: \" sumCorrectedSize / 1024 / 1024 \" MB, sum retained memory:\" sumRetainedMem / 1024 / 1024  \" MB, num under estimated: \" numUnderEstimated }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gives the followings:\r\n```\r\nsum old size: 76.8785 MB, sum corrected size: 1066.93 MB, sum retained memory:1064.47 MB, num under estimated: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo using the old calculation we were at 7.6.8 MB way under the default cache limit (100 MB). \r\nUsing the correction (applying 1176 as increment to the size) we are at 1066.93 MB (~1GB) which is close to the real retained sum heap: 1064.47 MB (~1GB) and there is no entry which was underestimated.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further and get rid of `java.io.File` completely and store the `ShuffleIndexInformation` for the file path.\r\nThis way not only the cache size estimate is

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUnify the `getMapLocation` and `getLocationsWithLargestOutputs` in `MapOutputTrackerMaster`. So we can remove `getMapLocation` that is only called at `ShuffledRowRDD`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt has several issues with method `ShuffledRowRDD#getPreferredLocations`.\r\n\r\n- it does not respect the config `spark.shuffle.reduceLocality.enabled`, so we can not disable it.\r\n- it does not respect `REDUCER_PREF_LOCS_FRACTION`, so it has no effect if DAG schedule task to an executor who has less data. In worse, driver will take more memory to store the useless locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, it's code refactor and improve the perfermance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nApache Spark has been supporting many K8s features via `spark.kubernetes.driver.podTemplateFile` and `spark.kubernetes.executor.podTemplateFile` in an extensible way. This PR aims to add an integration test case for `priorityClassName` pod spec.\r\n\r\nIn this test case, we use one of the K8s built-in priority classes because we want to run this test on heterogenous K8s environments. In addition, `schedule` test tag is added for some esoteric K8s environments without `system-node-critical` priority class or `system-node-critical` with different values.\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#marking-pod-as-critical\r\n```\r\n$ k get priorityclass              \r\nNAME                      VALUE        GLOBAL-DEFAULT   AGE\r\nsystem-cluster-critical   2000000000   false            4h19m\r\nsystem-node-critical      2000001000   false            4h19m\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe don't need to enumerate all K8s spec via `spark.kubernetes.xxx` configurations. PodTemplate can do many things.\r\nThis example will help the future works for customer schedulers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the K8s IT. This is tested like the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Psparkr -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests -Dtest.exclude.tags=minikube -Dspark.kubernetes.test.deployMode=docker-for-desktop \"kubernetes-integration-tests/test\"\r\n...\r\n[info] KubernetesSuite:\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with no resources (8 seconds, 866 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with no resources & statefulset allocation (10 seconds, 700 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with a very long application name.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current implementation of DynamicJoinSelection the logic checks if one side of the join has high ratio of empty partitions and adds a NO_BROADCAST hint on that side since a shuffle join can short-circuit the local joins where one side is empty.\r\n\r\nThis logic is doesn't make sense for all join type. For example, a Left Outer Join cannot short circuit if RHS is empty so we should not inhibit BHJ. On the other hand a LOJ executed as a shuffle join where the LHS has many empty can short circuit the local join so we should inhibit the BHJ because BHJ will use OptimizeShuffleWithLocalRead which will re-assemble LHS partitions as the were before the shuffle and thus may not have many empty ones any more.\r\n\r\nThis supersedes [SPARK-37193](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37193)\r\nAlso see previous discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34464#discussion_r774630446\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt may change which joins run as BHJ vs shuffle joins\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncreasing the shuffle index weight with a constant number to avoid underestimating retained memory size caused by the bookkeeping objects: the `java.io.File` (depending on the path ~ 960 bytes) object and the `ShuffleIndexInformation` object (~180 bytes).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUnderestimating cache entry size easily can cause OOM in the Yarn NodeManager. \r\nIn the following analyses of a prod issue (HPROF file) we can see the leak suspect Guava's `LocalCache$Segment` objects:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"943\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-02-17 at 18 55 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154541995-44014212-2046-41d6-ba7f-99369ca7d739.png\">\r\n\r\nGoing further we can see a `ShuffleIndexInformation` for a small index file (16 bytes) but the retained heap memory is 1192 bytes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1351\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154645212-e0318d0f-cefa-4ae3-8a3b-97d2b506757d.png\">\r\n\r\nFinally we can see this is very common within this heap dump (using MAT's Object Query Language):\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1418\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154547678-44c8af34-1765-4e14-b71a-dc03d1a304aa.png\">\r\n\r\nI have even exported the data to a CSV and done some calculations with `awk`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tail -n+2 export.csv | awk -F, 'BEGIN { numUnderEstimated=0; } { sumOldSize += $1; corrected=$1 + 1176; sumCorrectedSize += corrected; sumRetainedMem += $2; if (corrected < $2) numUnderEstimated+=1; } END { print \"sum old size: \" sumOldSize / 1024 / 1024   \" MB, sum corrected size: \" sumCorrectedSize / 1024 / 1024 \" MB, sum retained memory:\" sumRetainedMem / 1024 / 1024  \" MB, num under estimated: \" numUnderEstimated }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gives the followings:\r\n```\r\nsum old size: 76.8785 MB, sum corrected size: 1066.93 MB, sum retained memory:1064.47 MB, num under estimated: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo using the old calculation we were at 7.6.8 MB way under the default cache limit (100 MB). \r\nUsing the correction (applying 1176 as increment to the size) we are at 1066.93 MB (~1GB) which is close to the real retained sum heap: 1064.47 MB (~1GB) and there is no entry which was underestimated.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further and get rid of `java.io.File` completely and store the `ShuffleIndexInformation` for the file path.\r\nThis way not only the cache size estimate is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`GenSeq/GenMap`  is identified as `@deprecated` since Scala 2.13.0 and `Gen* collection types have been removed`.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for Scala 2.12：\r\n\r\n-  `trait Map[K, +V] extends Iterable[(K, V)] with GenMap[K, V] with MapLike[K, V, Map[K, V]]`\r\n- `trait Seq[+A] extends PartialFunction[Int, A] with Iterable[A] with GenSeq[A] with GenericTraversableTemplate[A, Seq] with SeqLike[A, Seq[A]]`\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to declare as `GenSeq/GenMap`, so this pr change to use `Map/Seq` to clean up deprecated usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up deprecated usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are two small proposals:\r\n1) prefix the name of the temporary k8s namespaces with `\"spark-\"` so that the output of `kubectl get ns\" is more clear.\r\n2) unify the name of the driver pod in non-test and IT tests to always use `-driver` as a suffix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAt the moment the name of the temporary namespace is just UUID without the `-`s. When one reads the result of `kubectl get ns` it is a bit cryptic to see UUIDs.\r\n\r\nThe names of the driver pods in ITs are not telling me that they are Drivers.\r\nIn non-test (i.e. production) the driver pod names are suffixed with `-driver`. I propose the same for IT tests.\r\nExecutor pods always use `-exec-` in their pod names, both in non-test and ITs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes! Developers who debug IT tests will see more clear names now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually with `kubectl get ns --watch` and `kubectl get po

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add two aliases for the `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` function introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35607:\r\n- `DATEDIFF()`\r\n- `DATE_DIFF()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier.\r\n2. To achieve feature parity with other DBMSs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The new aliases just extend Spark SQL API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SQLKeywordSuite\"\r\n```\r\n3. and new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent PR is to bring up a new optimizer rule `CombineScalarSubquery` to combine compatible scalar subqueries.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of  `CombineScalarSubquery`  is combining compatible aggregate plans served for scalar-subquery as much as possible. Aggregates sharing the same \"base plan\" with other aggregates are considered as compatible. This rule is supposed to combine all groups of compatible aggregates. And create a unified fused aggregate for each group, which can serve multiple scalar subqueries. The \"base plan\" refers to the top non-project descendant of the Aggregate, which means it could be either the child of Aggregate or the child of Aggregate(Project(...)).\r\n\r\nTo be specific, `CombineScalarSubquery` consists of three steps:\r\n1. Collect combination candidates from scalar sub-queries. Assign these candidates into different groups according to the canonicalized base plan.\r\n2. Combine collected candidates of each group with an unified base plan to build fused aggregates.\r\n3. Replace ScalarSubqueries with SharedScalarSubqueries based on fused aggregates.\r\n\r\nBelow is a sample query to illustrate how `CombineScalarSubquery` works as a optimizer rule:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT SUM(i) FROM t\r\nWHERE l > (SELECT MIN(l2) FROM t) AND l2 < (SELECT MAX(l) FROM t)\r\nAND AND i2 <> (SELECT MAX(i2) FROM t) AND i2 <> (SELECT MIN(i2) FROM t)\r\n```\r\nBefore the apply of `CombineScalarSubquery`, the optimized logicial plan looks like:\r\n```\r\nAggregate [sum(i)]\r\n+- Project [i]\r\n  +- Filter (((l > scalar-subquery#1) AND (l2 < scalar-subquery#2)) AND (NOT (i2 = scalar-subquery#3) AND NOT (i2 = scalar-subquery#4)))\r\n     :  :- Aggregate [min(l2)]\r\n     :  :  +- Project [l2]\r\n     :  :     +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n     :  +- Aggregate [max(l)]\r\n     :     +- Project [l]\r\n     :        +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n     :  +- Aggregate [max(i2)]\r\n     :     +- Project [l]\r\n     :        +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n     :  +- Aggregate [min(i2)]\r\n     :     +- Project [l]\r\n     :        +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n     +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n```\r\nAfter the apply of `CombineScalarSubquery`:\r\n```\r\n Aggregate [sum(i)]\r\n +- Project [i]\r\n   +- Filter (((l > shared-scalar-subquery#1) AND (l2 < shared-scalar-subquery#2)) AND (NOT (i2 = shared-scalar-subquery#3) AND NOT (i2 = shared-scalar-subquery#4)))\r\n      :  :- Aggregate [min(l2),max(l),max(i2),min(i2)]\r\n      :  :  +- Project [l2,l,i2]\r\n      :  :     +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n      :  :- Aggregate [min(l2),max(l),max(i2),min(i2)]\r\n      :  :  +- Project [l2,l,i2]\r\n      :        +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n      :  :- Aggregate [min(l2),max(l),max(i2),min(i2)]\r\n      :  :  +- Project [l2,l,i2]\r\n      :        +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n      :  :- Aggregate [min(l2),max(l),max(i2),min(i2)]\r\n      :  :  +- Project [l2,l,i2]\r\n      :        +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n      +- Relation [l,l2,i,i2]\r\n```\r\nIn this case, all four sub-queries are compatible. Therefore, they can share the same fused subquery plan. During the preparation of physical plan, these fuesd aggregates will be detected and reused by the rule  `ReuseExchangeAndSubquery`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo accelerate Spark SQL on queries which are composed of many compatible scalar subqueries, such as: [TPC-DS query9](https://github.com/Agirish/tpcds/blob/master/query9.sql)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch is verified with unit test. Tests cases are added in `SubquerySuite` and `AdaptiveQueryExec` to make sure thispatch works correctly in terms of logical plan and physical plan (AQE enabled).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR handles the case 1 mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38385:\r\n* Before\r\n    ```\r\n    ParseException: \r\n

```\r\n    ParseException: \r\n    syntax error at or near 'sel'(line 1, pos 0)\r\n    \r\n    == SQL ==\r\n    sel 1\r\n    ^^^ \r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Implementation general idea\r\nANTLR uses the DefaultErrorStrategy class to create error messages: \r\n\r\n```scala\r\npublic class DefaultErrorStrategy implements ANTLRErrorStrategy {\r\n  protected void reportInputMismatch(Parser recognizer, InputMismatchException e)\r\n  {\r\n\tString msg = \"mismatched input \" + \r\n                    getTokenErrorDisplay(e.getOffendingToken()) + \" expecting \" +\r\n                    e.getExpectedTokens().toString(recognizer.getVocabulary());\r\n\trecognizer.notifyErrorListeners(e.getOffendingToken(), msg, e);\r\n  }\r\n  ..\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt is easy to extend the `DefaultErrorStrategy` and override corresponding functions to output better error messages. Then in our parser, set the error strategy to be the one we created.\r\n\r\n#### Changes in code\r\nTo achieve this, the following changes are made:\r\n* error-classes.json\r\n    Define a new type of error `PARSE_INPUT_MISMATCHED` with the new error framework:\r\n    ```json\r\n      \"PARSE_INPUT_MISMATCHED\" : {\r\n        \"message\" : [ \"syntax error at or near %s\" ],\r\n        \"sqlState\" : \"42000\"\r\n      },\r\n    ```\r\n* SparkParserErrorStrategy.scala\r\n    This is a new class, extending the `org.antlr.v4.runtime.DefaultErrorStrategy` that does special handling on errors. Note the original `DefaultErrorStrategy` is where the `mismatched input` error message generates from. \r\n    The new class is intended to provide more information, e.g. the error class and the message parameters, on these errors encountered in ANTLR parser to the downstream consumers to be able to apply the `SparkThrowable` error message framework to these exceptions.\r\n\r\n* ParserDriver.scala\r\n  * It sets the error strategy of the parser to be the above new `SparkParserErrorStrategy`.\r\n  * When catching an exception thrown from ANTLR, when it can find out the error class and message parameter, it creates `ParseException` with this information, which composes the error message through `SparkThrowableHelper.getMessage`. It then formalizes the standard error messages of these types.\r\n\r\n* test suites\r\n    It change all affected test suites. It also adds a check on the error class, note the newly added `PARSE_INPUT_MISMATCHED` in the after case:\r\n    ```scala\r\n    // before\r\n    intercept(\"select * from r order by q from t\", 1, 27, 31,\r\n      \"mismatched input\",\r\n      \"---------------------------^^^\")\r\n    // after\r\n    intercept(\"select * from r order by q from t\", \"PARSE_INPUT_MISMATCHED\",\r\n      1, 27, 31,\r\n      \"syntax error at or near\",\r\n      \"---------------------------^^^\"\r\n    )\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38384 The description states the reason for the change.\r\nTLDR, the error messages of ParseException directly coming from ANTLR are not user-friendly and we want to improve it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIf the error messages change are considered as user-facing change, then yes.\r\nThe changes in the error message:\r\n1. Adjust the words, from ‘mismatched input {}’ to a more readable one, ‘syntax error at or near {}.’. This also aligns with the PostgreSQL error messages. \r\n2. Remove the expecting full list.\r\n\r\nOne example case is listed in the top of this PR description.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThrough manual local tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-02T06:01:26Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T01:26:17Z","closed_at":"2022-03-08T01:26:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e89d6af964fb926e90871f0ca652005179c33d91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e631ec0bdcfeaa894465b768f2d0283bba9b3d5","head":{"label":"anchovYu:improve-parse-exception-mismatched-input","ref":"improve-parse-exception-mismatched-input","sha":"5e631ec0bdcfeaa894465b768f2d0283bba9b3d5","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport `na_action` and Series input correspondence in `Series.map`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reach parity to pandas API.\r\n\r\nNote that `na_action` is supported in older pandas:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> pd.__version__\r\n'1.0.0'\r\n>>> pser = pd.Series(['a', 'b', None])\r\n>>> pser.map(lambda x : x.upper(), na_action='ignore')\r\n0       A\r\n1       B\r\n2    None\r\ndtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `na_action`, Series input correspondence are supported now:\r\n```py\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series(['cat', 'dog', None, 'rabbit'])\r\n\r\n# na_action support\r\n>>> psser.map(lambda x : x.upper(), na_action=\"ignore\")\r\n0       CAT                                                                     \r\n1       DOG\r\n2      None\r\n3    RABBIT\r\ndtype: object\r\n\r\n# Series input correspondence support\r\n>>> pser_to_apply = pd.Series([\"one\", \"two\", \"four\"], index=[\"cat\", \"dog\", \"rabbit\"])\r\n>>> psser.map(pser_to_apply)\r\n0     one\r\n1     two\r\n2    None\r\n3    four\r\ndtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `APP_ID` and `EXECUTOR_ID` placeholder in K8s annotation in the same way we did for `EXECUTOR_JAVA_OPTIONS`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Apache Spark provides `spark-app-id` already, some custom schedulers are not able to recognize them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because the pattern strings are very specific.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and K8s IT.\r\n\r\nThis passed like the following on `Docker Desktop K8s`.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Psparkr -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests -Dtest.exclude.tags=minikube -Dspark.kubernetes.test.deployMode=docker-for-desktop

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSeparating the mixed parser grammar defined in `SqlBase.g4` into separate parser and lexer grammars.\r\n* The parser grammar disallows any literal definitions. Thus all literals are replaced with names defined in the new lexer.\r\n* The lexer and parser has to be provided in two files. As ANTLR only allows one grammar per file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis gives us a cleaner separation of parser and lexer in the original grammar. \r\nIt also enables us to use the full power of ANTLR parser and lexer grammars: \r\n* Access to lexer specific rules: lexer specific rules (e.g. [Lexer mode](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/lexer-rules.md#lexical-modes)) can be used for new SQL features.\r\n* Ability to reuse lexer rules: we can now use inheritance to have multiple lexers sharing a common set of lexical rules.\r\n* Clear order of tokens: the order the tokens are tokenized by the lexer in the order they appear in the lexer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests. The refactoring should not break any tests.","created_at":"2022-03-01T20:13:36Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T16:30:35Z","closed_at":"2022-03-03T13:42:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"072631cf40ddb092aee218e12ba2768e096797c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90631e538292d65cc0be2d9a6c57e424ec39d911","head":{"label":"zhenlineo:parser-lexer","ref":"parser-lexer","sha":"90631e538292d65cc0be2d9a6c57e424ec39d911","user":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464980742,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7cLBg","name":"spark","full_name":"zhenlineo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better adoption of the ANSI mode. Since both APIs are for getting a quick summary of the Dataframe, I suggest using `TryCast` for the problematic stats so that both APIs still work under ANSI mode. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAt present, the parameter of the factory method for obtaining JDBC connection is empty because the JDBC URL of some databases is fixed and unique.\r\nHowever, for databases such as ClickHouse, connection is related to the shard node.\r\nSo I think the parameter form of `getConnection: Option[Partition] = > Connection` is more general.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake factory method `getConnection` more general.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust inner change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRespects user`s input instead of straight overriding Kafka Parameters to hard-coded value\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe streaming behavior is unpredictable/misleading, users think they set auto.reset.offset value but Spark override them invisibly ( hard to notice that logging message)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-01T09:06:08Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T20:29:05Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T20:17:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40b153528501398671c9e560d408c34ff23a7d55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35695/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35695/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35695/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e97907171fa470132b8384ee7770497271bc1ed9","head":{"label":"dulu98Kurz:master","ref":"master","sha":"e97907171fa470132b8384ee7770497271bc1ed9","user":{"login":"dulu98Kurz","id":14854898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODU0ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14854898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz","html_url":"https://github.com/dulu98Kurz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464816178,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7SIMg","name":"spark","full_name":"dulu98Kurz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dulu98Kurz","id":14854898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODU0ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14854898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz","html_url":"https://github.com/dulu98Kurz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dulu98Kurz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dulu98Kurz/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr follows up the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35492, try to use a stagingDir constant instead of the  stagingDir method in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35492#issuecomment-1054910730\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build/sbt -mem 4096 -Phadoop-2

java.io.NotSerializableException: org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt's because org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path is serializable in Hadoop3 but not in Hadoop2.  So, we should make the stagingDir  transient to avoid that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPassed `./build/sbt -mem 4096

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImplement parser changes needed to support for DEFAULT column values as tracked in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38334.\r\n\r\nNote that these are the parser changes only. Analysis support will take place in a following PR.\r\n\r\nBackground: in the future, CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE invocations will support setting column default values for later operations. Following INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE statements may then reference the value using the DEFAULT keyword as needed.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE T(a INT, b INT NOT NULL);\r\n\r\n-- The default default is NULL\r\nINSERT INTO T VALUES (DEFAULT, 0);\r\nINSERT INTO T(b)  VALUES (1);\r\nSELECT * FROM T;\r\n(NULL, 0)\r\n(NULL, 1)\r\n\r\n-- Adding a default to a table with rows, sets the values for the\r\n-- existing rows (exist default) and new rows (current default).\r\nALTER TABLE T ADD COLUMN c INT DEFAULT 5;\r\nINSERT INTO T VALUES (1, 2, DEFAULT);\r\nSELECT * FROM T;\r\n(NULL, 0, 5)\r\n(NULL, 1, 5)\r\n(1, 2, 5) \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis new API helps users run DDL and DML statements to add new values to tables and scan existing values from tables more easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR relaxes the constraint added in [SPARK-35080](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35080) by allowing safe up-cast expressions in correlated equality predicates.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCast expressions are often added by the compiler during query analysis. Correlated equality predicates can be less restrictive to support this common pattern if a cast expression guarantees one-to-one mapping between the child expression and the output datatype (safe up-cast).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Safe up-cast expressions are allowed in correlated equality predicates:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (SELECT SUM(b) FROM VALUES (1, 1), (1, 2) t(a, b) WHERE CAST(a AS STRING) = x)\r\nFROM VALUES ('1'), ('2') t(x)\r\n```\r\nBefore this change, this query will throw AnalysisException \"Correlated column is not allowed in predicate...\", and after this change, this query can run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add magic method \\_\\_enter\\_\\_ and \\_\\_exit\\_\\_ into **the special_function list**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Improve the usage data accuracy for **with statement** so that external \\_\\_enter\\_\\_ and \\_\\_exit\\_\\_ calls are captured instead of internal calls\r\n\r\nFor example, for the code below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npdf = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    [(0.2, 0.3), (0.0, 0.6), (0.6, 0.0), (0.2, 0.1)], columns=[\"dogs\", \"cats\"]\r\n)\r\npsdf = ps.from_pandas(pdf)\r\n\r\nwith psdf.spark.cache() as cached_df:\r\n    self.assert_eq(isinstance(cached_df, CachedDataFrame), True)\r\n    self.assert_eq(\r\n        repr(cached_df.spark.storage_level), repr(StorageLevel(True, True, False, True))\r\n    )\r\n ```\r\n\r\nPandas-on-Spark usage logger records the internal call [self.spark.unpersist()](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/pandas/frame.py#L12518) since \\_\\_enter\\_\\_ and \\_\\_exit\\_\\_ methods of [CachedDataFrame](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/pandas/frame.py#L12492) are not instrumented. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-28T18:47:11Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T17:29:38Z","closed_at":"2022-03-03T11:51:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dce5dbf81950dd994674bfe02c4917677623286","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6b9fa9f5a689259aed7813b469a3c04eceb40ac","head":{"label":"heyihong:SPARK-38353","ref":"SPARK-38353","sha":"a6b9fa9f5a689259aed7813b469a3c04eceb40ac","user":{"login":"heyihong","id":7093703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTM3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7093703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong","html_url":"https://github.com/heyihong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464558339,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7CZAw","name":"spark","full_name":"heyihong/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heyihong","id":7093703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTM3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7093703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong","html_url":"https://github.com/heyihong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyihong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heyihong/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor hash aggregate, there's a SQL metrics to track number of hash probes per looked-up key. It would be better to add a similar metrics for shuffled hash join as well, to get some idea of hash probing performance. Also renamed the existing SQL metrics (and related methods names) in hash aggregate, from `avg hash probe bucket list iters` to `avg hash probes per key`, as the original name is quite obscured to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo show up in Spark web UI (and allow metrics collection) for shuffled hash join probing performance. When the metrics is more closer to 1.0, the probing performance is better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the added SQL metrics. Will attach screenshot later.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe modified unit test in `SQLMetricsSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2022-02-28T17:23:13Z","updated_at":"2022-04-25T05:36:55Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T15:53:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e9aa8070a0a715ccc9d18372f856a1718e01eef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c56b98c32347a1291dcaaafc1d80cf4c4daddbb","head":{"label":"c21:probe-metrics","ref":"probe-metrics","sha":"3c56b98c32347a1291dcaaafc1d80cf4c4daddbb","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

When we join with duplicate view, the query would be successful.\r\nDeduplicateRelations should only kick in if the plan's children are all resolved and valid.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe V1 \"DESC TABLE EXTENDED\" command contains info of \"Database\" and \"Table\", which can be used by external tools like DBT: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17394\r\n\r\nHowever, the V2 version contains only one field \"name\" representing \"catalog.database.table\". External tools can't recognize it. \r\nAlso, it is weird to have different command outputs from the same command.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make the database/table name output of V1/V2 \"desc extended table\" consistent. For the output of V2 tables, this PR also shows the catalog name in the output.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the database/table name output of V1/V2 \"desc extended table\" consistent so that it can be parsed by external tools like DBT.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it changes the database/table name output of V2 \"desc extended table\" so that it becomes consistent with V1 tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-02-28T13:04:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T13:18:33Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T13:18:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba771ff85ea564a82c66f3111fe4b3e4824261d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74187111a2b6c32717344c9dad689c233ac40296","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixDesc","ref":"fixDesc","sha":"74187111a2b6c32717344c9dad689c233ac40296","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims upgrade `com.google.crypto.tink:tink` from 1.6.0 to 1.6.1\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/google/tink/releases/tag/v1.6.1\r\n\r\nThere is a performance optimization related to `AesGcmJce.encrypt` method in version 1.6.1 and this method used by `o.a.s.network.crypto.AuthEngine#challenge` and `o.a.s.network.crypto.AuthEngine#response` methods in Spark:\r\n\r\n- [Java: isAndroid() shouldn't cause Exceptions to be created](https://github.com/google/tink/issues/497)\r\n\r\nThis optimization reduces the delay of `AesGcmJce.encrypt` method by 70%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GA\r\n- Manual test:\r\n\r\nVerify the performance improvement of `AesGcmJce.encrypt` method as follows:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport the hidden file source metadata in streaming, you could do the same thing as batch read/write as follows:\r\n```\r\nspark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  ...\r\n  .select(\"*\", \"_metadata\")\r\n  .writeStream\r\n  ...\r\n  .start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd more support to the hidden file metadata feature.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use StatefulOpClusteredDistribution for stateful operators which requires exact order of clustering keys without allowing sub-clustering keys, so that stateful operators will have consistent partitioning across lifetime of the query. \r\n(It doesn't cover the case grouping keys are changed. We have state schema checker verifying on the changes, but changing name is allowed so swapping keys with same data type is still allowed. So there are still grey areas.)\r\n\r\nThe change will break the existing queries having checkpoint in prior to Spark 3.3 and bring silent correctness issues. To remedy the problem, we introduce a new internal config `spark.sql.streaming.statefulOperator.useStrictDistribution`, which defaults to true for new queries but defaults to false for queries starting from checkpoint in prior to Spark 3.3. If the new config is set to false, stateful operator will use ClusteredDistribution which retains the old requirement of child distribution. \r\n\r\nNote that in this change we don't fix the root problem against old checkpoints. Long-term fix should be crafted carefully, after collecting evidence on the impact of SPARK-38204. (e.g. how many queries on end users would encounter SPARK-38204.)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds E2E tests for the cases which trigger SPARK-38204, and verify the behavior with new query (3.3) & old query (in prior to 3.3).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPlease refer the description of JIRA issue [SPARK-38024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38204) for details, since the description is quite long to include here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, stateful operators no longer accept the child output partitioning having subset of grouping keys and trigger additional shuffle. This will ensure consistent partitioning with stateful operators across lifetime of the query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs including backward compatibility are added.","created_at":"2022-02-28T04:04:04Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T03:07:16Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T20:29:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ccbffbf6dfd47300e9c391366fb4aaaa462e801","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce SQL function ARRAY_SIZE.\r\n\r\nARRAY_SIZE works the same as SIZE when the input is an array except for:\r\n- ARRAY_SIZE raises an exception for non-array input.\r\n- ARRAY_SIZE always returns null for null input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCounting elements within an array is a common use case. ARRAY_SIZE ensures the input to be an array and then returns the size.\r\n\r\nOther DBRMS like Snowflake supports that as well: [Snowflake ARRAY_SIZE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/array_size.html). Implementing that improves compatibility with DBMS and makes migration easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYea. `array_size` is available now.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select array_size(array(2, 1))\").show()\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|array_size(array(2, 1))|\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|                      2|\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select array_size(map('a', 1, 'b', 2))\").show()\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'array_size(map('a', 1, 'b', 2))'

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAt present, the Filter is divided into DataFilter and PartitionFilter when it is pushed down, and use PartitionFilter to prune partition and use DataFilter to prune data. However, the pruned down DataFilter contains all data filter for all partitions, not for one specific partition, which may lead to a bad behavior such as scan all data of each partition.\r\nThis pr will push down dataFilter with PartitionFilter, and evaluate and prune partitionFilter at runtime before push to parquet, which can push less filter to parquet.\r\n\r\nHere is a example.\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.range(0, 1000).withColumnRenamed(\"id\", \"a\").withColumn(\"b\", $\"a\")\r\ndf.withColumn(\"c\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip mount files in hadoop conf if they are binary or very large to fit the configMap's max size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConfig map cannot hold binary files and there is also a limit on how much data a configMap can hold.\r\nAnd spark conf limit has been done in [SPARK-32221].\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, in simple words avoids possible errors due to negligence (for example, placing a large file or a binary file in SPARK_CONF_DIR) and thus improves user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nActually testing in k8s cluster and existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd yunikorn feature step in order to support yunikorn scheduler. [Apache yunikorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/) is an open-source batch scheduler for K8s, designed to solve the problems of running batch workloads, e.g Spark, on K8s.  This PR will add a build profile yunikorn, the yunikorn feature step, UT, and integration tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduced the bare minimal changes for the integration with yunikorn. YuniKorn has a concept of the application, and a pod will only be scheduled if it belongs to an application. Therefore, it needs to identify which pod belongs to which application. This is done by looking at the pod annotation: `yunikorn.apache.org/app-id`, and this must be a unique ID per job. In this PR, we automatically set this pod annotation with value equals to spark appID for all the driver and executor pods.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a part of the effort [SPARK-36057](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36057), in order to make Spark natively support customized K8s schedulers. This PR particularly is similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35422. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nOnce this is done, user can easily submit their jobs to yunikorn scheduler with the following configs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--conf spark.kubernete.driver.scheduler.name=yunikorn \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.featureSteps=org.apache.spark.deploy.k8s.features.scheduler.YuniKornFeatureStep\r\n```\r\non a yunikorn enabled cluster, the Spark job will be scheduled by the yunikorn scheduler instead of the default scheduler.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### UT\r\n\r\n#### Integration tests\r\n\r\nOn docker-desktop 4.4.2, K8s 1.22.5, I've run the integration tests with and without yunikorn profile:\r\n\r\nwithout yunikorn\r\n```\r\nresource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh --exclude-tags minikube,r --deploy-mode docker-desktop\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Spark Project Parent POM 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Spark Project Parent POM ...........................

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix canonicalization NPE, maybe is a proof of [spark-35742](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32885),just as [SPARK-23731](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21815) says\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is a bug:\r\nrun this sql in yarn client mode,it will generate DynamicPruningExpression:\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists test_a_pt;\r\ncreate table  test_a_pt(col1 int, col2 int,pt string) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (pt);\r\ninsert into table test_a_pt values(1,2,'20220101'),(3,4,'20220101'),(1,2,'20220101'),(3,4,'20220101'),(1,2,'20220101'),(3,4,'20220101');\r\n\r\ndrop table if exists test_b;\r\ncreate table test_b as select 1 as `搜索demo_uv` ,2 as `搜索demo_gmv`, 'gogo' as scenes, '2021-03-04' as date1;\r\n\r\ndrop table if exists dest;\r\ncreate table dest as \r\nSELECT  a.pt,\r\n        a.scenes\r\nFROM    (\r\n            SELECT   '20220101' as pt\r\n                     ,'comeon' AS scenes\r\n            FROM    test_b where scenes='gogo' and exists(array(date1),x-> x =='2021-03-04')\r\n            UNION ALL\r\n            SELECT  pt as pt\r\n                     ,'comeon' AS scenes\r\n            FROM    (\r\n                        SELECT  pt,COUNT( distinct col2) AS buy_tab_uv\r\n                        FROM    test_a_pt\r\n                        where pt='20220101'\r\n                        GROUP BY pt \r\n                    ) a\r\n        ) a\r\nJOIN    (\r\n            SELECT  pt ,COUNT(distinct col2) AS buy_tab_uv\r\n                    FROM  test_a_pt\r\n                    where pt='20220101'\r\n                    GROUP BY pt \r\n        ) b\r\nON      a.pt = b.pt\r\n;\r\n\r\n```\r\nBTW, function: exists extends CodegenFallback.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is addExprTree funtion in EquivalentExpressions:\r\n```\r\n\r\ndef addExprTree(\r\nexpr: Expression,\r\naddFunc: Expression => Boolean = addExpr): Unit = {\r\nval skip = expr.isInstanceOf[LeafExpression] ||\r\n// `LambdaVariable` is usually used as a loop variable, which can't be evaluated ahead of the\r\n// loop.

expressions : DynamicPruningExpression(InSubqueryExec(value, broadcastValues, exprId),    \r\nthen executor will compile code, NPE will appears.\r\n\r\nso, we should iterator all children,\r\n` (expr.find(_.isInstanceOf[PlanExpression[_]]).isDefined && TaskContext.get != null)`,     \r\nif PlanExpression found, such as  InSubqueryExec, we should skip addExprTree, then NPE will disappears.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes,\r\nbefore this pr:\r\nNPE will

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add two aliases for the `TIMESTAMPADD()` function introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35502:\r\n- `DATEADD()`\r\n- `DATE_ADD()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier.\r\n2. To achieve feature parity with other DBMSs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The new aliases just extend Spark SQL API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SQLKeywordSuite\"\r\n```\r\n3. and new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe formatted explalin mode is the powerful explain mode to show the details of query plan. In AQE, the query stage know its statistics if has already materialized. So it can help to quick check the conversion of plan, e.g. join selection. \r\n\r\nA simple example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t JOIN t2 ON t.c = t2.c;\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (21)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   * SortMergeJoin Inner (13)\r\n   :- * Sort (6)\r\n   :  +- AQEShuffleRead (5)\r\n   :     +- ShuffleQueryStage (4), Statistics(sizeInBytes=16.0 B, rowCount=1)\r\n   :        +- Exchange (3)\r\n   :           +- * Filter (2)\r\n   :              +- Scan hive default.t (1)\r\n   +- * Sort (12)\r\n      +- AQEShuffleRead (11)\r\n         +- ShuffleQueryStage (10), Statistics(sizeInBytes=16.0 B, rowCount=1)\r\n            +- Exchange (9)\r\n               +- * Filter (8)\r\n                  +- Scan hive default.t2 (7)\r\n+- == Initial Plan ==\r\n   SortMergeJoin Inner (20)\r\n   :- Sort (16)\r\n   :  +- Exchange (15)\r\n   :     +- Filter (14)\r\n   :        +- Scan hive default.t (1)\r\n   +- Sort (19)\r\n      +- Exchange (18)\r\n         +- Filter (17)\r\n            +- Scan hive default.t2 (7)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only change the output of explain in AQE\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

This PR completely replace it following the catalyst `Partitioning` interface, and added two concrete sub-classes: `KeyGroupedPartitioning` and `UnknownPartitioning`. This allows a V2 data source to report to Spark it's partition transform expressions, via `SupportsReportPartitioning` interface.\r\n- with the above change, `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioning.Distribution` and `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioning.ClusteredDistribution` now are replaced by classes with the same name in `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.distributions` package. Therefore, this PR marks the former two as deprecated.\r\n- `DataSourcePartitioning` used to be in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2`. This moves it into package `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.physical` and renames it to `KeyGroupedPartitioning`, so that it can be extended for more non-V2 use cases, such as Hive bucketing. In addition, it is also changed to accommodate the Storage-Partitioned Join feature.\r\n- a new expression type: `TransformExpression`, is introduced to bind syntactic partition transforms with their semantic meaning, represented by a V2 function. This expression is un-evaluable for now, and is used later in `EnsureRequirements` to check whether join children are compatible with each other.\r\n- a new optimizer rule: `V2ScanPartitioning`, is added to recognize `Scan`s implement `SupportsReportPartitioning`. If they do, this rule converts V2 partition transform expressions into their counterparts in catalyst, and annotate `DataSourceV2ScanRelation` with the result. These are later propagated into `DataSourceV2ScanExecBase`.\r\n- changes are made in `DataSourceV2ScanExecBase` to create `KeyGroupedPartitioning` for scan if 1) the scan is annotated with catalyst partition transform expressions, and 2) if all input splits implement `HasPartitionKey`.\r\n- A new config: `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` is introduced to turn on or off the behavior. By default it is false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark currently support bucketing in DataSource V1, but not in V2. This is the first step to support bucket join, and is general form, storage-partitioned join, for V2 data sources. In addition, the work here can potentially used to support Hive bucketing as well. Please check the SPIP for details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the changes, a user can now:\r\n- have V2 data sources to report distribution and ordering to Spark on read path\r\n- Spark will recognize the distribution property and eliminate shuffle in join/aggregate/window, etc, when the source distribution matches the required distribution from these.\r\n- a new config `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` is introduced to turn on/off the above behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new legacy SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.datetimeEncoder.enabled` which allows to switch to the legacy encoders for the types `TimestampType`/`DateType` even if `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` is `true`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. In the case when a datasource connector doesn't support Java 8 date/timestamp types in rows but has to enable Java 8 types via the SQL config `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` (for instance, the Thrift server set it forcibly), the new config allows to avoid the exception from table scans:\r\n```\r\nSparkExecuteStatementOperation: Error executing query with ac61b10a-486e-463b-8726-3b61da58582e, currentState RUNNING,  \r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 2.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.3 in stage 2.0 (TID 8) (10.157.1.194 executor 0): java.lang.RuntimeException: Error while encoding: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.Timestamp is not a valid external type for schema of timestamp  \r\nif (assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]).isNullAt) null else staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtils$, TimestampType, instantToMicros, validateexternaltype(getexternalrowfield(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]), 0, loan_perf_date), TimestampType), true, false) AS loan_perf_date#1125  \r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoder$Serializer.apply(ExpressionEncoder.scala:239)  \r\n```\r\n2. Should improve user experience with Spark SQL, and make the migration on new Spark version easier for the legacy connectors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the behavior is the same as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *RowEncoderSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn 3.2, we unified the representation of dataset view and SQL view, i.e., we wrap both\r\nof them with `View`. This causes a regression that below case works in 3.1 but failed in 3.2\r\n```sql\r\nsql(\"select 1\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"v\")\r\nsql(\"select * from v\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"v\")\r\n-- in 3.1 it works well, and select will output 1\r\n-- in 3.2 it failed with error: \"AnalysisException: Recursive view v detected (cycle: v -> v)\"\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is in 3.1 we actually never did view cyclic check for dataset view. Because they\r\nare wrapped by `SubqueryAlias` instead of `View`\r\nIn this PR, we want to skip the cyclic check if the view is stored as a logical plan.\r\ni.e., `storeAnalyzedPlanForView = true` or view is created by Dataset API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfix regression\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. This pr add a new logical plan visitor named `DistinctKeyVisitor` to find out all the distinct attributes in current logical plan. For example:\r\n   ```scala\r\n   spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE t(a int, b int, c int) using parquet\")\r\n   spark.sql(\"SELECT a, b, a % 10, a AS aliased_a, max(c), sum(b) FROM t GROUP BY a, b\").queryExecution.analyzed.distinctKeys\r\n   ```\r\n   The output is: {a#1, b#2}, {b#2, aliased_a#0}.\r\n\r\n2. Enhance `RemoveRedundantAggregates` to remove the aggregation if it is groupOnly and the child can guarantee distinct. For example:\r\n   ```sql\r\n   set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1; -- avoid PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin\r\n   create table t1 using parquet as select id a, id as b from range(10);\r\n   create table t2 using parquet as select id as a, id as b from range(8);\r\n   select t11.a, t11.b from (select distinct a, b from t1) t11 left semi join t2 on (t11.a = t2.a) group by t11.a, t11.b;\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Before this PR:\r\n   ```\r\n   == Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\n   Aggregate [a#6L, b#7L], [a#6L, b#7L], Statistics(sizeInBytes=1492.0 B)\r\n   +- Join LeftSemi, (a#6L = a#8L),

Then when reading those `parquet`, `delta` files again, it will actually break the code, because it wrongly thinks user data schema`_metadata` is a hidden file source metadata column. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// prepare a file source df\r\ndf.select(\"*\", \"_metadata\").write.format(\"parquet\").save(path)\r\n\r\nspark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(path).select(\"*\").show()\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes this by cleaning up any remaining metadata information of output columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new
