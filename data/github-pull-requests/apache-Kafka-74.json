`WorkerSinkTask.lastCommittedOffsets` field is now added to (via `Map::putAll`) after a successful offset commit, instead of being completely overwritten. In order to prevent this collection from growing indefinitely, elements are removed from it after topic partitions are revoked from the task's consumer.\r\n\r\nTwo test cases are added to `WorkerSinkTaskTest`:\r\n\r\n- A basic test to verify the \"rewind for redelivery\" behavior when a task throws an exception from `SinkTask::preCommit`; surprisingly, no existing test cases appear to cover this scenario\r\n- A more sophisticated test to verify this same behavior, but with a few rounds of cooperative consumer rebalancing beforehand that expose a bug in the current logic for the `WorkerSinkTask` class\r\n\r\nThe `VerifiableSinkTask` class is also updated to only flush the requested topic partitions in its `flush` method. This is technically unrelated to the issue addressed by this PR and can be moved to a separate PR if necessary; including it here as the original context for identifying this bug was debugging failed system tests and the logic in this part of the tests was originally suspected as a cause of the test failure.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

committing source task offsets without blocking on the delivery of all in-flight records is beneficial most of the time, it can lead to duplicate record delivery if there are in-flight records at the time of the task's end-of-life offset commit.\r\n\r\nA best-effort attempt is made here to wait for any such in-flight records to be delivered before proceeding with the end-of-life offset commit for source tasks. Connect will block for up to `offset.flush.timeout.ms` milliseconds before calculating the latest committable offsets for the task and flushing those to the persistent offset store.\r\n\r\n###

Note this PR is copied from #9492 where I mistakenly did a rebase on a very old change which added thousands of commits, so this is a second attempt to get a very clean PR for this change instead. \r\n\r\nI have made an update to **TimestampConverter** Connect transform to address the main issues that I logged in [KAFKA-10627](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10627).\r\n\r\nNamely, that it now ...\r\n\r\n- supports multiple fields via a new configuration parameter `fields` as a comma-separated list of field names. The old parameter `field` is still supported for compatibility but the value is moved to the new parameter.\r\n- supports a DateTimeFormatter-compatible pattern string that can support multiple timestamp formats for parsing input of string values to whatever target you configure (e.g. parsing strings to Timestamp type).\r\n   - `format` config is now split into two: `format.input` and `format.output` but you can still just send `format` by itself if you do not need to use a more complicated input pattern. When providing only `format`, the string pattern which you provide will be used for both `format.input` and `format.output`.\r\n\r\nI realized that kafka is using `java.util.Date` everywhere and as part of its core types (including in Schemas, values, etc).  In theory it would be good over time to upgrade to `java.time` classes but on first reflection it seems like quite a big overhaul to do this.\r\n\r\nSo instead I focused on the specific problem at hand: parsing strings into `Date` where the strings can come in different formats.  So for this part alone I changed to use `DateTimeFormatter` so we can use multiple patterns to match input strings and convert them to a `java.util.Date` after.\r\n\r\nI also updated some of the way the Config parameters and values work, to bring in line with the other classes and similar to what I did with #9470.\r\n\r\n#### String Input and Output Timestamp Format updates\r\n\r\nBecause now for input formats we allow multiple different possibilities using pattern matching, this does not work for the output format of a Timestamp to a String (which was another possibility of this transform).  So I have changed the configuration a bit... now there are three parameters:\r\n\r\n- `format` which is the original one. You can still use this one, and it will set both input (parsing) and output (Date/Timestamp to string format) based on this format.\r\n- `format.input` is a new parameter, where you can specify a DateTimeFormatter-compatible pattern string that supports multiple different formats in case you have a mix in your data.  For just one example, now you can use something like this as `format.input` and it will catch a lot of different variations which you might see in one timestamp field: `\"[yyyy-MM-dd[['T'][ ]HH:mm:ss[.SSSSSSSz][.SSS[XXX][X]]]]\"`\r\n- `format.output` is a new parameter which only controls the output of a Date/Timestamp to target type of `string`. This is the same as before and still uses `SimpleDateFormat` to create the output string, it is just controlled in a separate parameter now.\r\n\r\nI also added some code which checks the value of each of these three.  Basically it forces you to use either `format`, or one or both of the new parameters -- you cannot mix the old and new together.  In the end, `format.input` and `format.output` are the ones used in the rest of the logic, but the code first compares `format` against these values and sets the value for both of the new parameters depending on what was sent in the config.\r\n\r\n#### Support for multiple fields instead of one single field\r\n\r\nI changed the `field` parameter to now be called `fields` and supports multiple values as a comma-separated list.  I used this new `ConfigUtils.translateDeprecatedConfigs` method to provide automatic translation of of the old parameter to the new one as well.\r\n\r\nWith this change I also updated the `apply` methods so that they loop through each field and check against the list of `fields`.  Now you can specify a comma-separated list of multiple fields to have the same input format/output type applied.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added for both new updates (string formatting and multiple field support).\r\n\r\nAs I looked at this one then I realized that maybe it would be good to add `recursive` support similar to what I have done in #9470 but I guess that can come at another day!\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including

patch for [KAFKA-13468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13468)\r\n\r\nP.S. We found and described this issue in Kafka 2.8.0. We confirmed that this issue holds from Kafka version 2.8.0 to 3.0.0, but currently in the trunk branch, `core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala` is renamed to `core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/UnifiedLog.scala` and there are some small code changes. However, this issue still holds, so we are still submitting the pull request for the fix for the trunk branch (the fix is slightly different from the fix in 2.8.0). And we also propose that the fix should be also applied to version 2.8.0 and 3.0.0, etc, with another pull request.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that currently we just catch the IOException and throw a new KafkaStorageException. But we are thinking whether we should also use `logDirFailureChannel.maybeAddOfflineLogDir` to handle the IOException, such as https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ebb1d6e21cc9213071ee1c6a15ec3411fc215b81/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/checkpoints/CheckpointFile.scala#L92-L120 and https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ebb1d6e21cc9213071ee1c6a15ec3411fc215b81/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/checkpoints/CheckpointFile.scala#L126-L139\r\nIf so, `logDirFailureChannel.maybeAddOfflineLogDir` would crash the node according to the protocol in https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ebb1d6e21cc9213071ee1c6a15ec3411fc215b81/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L268-L277 and

part of the consistency work, state stores (RocksDB* and ChangeLogging*) have a consistency vector that contains the latest seen offset of every partition. We need this information on StandBy servers as well. To achieve this, we persist the offset in the headers of each record that is written to the changelog topic. This way, Standby servers can re-create the consistency vector during restoration.\r\n\r\nNote, that we change the schema of the changelog records to include headers. If consistency is not enabled, the headers contain the version information for the record format.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of tests: integration test that checks that the offsets are written to the changelog and restored at the standby,  unit tests that tests restoration and unit test that tests writing to changelog.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

types of exceptions that the producer reports are encountered synchronously during a call to `KafkaProducer::send`, but reported asynchronously via the resulting `Future` instead of being thrown directly from the call to `send`. One common example of this is when the size of a record exceeds the client-side `max.message.bytes` configuration property; when that happens, a failed future is returned immediately from `KafkaProducer::send`.\r\n\r\nThis is all fine, but the current behavior does not take into account the guarantees surrounding the transactional producer's `commitTransaction` method, which are that:\r\n> ...if any of the `send(ProducerRecord)` calls which were part of the transaction hit irrecoverable errors, this method will throw the last received exception immediately and the transaction will not be committed. So all `send(ProducerRecord)` calls in a transaction must succeed in order for this method to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR cause producers to fail on `commitTransaction` if any prior calls to `send` resulted in one of these aynchronously-reported, synchronously-encountered exceptions.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach could be to throw these exceptions directly to the caller in `send`, but that would alter producer behavior for all users instead of just ones using transactional producers; that tradeoff seems less desirable just to fix an issue that only affects transactional producers.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added that cover a variety of cases that may lead to previously-missed exceptions and verify that they cause `KafkaProducer::commitTransaction` to fail as expected.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-16T21:24:02Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T16:26:33Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T10:51:11Z","merged_at":"2022-01-26T10:51:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"000ba031c3d1135cb0e1fe6438d1e464ff10b6b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/665460155621bbda8cbab09208974fc33df210f0","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-9279","ref":"kafka-9279","sha":"665460155621bbda8cbab09208974fc33df210f0","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch tightens the configuration checks related to KRaft configs by adding the following constraints:\r\n\r\n* `control.plane.listener.name` is confirmed to be empty in KRaft mode whenever a config object is created as opposed to later when the broker is given the config and tries to start.\r\n* `controller.listener.names` is required to be empty for the non-KRaft (i.e. ZooKeeper) case.  A ZooKeeper-based cluster that sets this config will fail to restart until this config is removed.\r\n* There must be no advertised listeners when running just a KRaft controller (i.e. when `process.roles=controller`).  This means neither `listeners` nor `advertised.listeners` (if the latter is explicitly defined) can contain a listener that does not also appear in `controller.listener.names`.\r\n* When running a KRaft broker (i.e. when `process.roles=broker` or `process.roles=broker,controller`), advertised listeners (which was already checked to be non-empty via the check that the inter-broker listener appear there) must not include any listeners appearing in `controller.listener.names`.\r\n* When running a KRaft controller (i.e. when `process.roles=controller` or `process.roles=broker,controller`) `controller.listener.names` must be non-empty and every one must appear in `listeners`\r\n* When running just a KRaft broker (i.e. when `process.roles=broker`) `controller.listener.names` must be non-empty and none of them can appear in `listeners`.  This was indirectly checked previously, but the indirect checks did not catch all cases.\r\n* When running just a KRaft broker we log a warning if more than one entry appears in `controller.listener.names` because only the first entry is used.\r\n\r\nWe also map the `CONTROLLER` listener name to the `PLAINTEXT` security protocol by default when using KRaft as a convenience.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds appropriate unit tests.  I have manually confirmed that our KRaft Quickstart config files in `config/kraft` remain valid (both for the combined and separate cases).  I also confirmed that KRaft system test configs remain valid (see sanity check test output below).\r\n\r\n```\r\n================================================================================\r\nSESSION REPORT (ALL TESTS)\r\nducktape version: 0.8.1\r\nsession_id:

test was disabled in https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/af8100b94fda4a27511797233e9845078ae8a69f. The reason the test was failing is that it assumes that the reference to `servers` can be mutated directly. The implementation in `IntegrationTestHarness` is intended to allow this by returning a mutable buffer, but the implementation actually returns a copy of the underlying collection. This caused the test case to create multiple `KafkaServer` instances instead of one as intended because it was modifying the copy. This led to the broker registration failure.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

`sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.retry.backoff.ms` and `sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.retry.backoff.max.ms` configuration options were added to the `SaslConfig` class but their default values were not added to `KafkaConfig`. As a result, when the OAuth validation feature is enabled in the broker and those two configuration values aren't explicitly provided by the user, the broker exits.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to define them in the `KafkaConfig` class.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

DO NOT MERGE Awaiting discussion and acceptance of [KIP-799](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-799%3A+Align+behaviour+for+producer+callbacks+with+documented+behaviour) first\r\n\r\nOriginally, Callback would return a null metadata value when an error occurred.\r\n\r\nThis was partially changed by [KAFKA-3303](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3303), where in some cases Callback would return an 'empty' metadata. In this empty metadata TopicPartition is set correctly but all other fields are set as `-1`.\r\n\r\nThe docs were later updated by [KAFKA-7412](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7412), but it incorrectly states that Callback will always return this 'empty' metadata when an error occurs. However in the case of any exceptions that are a subclass of ApiException, Callback will still return a null value (see [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3.1/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.java#L1002)).\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the behaviour when an ApiException is thrown, to align that behaviour with other exceptions and with the currently documented behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- In the one case where KafkaProducer was calling Callback.onCompletion directly, update the call to pass a placeholder value for metadata (in a manner consistent with the Javadoc) instead of a null value. Add unit tests around this change.\r\n- Move the private nested InterceptorCallback class out of KafkaProducer, and create a dedicated public class for InterceptorCallback within 'clients.producer.internal' instead.\r\n- Where KafkaProducer was passing InterceptorCallback to methods within 'clients.producer.internal' classes, update those methods to expect InterceptorCallback as input instead of Callback.

the validation so that we accept duplicate listeners on the same port but if and only if the listeners are valid IP addresses with one address being an IPv4 address and the other being an IPv6 address. The detection of whether an address is a valid IP/IPv4/IPv6 address is done using Apache's commons-validator. Outside of this specific case the validations are kept the same albeit error messages have been updated to reflect that there is this new exception case of accepting IPv4/IPv6 on the same port.\r\n\r\nThis PR tests different corner cases by checking whether the changed `listenerListToEndPoints` either throws an exception (and its message or not). The test follows the exact same pattern as the `testDuplicateListeners` test. Locally on my machine the PR passes both `testIPv4AndIPv6SamePortListeners` (the new test) and `testDuplicateListeners` pass but I will wait for CI to finish.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

would return an 'empty' metadata. In this empty metadata TopicPartition is set correctly but all other fields are set as `-1`.\r\n\r\nThe docs were later updated by [KAFKA-7412](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7412), but it incorrectly states that Callback will always return this 'empty' metadata when an error occurs. However in the case of any exceptions that are a subclass of ApiException, Callback will still return a null value (see [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3.1/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.java#L1002)).\r\n\r\nThis change aims to clarify the docs to accurately reflect

is common in our code base to have unit tests which must be run for all the versions of a given request. Most of the time, we do so by iterating over all the versions in the test itself which is error prone.\r\n\r\nWith JUnit5 and ParameterizedTest, we can now use a custom arguments source for this case, which is way more convenient. It looks likes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n@ApiKeyVersionsSource(apiKey = ApiKeys.ADD_PARTITIONS_TO_TXN)\r\npublic void mytest(short version) {\r\n  // do smth based on version...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces the new annotation and updates `AddPartitionsToTxnRequestTest` test as a first example. I will migrate all the other cases in subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

a nice mock in `RocksDBMetricsRecorderTest#shouldCorrectlyHandleHitRatioRecordingsWithZeroHitsAndMisses()` and `RocksDBMetricsRecorderTest#shouldCorrectlyHandleAvgRecordingsWithZeroSumAndCount()` were green although `getTickerCount()` was never called. The tests were green because EasyMock returns 0 for a numerical return value by default if no expectation is specified. Thus, commenting out the expectation for `getTickerCount()` did not change the result of the test.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the mock to a default mock and fixes the expectation to expect `getAndResetTickerCount()`. Now, commenting out the expectation leads to a test failure.\r\n \r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

KAFKA-13102, we added topic IDs to the InitialFetchState and the PartitionFetchState in order to send fetch requests using topic IDs when ibp is 3.1. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are some cases where we could initially send topic IDs from the controller and then no longer to do so (controller changes to an IBP < 2.8). If we do not remove from the PartitionFetchState and one broker is still IBP 3.1, it will try to send a version 13 fetch request to brokers that no longer have topic IDs in the metadata cache. This could leave the cluster in a state unable to fetch from these partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the topic IDs from the PartitionFetchState if the log contains a topic ID but the request does not. This means that we will always handle a leader and isr request if there is no ID in the request but an ID in the log. \r\nSuch a state should be transient because we are either \r\n* upgrading the cluster and somehow switched between a new IBP controller and an old one --> and will eventually have all new IBP controllers/brokers.\r\n* downgrading the cluster --> will eventually have all old IBP controllers/brokers and will restart the broker/delete the partition metadata file for them. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

However, the producer will continue retrying the `InitProducerId` request in the background. If it happens to return before the user retry of `initTransactions`, then the producer will raise an exception about an invalid state transition. \r\n\r\nThe patch fixes the issue by checking both the

This PR will reset generation ID when `ILLEGAL_GENERATION` error since the member ID is still valid.\r\n\r\n=====\r\n`resetStateAndRejoin` when `REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS` error in sync group, to avoid out-of-date `ownedPartition`\r\n\r\n== JIRA description ==\r\nIn KAFKA-13406, we found there's user got stuck when in rebalancing with cooperative sticky assignor. The reason is the \"ownedPartition\" is out-of-date, and it failed the cooperative assignment validation.\r\n\r\nInvestigate deeper, I found the root cause is we didn't reset generation and state after sync group fail. In KAFKA-12983, we fixed the issue that the onJoinPrepare is not called in resetStateAndRejoin method. And it causes the ownedPartition not get cleared. But there's another case that the ownedPartition will be out-of-date. Here's the example:\r\n\r\n  1. consumer A joined and synced group successfully with generation 1\r\n  2. New rebalance started with generation 2, consumer A joined successfully, but somehow, consumer A doesn't send out sync group immediately\r\n  3.  other consumer completed sync group successfully in generation 2, except consumer A.\r\n  4.  After consumer A send out sync group, the new rebalance start, with generation 3. So consumer A got REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS error with sync group response\r\n  5.  When receiving REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS, we re-join the group, with generation 3, with the assignment (ownedPartition) in generation 1.\r\n  6.  So, now, we have out-of-date ownedPartition sent, with unexpected results happened\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe might want to do resetStateAndRejoin when RebalanceInProgressException errors happend in sync group. Because when we got sync group error, it means, join group passed, and other consumers (and the leader) might already completed this round of rebalance. The assignment distribution this consumer have is already out-of-date.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

patch fixes a bug in `DynamicBrokerConfig` which causes some configuration changes to be ignored. In particular, the bug is the result of the reference to the old configuration getting indirectly mutated prior to the call to `BrokerReconfigurable.reconfigure`. This causes the first dynamic configuration update to pass effectively the same configuration as both `oldConfig` and `newConfig`. In cases such as in `DynamicThreadPool`, the update is ignored because the old configuration value matches the new configuration value.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

This patch is WIP. Its purpose is to demonstrate a chosen approach and get feedback from committers.a \r\n\r\n### Summary \r\n\r\nThis patch solves [KAFKA-13024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13024) and[ KAFKA-13183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13183) by introducing a concept of `decorator nodes` in the topology. The idea behind decorator nodes is similar to a decorator pattern - to extract common added behaviour from different entities. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this patch introduces 2 decorator nodes - `DropNullKeyNode` and `DropNullKeyValueNode`. These nodes have a single method `decorate` that accepts a `ProcessorSupplier` and returns another `ProcessorSupplier` that filters `null` keys/key-values respectively. Besides fixing 2 issues mentioned above (dropping `null` keys on repartition, missing metrics), there are 2 advantages to this approach:\r\n* It reduces code duplication around `if (record.key() == null...`. \r\n* As @mjsax suggested in [this comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13024?focusedCommentId=17427868&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17427868), It optimizes away duplicated null-key/value processing from the topology.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\n\r\nThe decorators are set by nodes according to a new parameter in processor parameters:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b4c3adc3ce3f40ad96400b94379fa206d782922f/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/internals/graph/ProcessorParameters.java#L45-L52\r\n\r\nCurrently ± working example is `StatefulProcessorNode` where the original processor supplier is decorated: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b4c3adc3ce3f40ad96400b94379fa206d782922f/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/internals/graph/StatefulProcessorNode.java#L85-L92\r\n\r\nDecorators are added to the topology together with the decorating node:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b4c3adc3ce3f40ad96400b94379fa206d782922f/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/internals/InternalStreamsBuilder.java#L229-L240\r\n\r\nThen, `InternalStreamsBuilder#buildAndOptimizeTopology` removes duplicating downstream decorators and attaches the remaining ones to the decorated nodes. The decorator nodes are not present in the final topology.\r\n\r\nAdded tests in `InternalStreamBuilderTest` and `KStreamRepartitionIntegrationTest.java` describe how the decorator operations are done. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following description reflects the first take at this issue and is left here only for completeness.\r\n\r\n~Right now, the `repartition` operator always filters out `null` keys. This behavior is not correct and is a regression compared to the deprecated `through` operator.~\r\n\r\n~This patch fixes the issue by filtering `null` keys only for optimizable repartition nodes. First, it removes unnecessary processor node from the topology for `UnoptimizableRepartitionNode`. Second, it only adds the filtering processor only if the node is optimizable. I introduced an `isOptimizable` boolean method for repartition nodes to make this property more obvious in the code.~\r\n\r\n~To verify that change, I added a new test to the repartition integration suite that produces pairs with `null` keys and expects them to be present after the repartition.~\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and
