Instead, `AppenderatorDriver` (and thus `Appenderator` APIs are called by the same thread. See `publishAndRegisterHandoff()`.\r\n\r\nI additionally removed some unnecessary or unused variables.\r\n\r\n- Removed `pauseAfterRead` from `KafkaIOConfig` because it was always `false`.\r\n- Removed `pauseMillis` from `IncrementalIndexingKafkaTaskRunner` and `timeout` parameter from the `pause()` api. Those two variables are designed only for `pauseAfterRead`. Since that parameter is not used, `pauseMillis` was always `PAUSE_FOREVER` and `timeout` was always 0.\r\n- Removed `resume` parameter from `setEndoffsets()` api. This parameter was also used only for `pauseAfterRead` and always `true`.\r\n\r\nAlso, `setOffsets()` API now returns `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` on failure.\r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start

PR optimizes FilteredAggregators with IntervalFilters for per-segment queries on historicals.\r\n\r\nThe optimization compares the segment interval to the filtering interval in the FilteredAggregator. \r\n* If the filtering interval completely covers the segment interval, then the filter will match everything in the segment and can be removed.\r\n* If the filtering interval covers nothing in the segment interval, then the filter will reject everything and aggregation calls on the filtered agg can be no-ops.\r\n* If the filtering interval partially covers the segment interval, then the filtering interval is clipped to the boundaries of the segment interval. This can result in better cache hit rates, since the filtering interval in the aggregator is part of the query cache key. This helps in cases where a user issues a sequence of identical queries with filtered aggs but with changes to the filtering interval, where for some segments the filtering interval's coverage of a segment interval will not change, and so previous cache results can be used.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes a benchmark (TimeCompareBenchmark) that runs timeseries and TopN \"time compare\" queries (comparing metrics between two time periods), similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\": \"timeseries\",\r\n  \"dataSource\": \"wikiticker-v2\",\r\n  \"intervals\": [\r\n    \"2018-04-15T00:00Z/2018-04-28T00:00Z\",\r\n    \"2018-04-01T00:00Z/2018-04-14T00:00Z\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"granularity\": \"all\",\r\n  \"context\": {\r\n    \"enableSegmentOptimize\": true,\r\n    \"timeout\": 40000,\r\n    \"useCache\": false,\r\n    \"populateCache\": false\r\n  },\r\n  \"aggregations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"filtered\",\r\n      \"name\": \"sum_added\",\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"interval\",\r\n        \"dimension\": \"__time\",\r\n        \"intervals\": [\r\n          \"2018-04-15T00:00Z/2018-04-28T00:00Z\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggregator\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"sum_added\",\r\n        \"type\": \"doubleSum\",\r\n        \"fieldName\": \"added\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"filtered\",\r\n      \"name\": \"_cmp_sum_added\",\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"interval\",\r\n        \"dimension\": \"__time\",\r\n        \"intervals\": [\r\n          \"2018-04-01T00:00Z/2018-04-14T00:00Z\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggregator\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"_cmp_sum_added\",\r\n        \"type\": \"doubleSum\",\r\n        \"fieldName\": \"added\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benchmark creates 10 segments, and runs queries that have two filtered aggs. One of the filtered aggs covers all of the segments in the first half of the interval and matches nothing in the second half. The other filtered agg matches nothing in the first half and matches everything in the second half:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRecent interval:

https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/5771.\r\n\r\nAdded `KafkaIndexTaskRunner` and its two implementations for the legacy and the recent one. Please note that the goal of this PR is to make the non-legacy code of `KafkaIndexTask` more understandable. There ARE a bunch of code duplication, but I think this is better than refactoring including a good abstraction.\r\n\r\n- `LegacyKafkaIndexTaskRunner` is simply a copy of `KafkaIndexTask.runInternalLegacy()` and required variables. `LegacyKafkaIndexTaskRunner` is expected to be removed in the future, so there is no need to put effort to make the code structure better. Also, it's easier to remove the legacy code in the future.\r\n- There are already a bunch of code duplication in `KafkaIndexTask` between the legacy mode and the incremental publishing mode. A good abstraction between them requires rewriting lots of codes.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change isâ€‚[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

#5761.\r\n\r\nMajor changes are:\r\n\r\n- Enforce to have at most a single active segment per sequence and per interval (see `SegmentsOfInterval`)\r\n- Fix `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator.allocatePendingSegment()` to respect `skipSegmentLineageCheck` to avoid the unique constraint violation for `sequence_name_prev_id_sha1`. If `skipSegmentLineageCheck` is true, `sequence_prev_id` is always an empty string and `sequence_name_prev_id_sha1` is created as below.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final String sequenceNamePrevIdSha1 =

is an initial version of #5700 fix. Works as expected, rich request logs are emitted to dedicated kafka topic as complex JSON structure. But the overall design of the solution is ugly, kafka emitter needs to know too many details about emitted events to serialize them correctly. \r\n\r\nFor ServiceMetricEvent and AlertEvents kafka emitter serializes map like structure of the event. But for ReqestLogEvent it does not work due to complex query and queryStats fields. So for the complex object like RequestLogEvent Jakson databind is used for serialization instead of Event.toMap method. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion emitters should depend fully on Jakson databind for serialization instead of Event.toMap method. But it requires changes in ServiceMetricEvent and AlertEvents and I'm not sure about impact on another emitter implementations.\r\n\r\n@dkhwangbo, @jihoonson What do you think?

time a segment is \"add\"ed to a timeline, \"isComplete\" is called on the holder that it is added to. \"isComplete\" is an O(segments per chunk) operation, meaning that adding N segments to a chunk

adds an audit log whenever it is submitted if the action should be audited. Here is the code snippet.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n      try {\r\n        final long auditLogStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n        storage.addAuditLog(task, taskAction);\r\n        emitTimerMetric(\"task/action/log/time\", System.currentTimeMillis() - auditLogStartTime);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `addAuditLog()` method internally inserts the byte-serialized taskAction to the metastore.\r\n\r\nThis can make actions failed if they are too large. One of the example of such large actions can be found in batch ingestion: if input data is very large, there can be a lot of segments to be published. HadoopIndexTask currently workarounds this issue by publishing segments per interval like below, but this is a temporal solution and there should be the same issue if there are too many segments per interval.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public void publishSegments(Iterable<DataSegment> segments) throws IOException\r\n  {\r\n    // Request segment pushes for each set\r\n    final Multimap<Interval, DataSegment> segmentMultimap = Multimaps.index(\r\n        segments,\r\n        new Function<DataSegment, Interval>()\r\n        {\r\n          @Override\r\n          public Interval apply(DataSegment segment)\r\n          {\r\n            return segment.getInterval();\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    );\r\n    for (final Collection<DataSegment> segmentCollection : segmentMultimap.asMap().values()) {\r\n      getTaskActionClient().submit(new SegmentInsertAction(ImmutableSet.copyOf(segmentCollection)));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to allow multiple rows for the same action, so that we can avoid such failures.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change isâ€‚[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\"

configured via the \"movingAverageWindowSizeMillis\" and \"movingAverageNumWindows\" properties in the tuning configs for these tasks. By default these are 1000 and 60 (record the current stats every 1s, and store 60 of these records).\r\n\r\nFor Kafka indexing, the supervisor also provides an endpoint at

 @b-slim  Currently Druid supports only single dimension partitioning. This PR extends that and allows for multiple dimension partitioning.\r\n\r\nA new MultipleDimensionShardSpec has been introduced. The current DeterminePartitionsJob has been modified to use MultipleDimensionShardSpec.\r\nAlso to effectively return domain, the MultipleDimensionShardSpec keeps track of Max/Min for every dimension.\r\n\r\nWe have seen MultipleDimension partitioning to be extremely helpful when queries are always filtered on a particular set of dimensions - There are far lesser segments to scan.

Kerberos Spnego Auth Router Issue.\r\nCurrent state of the Kerberos Auth module is broken if Router routes the query to a Broker on a different physical host.\r\nWhy?: During the Spnego Auth negotiation the ticket obtained to access the target service is tight to the hostname of the service in question. \r\nThis where for instance the Druid internal Http Client generates the challenge token \r\n```io.druid.security.kerberos.DruidKerberosUtil#kerberosChallenge``` as you can see it is hostname based.\r\nThus the Broker will not be able to decrypt such token and throw

shared secret ```druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret``` and tight the the original client Principal/Hostname thus no escalation of privilege at all.\r\nI don't think Basic Auth module needs such hook since the credentials are not tight to hostnames thus no change needed\r\n\r\nMore information about discussion can be found
