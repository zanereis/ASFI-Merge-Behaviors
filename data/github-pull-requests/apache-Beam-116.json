`ListDocuments`\r\n* `BatchGetDocuments`\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n\r\nNo external dependencies are needed for this suite\r\n\r\nA large suite of unit tests have been added to cover most branches and error\r\nscenarios in the various components. Test for input validation and bounds\r\nchecking are also included in this suite.\r\n\r\n### Integration Tests\r\n\r\nIntegration tests for each type of RPC is present in\r\n`org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.firestore.it.FirestoreV1IT`. All of these tests\r\nleverage `TestPipeline` and verify the expected Documents/Collections are all\r\noperated on during the test.\r\n\r\n### Reviewers\r\nR: @chamikaramj\r\nR: @jlara310 (Firestore Technical Writer)\r\nR: @cynthiachi (Firestore Dataplane)\r\nR: @danthev (Firestore SRE)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

when ProtoSchemaTranslator creates the beam schema from a protobuf definition it always puts the Oneofs at the start of the beam schema due to oneofs always being created first.  This means that the order of the fields doesn't match the order of the protobuf definition. As the schema generation is used when converting from beam rows to protobufs, it additionally means that it is impossible to convert from a beam row where the oneof fields are not the first fields in the beamrow.\r\n\r\nThis change orders the resultant beam schema to match the order in the protobuf definition. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR updates the test protos so that the beam schema in the oneof tests matches the protobuf definition, as opposed to the beam row having the Oneofs first. \r\n\r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

kw args of process function are declared before DnFnParam placeholders the fulfillment will shift to wrong index unexpectedly. \r\n\r\nFor example if process has signature\r\n```\r\ndef process(element, an_arg='x', w=DoFn.WindowParam):\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nat runtime the window param will be mapped onto 'an_arg' instead of w, and w will not be replaced with runtime value, causing confusing behaviors. (e.g. an_arg will be an instance of GlobalWindow or FixedWindow but w is still DoFn.WindowParam).\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents unexpected ArgPlaceholder fulfillment shift.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds a simple implementation for `tz_convert` and tests. Unfortunately testing it exposed https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/41817, where `pd.util.hash_array` (used for partitioning) fails on `DatetimeIndex` instances with a tz specified. Note this is a bug in Beam code, `hash_array` is only intended to operate on numpy arrays or pandas ExtensionArrays. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue in Beam - we now convert index values to a numpy array with `np.asarray` before passing to `hash_array`.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n

Features:\r\n1. This PR creates an interface inside Samza Beam Runner to get I/O information for a Samza Beam job.\r\n2. It also adds a PipelineJsonRenderer which renders the Beam DAG in JSON form.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\n1. The SamzaIOInfo interface can be implemented to emit I/O information of a Samza job. This is used by the PipelineJsonRenderer to add I/O information to the Beam DAG. \r\n2. The JSON renderer helps emit the Beam DAG in JSON form as a config.\r\n\r\nThese changes can be used in the visualization of the Beam pipeline. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

that this implementation makes the default value `sort=False`, since we cannot guarantee the order that's imposed will be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes a new (non-pandas) method called `length()`. This is intended as an altenative for `__len__()` that produces a `DeferredScalar`. It's helpful because the result can be used in arithmetic with `DeferredFrame` instances, which is done in the `value_counts(normalize=True)` implementation.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status
