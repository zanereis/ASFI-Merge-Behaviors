pr enables large tensor shape inference for Python custom ops.\r\n\r\nSo I basically just changed the shape inference c api with which c++ calls into python from using int to using int64_t. This means all custom op shape inference will use int64_t. \r\n\r\nOf course what we can also do is to have two c apis `CustomOpInferShapeFunc` and `CustomOpInferShapeFunc64` and have two corresponding python callbacks `infer_shape_entry` and `infer_shape_entry64`. This way we can branch on the c++ side to either depending on if large tensor is enabled or not. This can help performance by a tiny tiny bit but I think it might not outweigh the complexity so I did not do it this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal run:\r\n```\r\nubuntu@ip-172-31-38-169:~/myspace$ pytest  tests/nightly/test_large_array.py::test_custom_op_large_tensor\r\n============================================ test session starts =============================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.7.7, pytest-5.4.1, py-1.8.1, pluggy-0.13.1\r\nrootdir: /home/ubuntu/myspace\r\nplugins: remotedata-0.3.2, openfiles-0.4.0, astropy-header-0.1.2, hypothesis-5.8.3, arraydiff-0.3, doctestplus-0.5.0\r\ncollected 1 item                                                                                             \r\n\r\ntests/nightly/test_large_array.py .

Description ##\r\n`symbol.optimize_for` backend options are given as kwargs but the `block.optimize_for` ones are given as a separate `backend_opts` dict.\r\n\r\nWe end up with an API discrepancy, than can be confusing for the user. Here's an exemple:\r\n\r\n#### Symbol\r\n\r\n```\r\nsym.optimize_for(backend, args, reqArgs=True, dedup_subgraph=True)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Block (Gluon)\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"addInputPass\", clear=False, backend_opts={'dedup_subgraph':True})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis limitation was due to preserve the kwargs from hybridize.\r\nHowever this kwargs is virtually only used to forward the `static_alloc` and `static_shape` arguments.\r\n\r\n## Change\r\n\r\nThis PR factors out `static_alloc` and `static_shape` and changes the `kwargs`, in both `optimize_for` and `hybridize`.\r\n\r\n### Example after the change:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"addInputPass\", clear=False, backend_opts={'dedup_subgraph':True})\r\n```\r\nwill be now called as \r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"addInputPass\", clear=False, dedup_subgraph=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: if needed in the future, we can add an `extra_hybridize_kwargs`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-20T03:46:26Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T17:53:32Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T17:53:32Z","merged_at":"2020-11-16T17:53:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0710e2a010edf0c9b3a28c71ec5b8f15e02937a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nStarting with CUDA 11.1 it is possible to run programs compiled with newer CUDA toolkit with older driver (as long as the major version is the same, e.g. CUDA 11.1 works with CUDA 11.0 driver) without the compat library. This requires a few changes to API used by nvRTC however, which are addressed by this PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Change was tested in internal CI using CUDA 11.1 toolkit and Titan RTX with 450.80.02 driver.","created_at":"2020-10-16T22:41:12Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T19:31:04Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T19:31:04Z","merged_at":"2020-11-03T19:31:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b33fbd1ad185e26bd5b0ba0621932fb8a069a840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nIn the current version of KLDivLoss, the return value is not the same value calculated by SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss, which is not documented. It may due to the incorrect settings which using mean rather than sum dealing with the return value.\r\nI provide a fix of this setting, which will keep the return value of `KLDivLoss` and `SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss` almost the same when `from_logits=False` and `sparse_label=False` are set to these functions seperately.\r\nNow, the behave of KLDivLoss is exactly the same to what the document say.\r\n\r\nto reproduce the misbehave in the current master branch:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\na=mx.nd.array([[-1,1],[1,-1]])\r\nb=mx.nd.array([1,0]).one_hot(2)\r\nTrueLoss=mx.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss(sparse_label=False)\r\nFalseLoss=mx.gluon.loss.KLDivLoss(from_logits=False)\r\nc=TrueLoss(a,b)\r\nd=FalseLoss(a,b)*a.shape[-1]\r\nassert((c-d).abs().sum()==0

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Now, the behave of KLDivLoss is exactly the same to what the document say.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nEnable LTS for numpy insert op for 2/3 insert kernels(`insert_scalar` and `insert_slice`). Performance of `insert_tensor` needs to be optimized first before enabling large tensor for it. Currently if the user attempts to use `insert_tensor` the program will give error message that large tensor is not supported for insert_tensor kernel.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n-

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11061.\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19362\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a rewrite of the `mxnet.np.argmax` operator to reuse our axes reduce kernels on both cpu and gpu. Before it was using a mshadow expression implementation. This should work on all the data types. Note that this rewrite can be applied to `np.argmin` as well, but I am keeping the old implementation for `argmin` for now so that we can compare the run time. So the basic idea is to create a new struct `IndexedNum` to store both the number and index of the values in the tensor and use a custom reducer `mshadow_op::argmax` to update both `num` and `idx`.\r\n\r\n```C++\r\ntemplate <typename IType, typename DType>\r\nstruct IndexedNum {\r\n  IType idx;\r\n  DType num;\r\n\r\n  IndexedNum& operator+=(const IndexedNum& rhs){\r\n    return *this;\r\n  }  \r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n/*! \\brief arg max reducer */\r\nstruct argmax {\r\n  /*! \\brief do reduction into dst */\r\n  template<typename AType, typename DType>\r\n  MSHADOW_XINLINE static void Reduce(volatile AType& dst,  volatile DType src) { // NOLINT(*)\r\n    if (dst.num < src.num) {\r\n      dst.num = src.num;\r\n      dst.idx = src.idx;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  }\r\n  /*! \\brief combine the results of two reducers */\r\n  template<typename DType>\r\n  MSHADOW_XINLINE static void Merge(volatile DType& dst_val, volatile DType& src_val) { // NOLINT(*)\r\n    Reduce(dst_val, src_val);\r\n  }\r\n  /*!\r\n   *\\brief set the initial value during reduction\r\n   */\r\n  template<typename DType>\r\n  MSHADOW_XINLINE static void SetInitValue(DType &initv) { // NOLINT(*)\r\n    initv.num = mshadow::red::limits::NegInfValue<decltype(initv.num)>();\r\n    initv.idx = 0;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis brings about a considerable speed improvement on GPU when the dimension of the axis to be reduced is large. Specifically, when dim=30000 the improvement is ~60x; dim=300000 improvement is ~130x; dim=3000000 improvement is ~180x. When the reduced axis has a small dim (e.g 64), the run time is slightly longer (~1.8x) due to the added memory overhead. However this is probably fine as in such cases the magnitude of the run time is very small.\r\n\r\nOn CPU we are sort of seeing the opposite as on GPU: the run time will get significantly improved when the reduced dim (M) is small and the number of the reduced axes (N) is large. This is probably due to the fact that we are adding cpu parallelism on N but not M. I think we should probably parallelize M instead? There should be room to optimize the cpu kernel and this by itself can be another pr of impact as many ops use this reduce kernel (e.g. sum).

The first codeblock shows a normal test function, whereas the second shows a `unittest.TestCase`.\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\n% python3 -m pytest ../tests/python/unittest/test_deferred_compute.py::test_indexing_empty_shape                                                                                                                                     6s ~/src/mxnet-master/build 2020-10/pytest-with-seed-fixture ip-172-31-95-96\r\n============================================================================================================================================== test session starts ===============================================================================================================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.0.2, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1\r\nrootdir: /home/ubuntu/src/mxnet-master, configfile: pytest.ini\r\nplugins: timeout-1.4.2, env-0.6.2\r\ntimeout: 1200.0s\r\ntimeout method: signal\r\ntimeout func_only: False\r\ncollected 1 item\r\n\r\n../tests/python/unittest/test_deferred_compute.py F                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        [100%]\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================== FAILURES ====================================================================================================================================================\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ test_indexing_empty_shape ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n    def test_indexing_empty_shape():\r\n>       raise RuntimeError\r\n        @mx.util.use_np\r\nE       RuntimeError\r\n\r\n../tests/python/unittest/test_deferred_compute.py:581: RuntimeError\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Captured stdout setup ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSetting module np/mx/python random seeds, use MXNET_MODULE_SEED=845205315 to reproduce.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Captured log teardown ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWARNING  root:conftest.py:225 Error seen with seeded test, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=215573059 to reproduce\r\n============================================================================================================================================ short test summary info =============================================================================================================================================\r\nFAILED ../tests/python/unittest/test_deferred_compute.py::test_indexing_empty_shape - RuntimeError\r\n=============================================================================================================================================== 1 failed in 0.21s ================================================================================================================================================\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\n% python3 -m pytest ../tests/python/unittest/test_numpy_contrib_gluon_data_vision.py                      6s ~/src/mxnet-master/build 2020-10/pytest-with-seed-fixture ip-172-31-95-96\r\n================================================================================= test session starts =================================================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.0.2, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1\r\nrootdir: /home/ubuntu/src/mxnet-master, configfile: pytest.ini\r\nplugins: timeout-1.4.2, env-0.6.2\r\ntimeout: 1200.0s\r\ntimeout method: signal\r\ntimeout func_only: False\r\ncollected 3 items\r\n\r\n../tests/python/unittest/test_numpy_contrib_gluon_data_vision.py F..

Description ##\r\nThis fixes issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19255, where it was noted that when a unittest was skipped, the skip-exception caused the with_seed() decorator to log the seed. While the 1.8.x branch uses nosetests, not pytest, the same behavior is seen on 1.8..x. With this PR the seed is no longer logged.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't have any testing added- I will inspect the CI log for skipped tests such as test_operator.py:test_activation to verify that the seed logging has been successfully eliminated.\r\n\r\nThis is identical to the master -> 1.x backport PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19327.\r\n\r\n@leezu @samskalicky\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis fixes issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19255, where it was noted that when a unittest was skipped, the skip-exception caused the with_seed() decorator to log the seed. While the 1.x branch uses nosetests, not pytest, the same behavior is seen on 1.x.  With this PR the seed is no longer logged.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't have any testing added- I will inspect the CI log for skipped tests such as test_operator.py:test_activation to verify that the seed logging has been successfully eliminated.\r\n\r\n@leezu @samskalicky \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL],

Description ##\r\nThis fixes issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19255, where it was noted that when a unittest calls pytest.skip(), the with_seed() decorator considers it a non-successful outcome and logs the seed.  Now no seed is logged.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't have any testing added- I will inspect the CI log for subtest-skipping tests such as test_gluon.py::test_hybrid_static_memory to verify that the unneeded seed logging has been successfully removed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X

Description ##\r\nThis PR includes improvements discovered during the testing of the v1.8.x branch:\r\n\r\n- For the test_tensorrt.py:test_tensorrt_symbol test, the explicitly set tolerances were removed for the 32-bit model test.  This allows the test to pass on A100 by allowing the framework to detect the A100 context and choose the relaxed tolerance appropriate for a TF32 calculation.\r\n- For the test_tensorrt.py:test_tensorrt_symbol_int8 test, logic was inserted to avoid running the test on GPU architectures earlier than Volta (PASCAL, MAXWELL, etc.).  On PASCAL, where int8 is not supported, a message was printed, but then the test hung. \r\n With this PR, the test is skipped.  In general, users should not attempt running TRT int8 on PASCAL GPUs or earlier.\r\n- Finally, a CI failure was seen in test_operator_gpu.py:test_np_mixed_precision_binary_funcs for seed MXNET_TEST_SEED=590323404.  Additional repro'd failures all seemed to occur when the data shape was ().  This behavior was seen and fixed in master PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18660.  This PR includes only the portion of that PR that skips the test when the data shape is ().  The full PR should still be backported by the author to 1.x if deemed useful.\r\n\r\n@yzhliu @Kh4L @samskalicky \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] PR's title starts with a category

is a minor command generation bug with cd pipeline. link: https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/1800/pipeline\r\n\r\nThanks @mseth10 for pointing out the initial direction. Quoting his comments:\r\n```\r\nLooks like this commit caused the failure: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/d81692933f507e7631cbbbb8be920f02eaeaa585\r\n\r\nMore specifically, changes to env_vars in docker_run function in file ci/Jenkinsfile_utils.groovy, which gets called for the CD pipeline here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/7d3e027846b2767e330d488092e0c12b2d01b36d/cd/python/pypi/Jenkins_pipeline.groovy#L52\r\n\r\nThe CD pipeline:\r\nhttps://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/1775/pipeline/331\r\n\r\n- ran this command (faulty) after the commit got merged:\r\n`ci/build.py -e R -e E -e L -e E -e A -e S -e E -e _ -e B -e U -e I -e L -e D -e = -e  -e t -e r -e u -e e -e  --docker-registry mxnetci --nvidiadocker --platform centos7_gpu_cu102 --docker-build-retries 3 --shm-size 500m /work/runtime_functions.sh cd_package_pypi cu102`\r\n\r\n- ran this command (correct) before the commit got merged:\r\n`ci/build.py -e RELEASE_BUILD=true --docker-registry mxnetci --nvidiadocker --platform centos7_gpu_cu102 --docker-build-retries 3 --shm-size 500m /work/runtime_functions.sh cd_package_pypi cu102`\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo basically if we are not specifying `env_vars` then its default value is `[]`, no problem. But if we pass in String obj then `env_vars = env_vars.collect { \"-e ${it}\" }` will break the string into letters.

Description ##\r\nWhen the input is a single variable, autograd is supposed to return a single variable. However, it returns a list. Upon further investigation, I realized that the input variable is overwritten as a list without getting converted back. This fix separates out the flag to convert the output back to variable.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [-] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [-] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Potentially backward incompatible but people who use it should be able to notice the inconsistency and avoid this particular use case.\r\n- Edge case: what if the input is neither a variable nor a list? Proper input validation should be done.","created_at":"2020-10-02T04:49:14Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T19:24:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb73609c47ce72519ecdb28d198b20ed741fd81f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR greatly increases the speed of pointwise fusion graph pass. As a test case I used XLNet from Gluon-NLP which did expose slowness in this graph pass before: #17105 - the total time of fwd+bwd fusion after the fix from that issue was ~8s, after this PR the time is ~11 ms, with 3 ms of that taken by IndexedGraph construction from the original graph (so the actual fusion graph pass takes ~8ms for that case - about 1000x improvement).\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this PR is getting the pointwise fusion graph pass to be lightweight enough to possibly be run every time the shapes change in the graph, enabling the fusion to be shape-aware. This is important as in 2.0 NumPy semantics make multiple operations (like add, sub etc.) broadcast by default, even if in the end they are simple elementwise operations. This PR does not fully get us there (I would much like it being <5ms for the network like XLNet to be sure it is lightweight enough to not be bottleneck for all usecases), although there are some parts that would not be needed anymore if we could make this pass after infershape is already done (e.g. we would not need to insert `FusedOpHelper`/`FusedOpOutHelper`, which currently takes a little over 1ms). That  said, it is a big step in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe main problem that the fusion graph pass needs to solve is not allowing the cycles to be formed: nodes which both consume the output of and provide the input to a single subgraph. The original pointwise fusion graph pass' algorithm to avoid cycles was to first construct a mapping, which nodes are excluded to be in the same subgraph with a given node. The construction of the mapping was simple but inefficient (and then improved in #17114, but still pretty slow):\r\n```\r\nfor each node n that does not qualify to be in a subgraph:\r\n    outputs = nodes reached by DFS from n in the direction of n's outputs\r\n    inputs = nodes reached by DFS from n in the direction of n's inputs\r\n    for each output in outputs:\r\n        for each input in inputs:\r\n            put (input, output) and (output, input) pair into the exclusion mapping\r\n```\r\nThis was `O(n^3)` algorithm (improved in #17114 to be `O(n^2)` on average) and required a separate `BidirectionalGraph` datastructure that enabled DFS in both directions.\r\n\r\nThe new algorithm for pointwise fusion graph pass is designed based on 2 observations:\r\n - most of the entries in the exclusion mappings are not useful, as those nodes are not considered to be part of the same subgraph\r\n - we can traverse the graph in topological order, which the original algorithm did not take advantage of\r\n\r\nIn the new algorithm the graph is traversed in the topological order (and so we are sure that all the inputs of the current node were already processed) and each node has its own exclusion set of subgraphs that it can't be a part of. The exclusion set of node is constructed as the union of the exclusion sets of its inputs + all the subsets that its inputs are part of if the node itself is ineligible to be in a subgraph. Because subsets can merge (e.g. when you have operation `a + b` where `a` is part of subgraph s1 and `b` is part of subgraph s2, then s1 and s2 need to be merged into a single subgraph containing everything from s1, s2 and the `+` operator), the mapping is maintained to know which other subsets the current subset is merged with. \r\n\r\nThere are number of additional optimizations:\r\n - because of the topological ordering of the graph traversal, subset ids in the exclusion set are typically consecutive number (or a small group of consecutive numbers) -> therefore in the exclusion set we actually keep intervals of numbers instead of the numbers themselves\r\n - in most cases the union of exclusion sets is equal to one of the sets -> in order to avoid costly unnecessary memory allocations, we share the exclusion sets between nodes\r\n - the fwd and bwd fusions are done together in a single pass to avoid overheads\r\n\r\nThe second part of the PR is the overhaul of the actual subgraph substitution - previously it was done 1 subgraph at a time, with multiple `DFSVisit` calls per subgraph. Unfortunately `DFSVisit` is costly and most of that work was wasted (as the DFS over the entire graph was needed for the substitution of a few nodes. In the new approach a new graph is created based on the subgraph assignment generated in the previous part, which requires only a single pass over the graph to apply all subgraphs.\r\n\r\n@samskalicky
