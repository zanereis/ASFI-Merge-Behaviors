is a solution to #881.\nSummary:\n- Each `WorkUnitState`/`TaskState` now contains a `JobState` reference, rather than a copy of all properties in `JobState`. `WorkUnitState.getProp()` will first look for the property in its own properties, then in its `WorkUnit`, then in its `JobState`.\n- `DatasetState` no longer contains properties in `JobState`, and no longer supports `setProp` or `getProp` methods (will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`). A `DatasetState` can only contain a few specific properties such as `dataset.urn`, and they are accessed via specific setter and getter methods (e.g., `setDatasetUrn()` and `getDatasetUrn()`).\n  - The rationale is the following: a `DatasetState` is created in the driver after the job is done. At this point there shouldn’t be a need to look for, change or add any general properties, especially since the driver is not something pluggable like the constructs, where different people can plug in an arbitrarily customized one for their use cases. Also, the driver already has a copy of `JobState`. If it wants to query any properties it can directly query the `JobState`.\n  - This means that properties in the `JobState`, which are properties from the job config file and the global property file, will not be persisted into the state store. Since these are static properties rather than runtime properties (runtime properties are in `TaskState`s), there's no need to persist them.\n\nThese changes result in a ~90% reduction in memory consumption of a Gobblin job.\n","created_at":"2016-04-18T23:33:55Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T17:42:43Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T17:42:42Z","merged_at":"2016-05-03T17:42:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"3366cf9d4e5b4309d1247c2360c9c0b4c3b41a4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/53b908f20ee7094bc3b50bd7117aa9910ccf0327","head":{"label":"zliu41:snooker","ref":"snooker","sha":"53b908f20ee7094bc3b50bd7117aa9910ccf0327","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32048123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjA0ODEyMw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"zliu41/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/

Changes\n- Added support to resolve system and environment variables in config management. Both in `main.conf` and `includes.conf`\n- `Typesafe Config` expects the system/env key to be in the format `${?sys.prop.key}`. Note that `?` signifies system/env variables.\n- Added support to resolve system/env variables in `includes.conf`. Since `includes.conf` is in plain text with one include per line, it can not be parsed as `TypeSafe Config`. To workaround that we build a `TypeSafe Config` objects with key `includes` and value a list of include paths. This config object is then resolved with fallback on system/env properties.\n\nE.g. If the includes.conf file looks like\n\n<pre>\n/path/to/tag1\n/path/to/${?sys.key1}\n</pre>\n\n\nIt gets loaded in memory as a `TypeSafe Config` object, \n\n<pre>\nincludes = [/path/to/tag1, /path/to/${?sys.key1}]\n</pre>\n\n\nThen resolved with fallback on system/env properties as,\n\n<pre>\nincludes = [/path/to/tag1, /path/to/sys.value1]\n</pre>\n\n- Fixed bug in resolutions.

Changes\n\nThis is part-1 for adding retention support for tracking data. The new policies for tracking retention will be in a different pr.\n- Allow retention to use `gobblin.data.management.policy.VersionSelectionPolicy` and `gobblin.data.management.version.finder.VersionFinder`. I have deprecated the old retentionPolicy and versionFinder but the code is backward compatible for existing jobs using them\n- Add support for retention jobs to specify multiple versions and policy combinations. This is useful for many datasets where each partition needs to have a different retention/selection policy. For instance tracking data, hourly has a different policy than daily. This class is called `MultiVersionCleanableDatasetBase`\n- Fix config keys in all the new selection policies and version finders to be more meaningful and work well with typesafe. The policies and finders will have local key paths as opposed to global paths. For ex. in the `NewestKSelectionPolicy` the versions retained key will be `selection.newestK.versionsSelected` instead of `gobblin.retention.selection.newestK.versionsSelected` this will allow us to use the policy for jobs other than retention like distcp-ng. The class instantiating the policy is responsible for converting the global config paths to local paths. In the retention case, `ConfigurableCleanableDataset` passes `config.getConfig(\"gobblin.retention\")` to the constructor of `NewestKSelectionPolicy`.\n\n@ibuenros and @ydai1124 Please review.\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T01:13:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T02:26:59Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T02:26:59Z","merged_at":"2016-04-12T02:26:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"304a75b66dd240548603a81bafcb61114a864909","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4e8f3a89432671c275097833daa8514f8e2a2a01","head":{"label":"pcadabam-zz:trackingRetention","ref":"trackingRetention","sha":"4e8f3a89432671c275097833daa8514f8e2a2a01","user":{"login":"pcadabam-zz","id":1166372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36956709,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk1NjcwOQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"pcadabam-zz/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pcadabam-zz","id":1166372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcadabam-zz/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.

This finder will be used for audit retention\n- Added a mechanism to run end-to-end integration/functional tests for retention. Unit tests alone are not sufficient as we have broken backward compatibilty several times. These tests define the config contracts provided to the user by gobblin-retention.\n- `RetentionTestDataGenerator` reads a test config file to create dummy data before the test. After the test is run, it validates if the right files/dirs were deleted. Format of the config file is described in the javadoc of `RetentionTestDataGenerator`\n- `RetentionIntegrationTest` runs the actual integration using `RetentionTestDataGenerator` to setup and validate\n- Directory structure in classpath for integration test resources.\n\n<pre>\ntest/resources/retentionIntegrationTest/\n        ├── testNewestKRetention //Represents a test\n        │   ├── retention.conf  //conifgs used by the user, finder, policy etc\n        │   └── setup_validate.conf // Used to generate test data\n        └── testTimeBasedRetention\n            ├── retention.conf\n            └── setup_validate.conf\n </pre>\n- `RetentionIntegrationTest` looks for `setup_validate.conf` file for a test and creates the data required for this test. It then runs gobblin retention using `retention.conf` file for this test. Next validates for deleted files.\n\n@chavdar please

in distcp.\n\nDistcp was trying to set unnecessary permissions and groups the user was not allowed to set in the staging directory. The cause is that we replicate ancestor permissions, and previously it was replicating all ancestors up to root path. At publish time this is not an issue because paths like \"/\" and \"/data\" already exist and we don't overwrite them. However, in the staging directory we recreate this structure and attempt to set the same permissions, so we would create \"/path/to/staging/directory/data\" with group \"hdfs\", which user is not allowed to set.\n\nThis PR restricts the default permission replication to only directories that don't exist on the target, and for the RecursiveCopyableDataset it only sets permissions between the non-globbed input path and the target

base interfaces for value auditing. The pr mainly has interfaces for \n- `RowSelectionPolicy` - An interface to decide if a row needs to be audited\n- `ColomnProjectionPolicy` - An interface that projects certain columns/fields of an input {@link GenericRecord} to generate a new {@link GenericRecord} that can be audited.\n- `AuditSink` - An interface for persisting value audits\n- `ValueAuditGenerator` - The class that implements value based auditing. The class captures the values of certain columns from the rows in the dataset using the {@link ColumnProjectionPolicy}. This is done for every row or for a sample of the rows as defined by the {@link RowSelectionPolicy}\n- The module that drives auditing will create an instance of `ValueAuditGenerator` for each avro

of the Graphite and InfluxDB reporters that were removed in https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/pull/429 due to the changes in Metric API.\n\nGraphite:\n- Supports sending through UDP and TCP \n- Metric and/or event reporter can be toggled\n- Additional parameter `metrics.reporting.graphite.events.value.as.key`: \n  - For those backends that don't allow strings as event values (e.g: InfluxDB's Graphite protocol)\n    In this case the event value will be added to the end of the key\n\nInfluxDB:\n- Metric and/or event reporter can be toggled\n- Only TCP as influxdb-java 2.1 doesn't support UDP yet\n\nBoth were tested on InfluxDB 0.9.4.1.\n\nRefactoring:\n- Restructured configuration keys for the metric reporters and classes of metric/event names\n- Timing event related event names are now in the `TimingEvent` class\n- Metric reporting configurations are moved from `MetricReportReport` to a new base class `ConfiguredScheduledReporter`.\n  To report non-serialized metrics one can extend `ConfiguredScheduledReporter`, for serialized Avro records `MetricReportReport` can be subclassed\n- Duplicate class: MetricGroup  -> gobblin.runtime.MetricGroup was removed\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T02:29:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T17:11:06Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T16:51:13Z","merged_at":"2016-05-05T16:51:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"9fbf36388ba44af50e5b9a407c1020ecd987e429","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6ad8cd2010d28a0d4b32dc5ee44f9825e9fb9261","head":{"label":"swisscom-bigdata:swc_reporters","ref":"swc_reporters","sha":"6ad8cd2010d28a0d4b32dc5ee44f9825e9fb9261","user":{"login":"swisscom-bigdata","id":11226371,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExMjI2Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11226371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata","html_url":"https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54065664,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDA2NTY2NA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"swisscom-bigdata/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swisscom-bigdata","id":11226371,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExMjI2Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11226371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata","html_url":"https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swisscom-bigdata/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swisscom-bigdata/gobblin","description":"Universal

review?\n","created_at":"2016-03-10T21:27:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T23:48:38Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T23:48:36Z","merged_at":"2016-03-15T23:48:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"b82d1a23a09935789e51839398dcd5b2efb345c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/81151708dba79bf7c23354afd17b7692c88bd69d","head":{"label":"sahilTakiar:useHadoop2Fix","ref":"useHadoop2Fix","sha":"81151708dba79bf7c23354afd17b7692c88bd69d","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38903584,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODkwMzU4NA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"sahilTakiar/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar/gobblin","description":"Universal

Parallelized generating `HiveSpec`s in `HiveRegistrationPublisher` using a `CompletionService`.\n- In `HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister`, added methods `needToUpdateTable` and `needToUpdatePartition` to determine whether an existing table/partition needs to be altered. Previously it was using the `equals` method in `Table` and `Partition` but that was not a good choice since Hive automatically adds or modifies properties to existing tables and partitions, such as last access time, location (from raw to fully qualified), retention, isCompressed, etc., which causes `equals` to never return true. This means existing tables and partitions are always altered which is expensive.\n- Added `haveSameSchema` method in `HiveSerDeManager`. This helps reduce the number of unnecessary schema updates which is expensive.\n- Removed `HiveStripedLocks` since Hive metastore (usually RDBMS) should be able to handle concurrent requests.\n- Added

Issues\n- Partial fix for #792\n- Full fix for #802\n#### Description\n- Adding an `ApplicationLauncher` interface that is responsible for launching Gobblin applications\n  - Gobblin Applications are launched in a variety of ways - `AzkabanJobLauncher`, `GobblinApplicationMaster`, `CliLocalJobLauncher`, `CliMRJobLauncher`, `SchedulerDaemon`\n- A base implementation of `ApplicationLauncher` called `ServiceBasedApplicationLauncher` defines a `ApplicationLauncher` is a collection of Guava `Service`s that need to be run\n  - A core set of `Service`s are always run, and sub-classes can add more `Service`s\n- All Gobblin Application Launchers mentioned above now extend `ServiceBasedApplicationLauncher`\n  - A lot of common functionality between all these classes has been moved into `ServiceBasedApplicationLauncher`\n- A `MetricsReportingService` has been added that starts and stops metrics reporting - this fixes the two issues mentioned above since metrics will only be started and stopped once per application\n- The `gobblin-scheduler` submodule has been deleted and its classed moved into `gobblin-runtime` - this way `gobblin-runtime` can use the scheduler classes in a more generic manner\n- Added a `JMXReportingService` for collecting JVM stats and reporting them via JMX (this code was duplicated in a few places so I moved it into a separate class)\n#### Reviewing this PR\n- `ApplicationLauncher` and `ServiceBasedApplicationLauncher` are the best places to start\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T01:00:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T16:59:48Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T16:59:46Z","merged_at":"2016-03-14T16:59:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"3305645c394924e458320e7f6148fb6b6679ee8b","assignee":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":153127082,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxMjcwODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/Bug:Generic","name":"Bug:Generic","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/22d4e6dd44f38825265fa1ed37fee302d6cf27d6","head":{"label":"sahilTakiar:Issue-#792","ref":"Issue-#792","sha":"22d4e6dd44f38825265fa1ed37fee302d6cf27d6","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38903584,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODkwMzU4NA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"sahilTakiar/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.gith
