this PR only the individual disabling of the newly introduced max score pruning is introduced, which is needed for experimental analysis.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nThe current state management was not working correctly for incremental updates that are based on stats and lattice from a run of incSliceLine that already depend on stats and lattice from an even earlier run. This is because the slices and stats that are pruned through incremental pruning methods are not stored for subsequent increments even though we mostly have all the necessary information. I updated the code to track the lost slices and stats and add them to the output lattice and statistics (L and Stats) lists as well. Also, currently, some tests run into errors when enabling the new approx pruning method, which is why for now I set the enabling boolean to FALSE.","created_at":"2024-09-24T09:51:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T13:10:47Z","closed_at":"2024-09-28T13:10:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dbc30f8dbf8974b1f7804089ef5d5bda47f0343e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2116/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2116/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2116/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/93b5f3421bb1919e39a6e105df42b3453b915aae","head":{"label":"fzoepffel:updated-pruning-disabling-for-both-scoring-methods","ref":"updated-pruning-disabling-for-both-scoring-methods","sha":"93b5f3421bb1919e39a6e105df42b3453b915aae","user":{"login":"fzoepffel","id":112855814,"node_id":"U_kgDOBroLBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112855814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel","html_url":"https://github.com/fzoepffel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":719469435,"node_id":"R_kgDOKuI7ew","name":"systemds","full_name":"fzoepffel/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fzoepffel","id":112855814,"node_id":"U_kgDOBroLBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112855814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel","html_url":"https://github.com/fzoepffel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzoepffel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fzoepffel/systemds","description":"An

pull request aims to improve test coverage of the classes RewriteAlgebraicSimplificationStatic/Dynamic, RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimizationSparse/Transpose and to identify potential issues there.\r\n\r\n### 1. RewriteAlgebraicSimplificationStatic\r\n\r\n- **Covered rewrite rules:** simplifyCTableWithConstMatrixInputs, simplifyDistributiveBinaryOperation, simplifyBushyBinaryOperation, fuseBinarySubDAGToUnaryOperation, simplifyTraceMatrixMult, simplifyConstantSort, simplifyOrderedSort, simplifyTransposeAggBinaryChains, simplifyReplaceZeroOperation, fuseMinusNzBinaryOperation, fuseLogNzBinaryOperation, fuseLogNzUnaryOperation, simplifyCumsumReverse\r\n\r\n- **Identified Issues:** The rewrite `simplifyBushyBinaryOperation` is not entered by the corresponding statements                         ( (X*(Y*(Z%*%v))) or (X+(Y+(Z%*%v))) ). The conditional statements at the beginning of the rewrite seem not to match the input statements. Test methods that do not implement the rewrite are evaluated to _failed_.\r\n\r\n### 2. RewriteAlgebraicSimplificationDynamic\r\n\r\n- **Covered rewrite rules:** fuseLeftIndexingChainToAppend, simplifyEmptyColMeans, simplifySumDiagToTrace, simplifyLowerTriExtraction, simplifyNnzComputation, pushDownBinaryOperationOnDiag, simplifyWeightedUnaryMM, simplifyWeightedSquaredLoss, simpliyWeightedSigmoidMMChains\r\n\r\n- **Identified Issues:** The rewrite `simplifyWeightedUnaryMM` is not executed for all 3 patterns it covers. The reason for this is that the if conditions seem not to match the actual statement patterns. I could correct some of them and then the rewrite was successfully executed. However, in this patch, I did not change the actual rewrite itself because this might result in unintentional consequences for other rewrites. The test methods not implementing the rewrite fail accordingly. \r\nAnother rewrite that causes problems is `simplifyWeightedSigmoidMMChains`. Here, the missing transpose is not caught by the rewrite although it implements such logic. The reason for this bug is that the code misses an additional line like `tx = tx.getInput().get(0)`. This can be achieved by either adding this line or removing the `else`-clause that follows the transpose creation. I tried it and the missing transpose was caught and correctly replaced. Again, these changes are not part of this patch to avoid unintended consequences. The test methods not catching the missing transpose fail accordingly.\r\n\r\n### 3. RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimizationSparse & RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimizationTranspose\r\nI also added testing to these classes and corrected existing test cases for _RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimizationTranspose_. These two classes had zero percent coverage because they were not linked to the `ProgramRewriter` class. Hence, they are never called. I added them both under `dynamicRewrites` below `RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimization` and `RewriteElementwiseMultChainOptimization`. Since `RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimizationSparse` overrides the standard `RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimization`, I wanted to be on the safe side and introduced in the `OptimizerUtils` a new flag called `ALLOW_ADVANCED_MMCHAIN_REWRITES`, which by default is set to false. I did this because I am not sure if it is actually intended to call RewriteMatrixMultChainOptimizationSparse/Transpose by default (e.g., maybe they contain bugs and are thus not part of the compilation). This flag is, in contrast to most other flags like `ALLOW_SUM_PRODUCT_REWRITES`, or `ALLOW_OPERATOR_FUSION`, set to false. I would be grateful for feedback on this issue.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent PRs all the failing tests should be investigated and corrected (i.e., the corresponding rewrites).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-23T02:13:16Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T07:33:59Z","closed_at":"2024-09-24T07:33:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1ef765409ee750b3a06840e2e55c7451c106b1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/46d3e27aee44c647da55c46ac60946c86177ef84","head":{"label":"ReneEnjilian:additional-rewrite-testing","ref":"additional-rewrite-testing","sha":"46d3e27aee44c647da55c46ac60946c86177ef84","user":{"login":"ReneEnjilian","id":38861000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODYxMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38861000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian","html_url":"https://github.com/ReneEnjilian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703796657,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfMVsQ","name":"systemds","full_name":"ReneEnjilian/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ReneEnjilian","id":38861000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODYxMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38861000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian","html_url":"https://github.com/ReneEnjilian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneEnjilian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ReneEnjilian/systemds","description":"An

are many significant changes to the existing implementation and logic of the Cost Estimator and some basic tests to increase the coverage. \r\n\r\nState of the Cost Estimator:\r\n* Supports more CP instructions\r\n* Supports now a basic spectrum of Spark instructions\r\n* Supports inferring of variables's dimensions for several instructions (CP and Spark)\r\n* Implements lineage-like logic for getting the estimated cost of Spark instructions \r\n* Extended the Cost Estimator framework to include resource metrics not relevant for the compilation but relevant for the cost (mem/disk/network bandwidth, CPU NLFOPS)\r\n\r\nAbout the tests:\r\n* Not many tests were added, but some general test classes with examples created which can be extended to increase the coverage\r\n* Currently supported algorithms: L2SVM, LinReg, PCA, PNMF; Means excluded <- includes parser + many unknowns\r\n* Further tests for the enumerators should follow soon with the finalised version of the enumerators themselves\r\n\r\n*Note: it took longer than discussed but I also added a simplified logic to account for disk spill-overs reading at Spark operations to cover the potential scenarios we discussed.

PR separates part of the content from a previous PR (https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2103).\r\n\r\n- `TestUtils::writeTestMatrix()`: When writing mtx files, the last number in the header should represent the number of non-zero elements in the matrix. However, in the existing JavaTest, it was showing the total number of elements, which caused an error when reading the mtx file using Python's `scipy.mmread()` function. This bug has been fixed. (Reference: https://networkrepository.com/mtx-matrix-market-format.html)\r\n\r\n- `TestUtils::readRMatrixFromFS()`: While R writes the mtx header in 2 lines, Python's scipy writes it in 3 lines, including an additional line containing only a `%` symbol. I modified the code to skip such blank lines when reading mtx files in JavaTest, so that no errors

PR implements a new roll reorg function in CP and provides test scripts using Python.\r\n\r\n1. Implementation of roll function for dense and sparse matrices in CP, along with test code\r\n- Similar to `rev`, dense column vectors are rolled column-wise, while the rest are rolled row-wise.\r\n\r\n2. Support for Python test code and additional test cases\r\n- Since R does not provide a `roll` function, baseline test scripts were written using Python's numpy `roll` function.\r\n- Added support for executing the test code in Python. Although there is some overlap with the R script execution code, I avoided modifying or refactoring the existing code to minimize changes.\r\n- However, due to slight differences in the `mtx` format between R and Python, I made the following modifications to the `mtx` file input/output code:\r\n  - `TestUtils::writeTestMatrix()`: The last number in the mtx header should represent the number of non-zero elements in the matrix, but the previous input test matrix was showing the total number of elements, which caused an error in Python. (https://networkrepository.com/mtx-matrix-market-format.html)\r\n  - `TestUtils::readRMatrixFromFS()`: While R writes the mtx header in 2 lines, Python's scipy writes it in 3 lines, including an extra line with just a %. I modified the code to ignore this blank line.\r\n  \r\nPlease feel free to share any feedback or suggestions regarding the implementation direction.","created_at":"2024-09-06T14:06:50Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T08:16:58Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T07:59:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"393df054ab3d35a5742ded311b0b07d5fbf8c7fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/db4c08501eddf047421fba13d520075d6149d91a","head":{"label":"min-guk:main","ref":"main","sha":"db4c08501eddf047421fba13d520075d6149d91a","user":{"login":"min-guk","id":87025898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87025898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk","html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"c94050265827deab65200c1b2ba4bad60f6d6f96","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45896813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5NjgxMw==","name":"systemds","full_name":"apache/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds","description":"An

are the bases for the Enumerators for Resource optimisation with the first 2 enumerators:\r\n- GridBasedEnumerator\r\n- InterestBasedEnumerator\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, some utility classes/methods were created for recompilation in the current case. It is still to be investigated how much better this recompilation approach is compared to the existing one.\r\n\r\nTo allow the desired functionality, small changes were made to the following classes of the existing SystemDS code base:\r\n- src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/conf/CompilerConfig.java\r\n   * creating a new configuration type to avoid further changes that would affect the basic functionality at script execution\r\n- src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/hops/Hop.java\r\n   * the only place the new configuration type comes in place to allow reassigning execution type\r\n- src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/lops/compile/Dag.java\r\n   * resetUniqueMembers() - to be used at (re)compilation \r\n- src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/runtime/controlprogram/context/SparkExecutionContext.java\r\n   * initLocalSparkContext() to avoid real Spark context initialisation\r\n- src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/runtime/controlprogram/parfor/stat/InfrastructureAnalyzer.java\r\n   * allowing setting local parallelism from outside \r\n\r\nBesides these required changes I have made a tiny change that looked to me that could be useful for the SystemDS project overall:\r\n- src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/hops/OptimizerUtils.java: replacing `getNumMappers` and `getNumReducers` to `getNumTasks` since Spark and not MapReduce is the new/current framework used for distributed execution\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-16T21:21:15Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T17:48:21Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T17:48:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3d47e10de90d6e5d77ccdbb62da9e9b988fe87f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/5b80258c1c7754dac63fc3d2832912cb3d9f8b19","head":{"label":"lachezar-n:enumeration","ref":"enumeration","sha":"5b80258c1c7754dac63fc3d2832912cb3d9f8b19","user":{"login":"lachezar-n","id":74593108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTkzMTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74593108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n","html_url":"https://github.com/lachezar-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":758990297,"node_id":"R_kgDOLT1F2Q","name":"systemds","full_name":"lachezar-n/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lachezar-n","id":74593108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTkzMTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74593108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n","html_url":"https://github.com/lachezar-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachezar-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lachezar-n/systemds","description":"An

this PR incremental SliceLine was further developed.  The following functionalities were added:\r\n\r\nUPDATE Aug. 9: also added handling of removed slices. Now a list of indices can be provided that indicate which slices of the previous dataset are removed from the dataset. This information is used for pruning, too.\r\n\r\n- a params list parameter ensures consistent parameters over all runs\r\n- further parameters were added that are necessary for pruning\r\n- a function was added to determine the unchanged slices on each level\r\n- several pruning strategies were added or adjusted. e.g. score pruning based on the lowest (updated) score of the previous top k was added (basic slices and normal slices are pruned), unchanged slices under the minSup are removed right away. \r\n- consistent one hot encoded matrices are ensured \r\n- encoding and decoding functions with domain size scaling were added. If the parameter encodeLat is set to true the lattice is stored in an encoded form for reduced size. \r\n- the prevStats only include the slice sizes as the other columns are not needed for pruning\r\n- the code was cleaned up, comments were added, larger code snippets were replaced by functions\r\n- first experiments have indicated a strong decrease in execution time, especially if the number of added tuples is significantly smaller than the total number of slices in an incremental run. This is the case because a larger number of added tuples usually tends to change a larger portion of slices. Only unchanged slices can lead to significant efficiency increases.

PR is an extension to PR #2045 and implements support for data-dependent n-grams using and extending the existing lineage functionality. As we are dealing with DAGs which are not linear sequences of instructions, I implemented the extension in such a way that it tracks every instruction path of the length `n`. If we had for example the DAG `(a*b + c/d)` and wanted to record bigrams, the two operation sequences `[(*, +), (/, +)]` would be added to the bigram store. I also keep track of the individual data-types of each instruction which is why I extended the existing lineage functionality as the `_data` string is sometimes empty and contains inconsistent information.\r\n\r\nThe n-gram table now looks like this, where the arguments within brackets show the input parameters of an instruction (separated by `°`) and the suffix `[i]` represents the parameter index for the following instruction (e.g. for the first entry the result of `rblk` is used as the second paremeter for `ba+*`):\r\n```\r\nMost common 2-grams (sorted by absolute time):\r\n

pull request implements the Scalable  Linear Algebra Benchmark (Slab). The benchmark divides the workloads into 3 segments: (1) Matrix operators, (2) Pipelines and Decompositions, (3) Bulk LA-based ML Algorithms. For those different workloads we vary different parameters like number of rows and sparsity. In the original paper, the authors also varied parameters like number of nodes in their cluster. These parallel experiments are executed via Apache Spark. Given the constraints of my setup (only a single CPU), I only executed these experiments via spark on my CPU. To run it via multiple CPUs, one would need to create a Spark cluster manually. I left the experiment output files in this pull request for better reviewing purposes. The output folders can of course be deleted when merging in. \r\n\r\n### Potential Bug\r\nI noticed that the `tsmm` operator causes error messages in some experiments as can be observed in the output directories of operators/distributed_sparse and mlAlgorithms/distributed. For the first the corresponding file is slabGramMatrixSparse_stats.txt and for the latter slabHeteroscedasticityRobustStandardErrorsDistr_stats.txt. I couldn't figure out so far why the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` happens

Checking if column groups are One-Hot-Encoded before compression\r\n\r\nThis patch adds checks on column groups to verify if multiple columns, together, are One Hot Encoded. In that case, these column groups are compressed accordingly into an IdentityDictionary to exploit the structure of One Hot Encoded columns and optimize the subsequent operations. We observe a reduction in the number of column groups of up to 98%, with most experiments seeing a reduction of over 80%. However, the overhead on execution time is large for larger datasets due to the current implementation of the compression of One-Hot-Encoded columns. \r\nDetailed documentation can be found in

this pull request, I have done below changes\r\n1. I add permutation-matrix as second method for raGroupby,  for a more efficient raGroupby which constructs a permutation matrix (0/1 matrix) in order to copy relevant tuples with a single matrix multiplication followed by a reshape to bring the matrix into the form of one row per group. I also test multiple methods at the the same time in the runRaGroupbyTest function.\r\n2. I improve the sort-merge function in raJoin by avoid iterating over rows.","created_at":"2024-07-23T21:10:49Z","updated_at":"2024-07-27T16:55:26Z","closed_at":"2024-07-27T16:55:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca8a723b658479933bfb8d875f65a73ec2089021","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/2052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/31710e67af4bff21a559b77cf629815787523f80","head":{"label":"gghsu:branch0723","ref":"branch0723","sha":"31710e67af4bff21a559b77cf629815787523f80","user":{"login":"gghsu","id":25980209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTgwMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25980209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu","html_url":"https://github.com/gghsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":802492537,"node_id":"R_kgDOL9UQeQ","name":"systemds","full_name":"gghsu/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gghsu","id":25980209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTgwMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25980209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu","html_url":"https://github.com/gghsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gghsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gghsu/systemds","description":"An

patch adds a dml script for the bidirectional LSTM layer. The script leverages the existing functionality of the standard LSTM layer for computing one pass in the normal direction and one in the reversed direction by reversing the order input tokens on the temporal dimension.\r\n\r\nI tried out two approaches for the reversing and ran small benchmark locally, and chose the better performing one.\r\nThe faster approach 1 uses the rev() operator together with transpose(), since rev() only reverses on column axis. \r\n`X_reverse = t(rev(t(X)))                    # reverse the elements inside a row`\r\n`W_reverse[1:D,] = rev(W_reverse[1:D,])      # have to reverse the input weights as well`\r\n\r\nThe other approach 2 uses a for loop over the temporal axis and slicing.\r\n`X_reverse = matrix(0, rows=nrow(X), cols=ncol(X))`\r\n`for (i in 1:T){X_reverse[,(T - i)*D+1:(T - i + 1)*D] = X[,(i-1)*D+1:i*D]}`\r\n\r\nI added test cases which compare the results to csv files with expected results that were computed using pytorch's Bi-LSTM implementation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the backward is not included in the commit, since I have to fix an error, that I found while testing. I'll add another commit / do another PR for backward pass today or tomorrow once I got it

Main Updated:\r\n\r\n1. Fixed a bug that while using multi-GPU with CUDA caused a \"CurrentModificationException\" error in `ParForProgramBlock`, where the GPU memory is modified during the process of freeing. Multi-GPU can now be used to accerate the `parfor` function and other functions using multiple workers and threads.\r\n2. The mismatch between `_numThreads` and the actual number of threads is resolved when using multiple GPUs device but only allowing a single GPU (`sysds.gpu.availableGPUs=1`) to run `parfor` functions with multiple workers and multiple threads.\r\n\r\n## Other bugs in Multi-GPU process:\r\n\r\n1. In a multi-GPU environment, when initializing the first instance of `GPUContext` for `cudnnHandle`, `cublasHandle`, and `cusparseHandle` in Jcuda version `10.2.0`, the Native code freezes when executing into Jcuda code. The program cannot continue. This error can easily happen in the test environment of \"4070+1080\" dual graphics card environment, but sometimes it works fine. This bug is not present in Jcuda version `11.8.0`. This is presumed to be a Jcuda issue and cannot be fixed by SystemDS. \r\n- We have tested and drawn an conclusion that Jcuda with version `10.2.0` is not support the GPUs with Ampere Architecture or higher (A100, H100 or products of the same/higher period, RTX 30 and 40 series or higher).\r\n\r\n## Other bugs outside Multi-GPU process we found:\r\n\r\n1. Example script `scripts/nn/examples/AttentionExample.dml` can not be runned with even one GPU. Error message is `RuntimeException -- Unsupported operator:MAP`.

**Main changes**\r\nThis patch builds upon the previous one for the SparseBlockMCSC class. Here, I implemented the row API defined in SparseBlock utilized by all other sparse block formats (i.e., CSR, COO, MCSR, DCSR). Additionally, I expose for all methods the column API for efficient use in specific operations. By exposing the row API, we can remove all special cases in the sparse test package that were only designed for SparseBlockMCSC (previously it only exposed the column API). All tests in the sparse test package pass for MCSC without handling any column-oriented special cases now.\r\n\r\n### **Bugs in other Sparse Block formats:**\r\nI noticed that in MCSR, COO and CSR the method _size(int rl, int ru, int cl, int cu)_ produces wrong results for a number of certain matrices I tested on. For various shapes defined by rl, ru, cl, and cu, they would produce sometimes negative results.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n-  A = {{10, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0},\r\n           {0, 30, 0, 40, 0, 0},\r\n           {0, 0, 50, 60, 70, 0},\r\n           {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 80}},\r\n\r\n-  rl=0, ru=4, cl=0, and cu=6 (i.e., covering the entire matrix)\r\n- CSR and COO will return -17 instead of 8\r\n\r\nFor other boundaries and matrices similar mistakes happened. I adapted the method for those sparse block formats. Surprisingly, the tests did not catch this

PR implements N-Gram statistics of instruction sequences when adding `-ngrams [<comma-separated tuple sizes> <topK>]` to the command line arguments. For instance, the CLI arguments `-ngrams 2,3 10` will record 2-grams and 3-grams of instruction sequences and will print the top 10 entries of all 2-grams and 3-grams. N-Grams are maintained for each thread individually and are merged together when printing the statistics. \r\n\r\nThe table is currently sorted by the cumulative execution time of the instruction sequence (over all occurrences of that sequence). For example, a table could look like this:\r\n```\r\nMost common 2-grams (sorted by absolute time):\r\n  #  N-Gram                 Time(s)  StdDev(t)/Mean(t)  Count\r\n  1  (sp_rblk, createvar)

pull request implements the Modified Compressed Sparse Column (MCSC) block. So far, most sparse blocks in SystemDS were row oriented (MCSR, CSR, DCSR). MCSC follows a similar design as MCSR but storing individual columns instead of rows. For simplicity, we reused the existing SparseRowVector/SparseRowScalar classes for the columns. The main contribution is in SparseBlockMCSC.java, where the entire structure is implemented. Further, testing has been added. \r\n\r\nSubsequent tasks may require a deeper integration into the system. Specifically, a deeper integration is required regarding alignment, iterators and merging with other matrices.

the Implicit QL Algorithm also used by the `EigenDecomposition` class using SystemDS data structures. Note this assumes the matrix is symmetric and fits in 1 block of a DenseBlock. The later is also assumed by the current `computeEigen` function so the only missed functionality is the support for non-symmetric matrices. The implementation focused on reducing as much allocations as possible to match and exceed the performance of the current eigen decomposition function across most cases.\r\n\r\nAs an initial benchmark, a test was run with Symmetric Positive Definite and tridiagonal (symmetric) matrices of sizes 100x100, 500x500 and 1000x1000. The following table shows the test cases and amount of iterations done per test.\r\n\r\n|Test case| Iterations|\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| spdTest100 | 300 |\r\n| spdTest500 | 100 |\r\n| spdTest1000 | 30 |\r\n| tridiagonalTest100 | 300 |\r\n| tridiagonalTest500 | 100 |\r\n| tridiagonalTest1000 | 30 |\r\n\r\nWhat follows are the results of the benchmark, showing an average improvement of 48.95 % across all cases with highest improvements in the largest matrices of 1000x1000 size, with up to a 83% improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n  |  #|  Instruction| Iterations|          Time(s) Old | Time(s) New |

patch fixes the binary cbind operation for the spark backend (FrameAppendRSPInstruction) for the edge case when the inputs have different block alignments.\r\nThe RHS input is aligned to the LHS by the following steps:\r\n- collect on Index RDD of the LHS, sort the array of indices\r\n- map each FrameBlock from RHS to the correct FrameBlock on the LHS by doing binary search on the index array\r\n   - > if necessary slice block on the RHS and map it to multiple Blocks on the LHS\r\n   \r\nAdditionally, this patch adds test cases for different edge cases regarding the alignment.

[SYSTEMDS-3529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMDS-3529)\r\nThe task was to add to the repository two badges:\r\n1. PyPI downloads badge to show actual usage of the python API of systems and motivate people to contribute to the project.\r\n2. Code coverage badge for test coverage transparency\r\n\r\n# PyPI badge\r\nI decided to include two separate badges to indicate download activity:\r\n\r\n* **Downloads in the last month:** This badge highlights the project's current usage by showing recent downloads.\r\n* **Total downloads:** This badge showcases the project's overall popularity with a potentially impressive number.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration was clarifying that the badges specifically refer to PyPI downloads, since systemd can be installed through various methods. To avoid misleading users, the badge text explicitly mentions 'PyPI downloads'.\r\n\r\nI evaluated several methods for adding the PyPI download badges to the repository and chose the one that fits the best.\r\n\r\n### [shields.io pypi badge](https://shields.io/badges/py-pi-downloads)\r\n![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/systemds?label=PyPI%20downloads)\r\n✅ Simple REST API to access the badge\r\n✅ Reach customization options\r\n✅ Static badge, no need for ci/cd pipeline to update it\r\n✅ Direct REST API to get the badge\r\n✅ [Open source project](https://github.com/badges/shields)\r\n✅ Does let you to change the text on the left side of the badge\r\n❌ **Can show downloads for last month/week/day, cannot show total downloads**\r\n\r\nShields.io uses another API to actually get the value of downloads → it serves as a wrapper. \r\n\r\nI still needed the total number of badges, so I decided to take a look at the API that is used inside of shields.io badge in case it has more functionality than shields.io shows\r\n\r\n### [PyPi stats API](https://pypistats.org/packages/systemds)\r\n\r\n✅ Simple REST API to access the data\r\n✅ Reach customization options\r\n✅ [Open source project](https://github.com/crflynn/pypistats.org)\r\n❌ No API to retrieve the badge, only shields.io is available \r\n❌ **Can show downloads for last month/week/day, cannot show total downloads**\r\n\r\nPyPi stats API does not allow getting total downloads, therefore I did not want to use it.  \r\n\r\n### [Pepy.tech](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/systemds)\r\n\r\n[![Total PyPI downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/systemds?units=abbreviation&period=total&left_color=grey&right_color=blue&left_text=Total%20PyPI%20Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/systemds) [![Monthly PyPI downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/systemds?units=abbreviation&left_color=grey&right_color=blue&left_text=Monthly%20PyPI%20Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/systemds)\r\n\r\n✅ Simple REST API to access the data\r\n✅ Reach customization options\r\n✅ Static badge, no need for ci/cd pipeline to update it\r\n✅ [Open source project](https://github.com/psincraian/pepy/tree/master)\r\n✅ Does let you change the text on the left side of the badge\r\n✅ Direct REST API to get the badge\r\n✅ Can show total and monthly PyPI downloads\r\n\r\nThis solution showed itself the best, as the API allows me to create two badges that I was looking for. The only downside is that `personalized-badge` API is not well documented, and I had to read some of the source code to understand which customization options I actually had.  \r\n\r\nI decided to stay with the default gray and blue badge, as I think it nicely contrasts with other badges and hints that this data is about python.\r\n\r\n[This comment](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/4319#issuecomment-1682919057) helped me find different solutions and understand different ways to count the downloads. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Codecov badge\r\n\r\nFor test coverage badge, I looked at how apache spark created their [badge](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/README.md?plain=1#L13) and decided to try replicating the approach. \r\n\r\n### How to codecov?\r\n1. You need to log in to [codecov webside ](https://app.codecov.io/login) using the github account that has access to systemds repository\r\n2. Find systemds in the list of repositories on the website and click `Configure`\r\n3. You should be met with a page like that: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/systemds/assets/33724450/70608ec3-2375-473a-b9e4-c1fe96b06032)\r\n4. Set given token in projects `Settings` → `Secrets and Variables` → `Actions`\r\n5. Trigger the [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/javaTests.yml) that runs the Java tests for systemds. \r\n6. After successful pipeline runs, Codecov will collect and display your code coverage data on a page like this: https://app.codecov.io/gh/*_your_username_*/systemds\r\n7. Go to the settings page for the systemds repository on Codecov (link provided in previous step). Find and copy the badge link (image provided might be helpful).\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/systemds/assets/33724450/9aaf07c7-fef5-4042-bd75-3802b3c73f72)\r\n8. Change the link in README.md \r\n9. 🎉🎉🎉 Done! You've successfully configured the Codecov badge for your systemds repository!\r\n\r\n### Warnings! Read before merging ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ \r\n\r\nCurrently, the badge might show unknown instead of percent of test coverage as it looks into the main branch of my forked repository. \r\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/evelina-gudauskayte/systemds/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=DK8Z2AP5FV)](https://codecov.io/github/evelina-gudauskayte/systemds)\r\nThis is how it should look like, but this badge is configured to my draft feature branch in fork, instead of original main repo as I do not have such access.\r\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/evelina-gudauskayte/systemds/branch/SYSTEMDS-3529_Code-coverage_PyPI_downloads_draft/graph/badge.svg?token=DK8Z2AP5FV)](https://codecov.io/github/evelina-gudauskayte/systemds)\r\n\r\n**You have to reconfigure the badge before the merge! Current state is not intended to be in the main branch of systemds.**

patch implements the nary append operation for frames (cbind and rbind). For the cbind, there are two physical implementation:\r\n- map-size cbind (w/ broadcast)\r\n- reduce-size cbind\r\nI added test cases to check the functionality of the n-ary operators and I also enabled the Word-Error-Rate test case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patch fixes the map-size cbind operation to handle misaligned frameblocks.\r\nAs discussed, I will make another PR for the misalignment
