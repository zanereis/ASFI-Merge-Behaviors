to this commit, `IndexMap::MapShape` could produce incorrect results when the split factor is greater than the size of the dimension being split.  For example, a buffer of shape `[N]` mapped transformed with `lambda i: [i//4, i%4]` should result in shape `[ceildiv(N,4), 4]`.  However, for `N<4`, the transformed shape was instead `[1, N%4]`.  This results in unexpected shapes when attempting to prepare a buffer for vectorized access.\r\n\r\nThis commit preferentially uses the result of `arith::DetectIterMap` to determine the mapped buffer shape, similar to what is done when computing the inverse.  The old method of `MapShape`, which relied on `arith::EvalSet`, is maintained for transformations that aren't recognized by

is a fix for a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12904.  Prior to then, an exception was raised when the transformation wouldn't be bijective over the transformed buffer's shape.  The PR replaced the bijective check done as part of `DetectIterMap` with a check done on the returned `padding_predicate`.  However, this check was not equivalent, and some transformations could erroneously apply, rather than raising an exception as being non-bijective.\r\n\r\nThis commit re-enables the bijectivity check in `DetectIterMap`, and adds a test case for this behavior.","created_at":"2022-09-28T14:13:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:10:22Z","closed_at":"2022-10-14T18:04:06Z","merged_at":"2022-10-14T18:04:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"493458e552bd6b0cb29e7e453dc3ee4cd649ad57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7ff7811c0360cbab0b44bc41106d62091180dcc7","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:te_transform_layout_bijectivity","ref":"te_transform_layout_bijectivity","sha":"7ff7811c0360cbab0b44bc41106d62091180dcc7","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

current Einsum doesn't utilize `ReduceOp` for reduction. It instead unrolls the whole reduction when defining the computation. It makes the generated result not suitable for analysis as it doesn't contain reduction information. It's also broken for large reductions. This PR provided a new implementation that generates the reduction axes correctly.\r\nGraph level optimizations might be needed for efficient Einsum. This PR only provides compute definition for further analysis and optimizations.\r\n\r\ncc @spectrometerHBH @MasterJH5574 @junrushao @masahi

PR adds TE compute and schedule definitions for int8 conv2d and dense using vrmpy tensorization, and Relay alter layout / legalize to enable using them in e2e settings. Since `vrmpy` is very similar to x86 VNNI or ARM `sdot/udot` instructions, lots of code are shared with existing x86 / ARM backend implementations. \r\n\r\nThis lets us run int8 resnet50 in 146 msec on SD888. All convolutions and the final dense op are tensorized. The current bottleneck is `requantize`-related operations. The test script and model files to run int8 resnet50 are attached below.\r\n\r\n[test_qresnet50.zip](https://github.com/apache/tvm/files/9651888/test_qresnet50.zip)\r\n\r\n@kparzysz-quic @tkonolige

PR refactors tuning APIs to help with developer ergonomics and enable new potential and usecases.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n**📅 Original behavior.** The original monolithic tuning API assumes that tuning is an end-to-end process that transforms an IRModule into a runtime Module. For example, the API below is designed for Relay end-to-end tuning:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import meta_scheduler as ms\r\n\r\nms.tune_relay(\r\n  mod: IRModule,              # The Relay program\r\n  target: Union[str, Target], # Parameters used in the Relay program\r\n  config: TuneConfig,         # Configuration, e.g. number of trials\r\n  work_dir: str,              # Compilation target\r\n  ...\r\n) -> runtime.Module: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**🤔 The challenge.** While striving to be \"the\" API that controls end-to-end tuning, the design ignores a fact that many users desire to compile an neural network without going through the tuning process, and the fact that MetaSchedule is capable of doing so when supplied with a pre-tuned database.\r\n\r\n**🆕 Our refactoring.** Therefore, this PR is introduced to cater those concrete needs by refactoring the monolithic API into 2 or 3 stages, depending how it is used. Take `tune_relay` as another example, now it's refactored into 2 separate APIs, the first of which is slower tuning that returns a database, while the second takes a pre-tuned database for fast Relay compilation.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nms.relay_integration.tune_relay(\r\n    mod: IRModule,\r\n    params: Dict[str, NDArray],\r\n    target: Union[str, Target],\r\n    work_dir: str,\r\n    max_trials_global: int,\r\n    ...\r\n) -> Database: ...\r\n\r\nms.relay_integration.compile_relay(\r\n    database: Database,\r\n    mod: IRModule,\r\n    target: Union[Target, str],\r\n    params: Optional[Dict[str, NDArray]],\r\n    ...\r\n) -> runtime.Module: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrade guide\r\n### If you are using `ms.tune_relay`\r\n\r\nThe original monolithic API is used as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlib = ms.tune_relay(\r\n    mod=mod,\r\n    target=ARGS.target,\r\n    config=ms.TuneConfig(\r\n        strategy=\"evolutionary\",\r\n        num_trials_per_iter=64,\r\n        max_trials_per_task=ARGS.num_trials,\r\n        max_trials_global=ARGS.num_trials,\r\n        adaptive_training=ARGS.adaptive_training,\r\n    ),\r\n    runner=runner,\r\n    work_dir=ARGS.work_dir,\r\n    params=params,\r\n    backend=ARGS.backend,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the new design is very much similar with 2 notable differences:\r\n- The monolithic API is split into 2 separate APIs\r\n- It no longer requires a second level configuration, i.e. `TuneConfig`\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, the API above should be written as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndatabase = ms.relay_integration.tune_relay(\r\n    mod=mod,\r\n    target=ARGS.target,\r\n    work_dir=ARGS.work_dir,\r\n    max_trials_global=ARGS.num_trials,\r\n    num_trials_per_iter=64,\r\n    params=params,\r\n    runner=runner,\r\n    strategy=\"evolutionary\",\r\n)\r\nlib = ms.relay_integration.compile_relay(\r\n    database=database,\r\n    mod=mod,\r\n    target=ARGS.target,\r\n    params=params,\r\n    backend=ARGS.backend,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease refer to changes in `python/tvm/meta_schedule/testing/tune_relay.py` as a practical case.\r\n\r\n### If you are using `ms.tune_extracted_tasks`\r\n\r\nAs a classic usecase, fluent TVM users may want to extract tasks from Relay first, filter the tasks themselves before sending them to the tuning system. It usually involves 3 APIs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import meta_schedule as ms\r\n\r\n# API 1. Task extraction and filtering\r\nextracted_tasks: List[ExtractedTask] = ms.extract_task_from_relay(relay_mod, target, params)\r\nextracted_tasks = [task for task in extracted_tasks if \"conv2d\" in task.task_name]\r\n\r\n# API 2. Tuning\r\ndatabase = tune_extracted_tasks(\r\n    tune_tasks,\r\n    ms.TuneConfig(...),\r\n    work_dir=work_dir,\r\n    num_threads=32,\r\n    ...,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# API 3. Relay compilation\r\nwith database, tvm.transform.PassContext(\r\n    opt_level=3,\r\n    config={\"relay.backend.use_meta_schedule\": True},\r\n):\r\n    lib = relay.build(relay_mod, target=target, params=params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo provide more flexibility of fine-grained control over the tuning system, we again add an extra API that allows customize the behavior of `ms.ExtractedTask` to `ms.TuneContext` conversion. More specifically, after this refactoring, the APIs are changed into:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# API 1. Task extraction and filtering\r\nextracted_tasks: List[ExtractedTask] = ms.relay_integration.extract_tasks(relay_mod, target, params)\r\nextracted_tasks = [task for task in extracted_tasks if \"conv2d\" in task.task_name]\r\n\r\n# API 2. Convert `ms.ExtractedTask` to `ms.TuneContext`\r\ntasks: List[TuneContext]\r\ntask_weights: List[float]\r\ntasks, task_weights = ms.relay_integration.extracted_tasks_to_tune_contexts(\r\n    extracted_tasks=tune_tasks,\r\n    work_dir=work_dir,\r\n    space=\"post-order-apply\", # gives the flexibility to customize per-task search space\r\n    num_threads=32,\r\n )\r\n\r\n# API 3. Tuning\r\ndatabase = ms.tune.tune_tasks(\r\n    tasks=tasks,\r\n    task_weights=task_weights,\r\n    work_dir=work_dir,\r\n    max_trials_global=20000,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# API 4. Relay compilation\r\nlib = ms.relay_integration.compile_relay(\r\n    database=database,\r\n    mod=mod,\r\n    target=ARGS.target,\r\n    params=params,\r\n    backend=ARGS.backend,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease refer to changes in `tests/python/integration/test_meta_schedule_auto_tensorize.py` as a practical case.\r\n\r\n### Misc changes\r\n\r\n- `blocks` in `tune_tir` is moved to `ms.space.PostOrderApply(f_block_filter=...)`\r\n- `adaptive_training` in `tune_{relay}/{tir}/{extracted_tasks}` is moved to `ms.cost_model.XGBModel(adaptive_training=...)`\r\n- `sch_rules`/`postprocs`/`mutators` in `tune_{relay}/{tir}/{extracted_tasks}` is moved to `ms.space.PostOrderApply(...)`, and when unspecified, a target-specific default is used.\r\n- `default_config.py` is broken down into `tvm::meta_schedule::{ScheduleRule}/{Mutator}/{Postproc}::Default{LLVM}/{CPU}/{CUDA}`.\r\n\r\n### Performance Numbers\r\n\r\nThe PR is tested end-to-end on a

PR fixes cases where a USMP buffer is used with tensorization intrinsics. In these cases, it is common to\r\nwrite schedules that pass Buffers to extern functions using `access_ptr()`. When transforming tir.allocate into\r\noffsets into global_workspace buffers, USMP inserts a let expression that replaces the old Buffer var with a new\r\nvar named \"<buffer_var>_let.\" It then attempts to replace all references to the old var with the new one. When\r\na Buffer was passed via `access_ptr`, USMP would would previously ignore such instances, producing this error\r\nlater on in codegen (dense being the name of the Buffer in use):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"src/target/source/codegen_source_base.cc\", line 67\r\n  Check failed: (it != var_idmap_.end()) is false: Find undefined\r\n    Variable dense\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the problem by replacing the old VarNode with the new one.\r\n\r\ncc @lhutton1 @Mousius @leandron @manupak @mehrdadh

conversions between `_Float16` and `float`, LLVM uses runtime functions `__extendhfsf2` and `__truncsfhf2`.  On X86 up until version 14, LLVM used `uint16_t` for representing `_Float16`. Starting with LLVM 15, half- precision values can be passed in XMM registers (i.e. as floating-point). This happens when the compilation target has SSE2 enabled (either directly, or by enabling a feature that implies SSE2).\r\nBecause the names of the conversion functions remain unchanged, it is impossible for TVM to provide them in the runtime, and have them work in both cases. To solve this issue, emit these functions directly into the target module after detecting whether or not to use floating-point ABI. To allow the linker to remove potential duplicates (or if they are unused), they are weak and reside in a separate

target-specific intrinsics that only support one of int8 or uint8. For example, the x86 VNNI instruction only supports uint8 activation. \r\n\r\nBut the logic is incorrect (two cases are flipped) and leads to incorrect result in the following case:\r\n\r\n* The input activation is int8, and we want to use the x86 VNNI intrinsic which only supports uint8 activations.\r\n* The input activation is uint8, and we want to use the ARM `sdot` intrinsic which only supports int8 activations.\r\n\r\nThe first case also applies to the Hexagon `vrmpy` intrinsic. I found this bug while testing `vrmpy` conv2d on int8 input.\r\n\r\nTo test this on CI, we need to be running on a cascadelake or ARM v8.2 (with dot product support) instance. I cannot find a way to detect such cpu feature from a python script. `try / catch` doesn't work because the error is raised from LLVM (`LLVM ERROR: Do not know how to split the result of this operator`) that I don't know how to catch. So for now the test is skipped. Any suggestion on this? @areusch @driazati \r\n\r\ncc @tkonolige @mbrookhart

commit adds a new sub-analyzer, `TransitiveComparisonAnalyzer`, which attempts to apply multiple known comparisons to prove an unknown.  For example, `a <= b` and `b <= c` imply that `a <= c`. These simplifications are necessary for simplifying conditionals resulting from padded layout transformations (https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/12261).\r\n\r\nWhile some of these conditions may be proven using `ConstIntBoundAnalyzer` or `IntSetAnalyzer`, each has some limitations.  `ConstIntBoundAnalyzer` can only compare against a constant, `IntSetAnalyzer` internally calls `RewriteSimplifier` which can result in infinite recursion, and neither can handle not-equal conditions because it would require tracking multiple intervals per expression.  Therefore, introducing a new sub-analyzer for these

pull request removes a number of restrictions on the usage of the `depthwise_conv2d` schedule for microTVM. It:\r\n- Adds support for the `int16` input data type\r\n- Adds support for arbitrarily-sized (including asymmetric) kernels\r\n- Allows the `int16` version to run on Cortex-M0 and M3 (which do not have SIMD instructions)\r\n  - This is accomplished without performance loss\r\n  - Adds unit tests for these features\r\n \r\nIt also removes use of the `SMLAD` instruction, which cannot improve performance on `NHWC` layouts (discussion about why in the comments below). This results in a slight performance boost for depthwise convolutions where `kernel_width * kernel_height` is odd, and no change otherwise. It also contains some readability improvements.\r\n\r\nKnown issue: [my call to `topi.reshape` in `depthwise_conv2d.py`](https://github.com/guberti/tvm/blob/5bba3d0524491fe74cf33932170110768e35cf43/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/mprofile/dsp/depthwise_conv2d.py#L116) results in useless C code being generated that unnecessarily duplicates an array. The performance hit  from this is small, but it is a gross issue.","created_at":"2022-09-21T10:47:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T11:37:14Z","closed_at":"2022-09-28T21:14:50Z","merged_at":"2022-09-28T21:14:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3a6cb6a1bc1764e261321713ab275461b36dcc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/05978a203749bdab1fe3afa725b74e643e75e669","head":{"label":"guberti:micro/depthwise-weights-reorg","ref":"micro/depthwise-weights-reorg","sha":"05978a203749bdab1fe3afa725b74e643e75e669","user":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371518634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE1MTg2MzQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"guberti/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guberti/tvm","description":"Open

on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12845, this PR adds an initial support for template-free auto tuning on Hexagon.\r\n\r\nTest cases demonstrate:\r\n* Auto-scheduler style, template free tuning for fp16 conv2d in NHWC layout.\r\n* `vrmpy` auto tensorization for TE int8 `dense` (weight pre-packed), achieving 440 GOPs on SD888. \r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n* Due to the issue explained in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12706, `link-params = True`, required by Hexagon, causes identical workloads to be tuned as distinct tasks. So e2d tuning is very slow without the changes from 12706.\r\n* Tuning `nn.dense` essentially requires metaschedule `RewriteLayout` postproc: I found that the memory access pattern of `nn.dense`, `C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[j, k]`, where the `j` axis is vectorized, performs terribly on Hexagon. But the implementation of `RewriteLayout` is completely incompatible with `link-params = True`. Until we fix this, we cannot  enable `RewriteLayout` for Hexagon and hence tuning `nn.dense` (and `nn.batch_matmul`) is not supported for now.\r\n\r\ncc @kparzysz-quic @junrushao @tmoreau89

`MultiLevelTiling`, the size of the loop that is going to be vectorized is completely random. This is not a good fit for backends with wide vector registers such as Hexagon.  \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an extension of `MultiLevelTiling`, to effectively utilize wide vectors. The loop over the innermost spatial axis of the output buffer is always vectorized with the maximum vector length. This makes it possible to auto schedule for Hexagon successfully. \r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @junrushao

PR fixes some of the ongoing problems we're having building docker images after merging #12663 . It links `caffe` into the venv (this was done before, but is now done via the env var) and ensures that cmake will find the venv Python by ensuring that the `python3.7` command resolves to the venv Python. Finally, it builds boost outside the venv so that development files can be found.\r\n\r\n@leandron @driazati

to this PR, the LCA detector of buffers in TIR didn't take buffer memory scopes and GPU hierarchy into consideration. An consequent issue is that, when an intermediate buffer is in global memory, TIR's lowering passes don't necessarily allocated the intermediate buffer outside all `blockIdx`. As a result, the global intermediate buffer is allocated under a GPU thread block, which is illegal.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by fixing the LCA detector, making it be aware of the buffer memory scopes and GPU hierarchy. With this fix, the global intermediate buffers are all allocated outside `blockIdx`.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao @junrushao1994 @spectrometerHBH

from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11269, which allowed schedule arguments of the buffer to be transformed to be specified as a string, or as a `tir::Buffer`.  The string handling worked correctly, but the `tir::Buffer` object was handled incorrectly.  This commit corrects the handling of `tir::Buffer` arguments when scheduling, and adds a unit test to validate this behavior.\n\ncc @Hzfengsy
