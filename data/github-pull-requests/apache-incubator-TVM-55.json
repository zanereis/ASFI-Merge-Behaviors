`TensorizeInfo` structure and `GetTensorizeLoopMapping` function, that are used for determining the correspondence of loops between a target block and an intrinsic description. \r\n\r\nMatching is based on a heuristic: It works in all cases I tested (CPU dot product for dense / conv2d, CPU / GPU matmul), but there is no guarantee that it always finds the \"right\" mapping. If the mapping is not correct, tensorize would fail.\r\n\r\nThe original code is https://github.com/spectrometerHBH/tvm/blob/auto-tensorization/src/tir/schedule/analysis/analysis.cc#L1175, I modified this code to support more cases and added tests. I'm sending this PR on behalf of the team, but most of the work were done by others earlier.  \r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Siyuan Feng [Hzfengsy@sjtu.edu.cn](mailto:Hzfengsy@sjtu.edu.cn)\r\nCo-authored-by:

pull request contains three small changes:\r\n- Fix bug allowing `microTVM` to be used with Arduino version `v0.20` and above (see changes to `_parse_connected_boards`) and adds relevant unit

my onnx model is superpoint. it's converted  from a pytorch model.\r\nWhen I import the model. I get the relay as follow:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n%38 = transpose(%37, axes=[0, 1, 3, 2, 4]);\r\n%39 = reshape(%38, newshape=[1, 480, 640]);\r\n%40 = nn.max_pool2d(%39, pool_size=[9, 9], padding=[4, 4, 4, 4], layout=\"NCW\");\r\n%41 = equal(%39, %40);\r\ncast(%41, dtype=\"float32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe model layer in Netron is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50271153/163803337-e9cb51ff-363b-4533-915e-5a6d7d39701e.png)\r\nThen we can see the %39 reshape is a 3 dimensions. It is legal in pytorch model. But in ONNX, I will get a error.\r\nThen I will add a `expand_dims` before pool2D and a squeeze after pool2D like the code I commited.\r\n\r\nBut i don`t know how to add a unit test case. because there will be error in onnxruntime if the pool2D  shape is 3D.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50271153/163803954-d1987128-f4dd-4ce4-96ad-2a04842b5ed6.png)\r\n\r\ncc: @MatthewARM

situation when generated OpenCL kernel contained the following if\r\ncondition:\r\n```\r\nif (uint4(...) && (int4(...) == int4(...)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, got the following error:\r\n\"can't convert between vector values of different size ('uint4' and 'int __attribute__((ext_vector_type(4)))')\"\r\n\r\nAdded casts for binary ops. But it was necessary to modify `CastFromTo`\r\nand add new method `CastTo`. Because with `CastFromTo` the following\r\ncode was generated:\r\n```\r\nif (uint4(...) && (convert_uint4(int4(...)) == convert_uint4(int4(...))))\r\n```\r\nBut the OpenCL compiler still generated the same error.\r\n\r\nThis is why added new method `CastTo`. In this method we don't check the\r\ncurrent type of op and just add cast to a new type.\r\n\r\nFinally the following code will be generated:\r\n```\r\nif (uint4(...) && convert_uint4(convert_uint4(int4(...)) == convert_uint4(int4(...))))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

observed that VirtualMachine::SetInputTensorWithIndex(...) method has discrepancy between description (also see description for VirtualMachine::SetInput(...) which assumes zero copy if possible and uses the method) and implementation. It always create new NDArray and copies data to it if source input is DLTensor even if devices are the same. It reduces performance of multiple input models due to excess copying. The PR fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nNote: I have a remark about current design. VirtualMachine has only `set_input` python method, the same method is used inside `run` and `invoke` methods with input args. But there is no `set_input_zero_copy`. In description I obsrved that `set_input` tries to not use copying if possible. Theoretically we can have problem if `set_input` is used, input tensors are released after that and when `run` or `invoke` are launched. As I know GraphExecutor does not have such

to this commit, the BufferAllocationLocator mutator used in the PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation pass would erroneously insert an entry to `BlockNode::alloc_buffers` for buffers allocated using `Allocate` or `AllocateConst` nodes.  This error was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9727, which deprecated `Load` and `Store` nodes, replacing them with `BufferLoad` and `BufferStore` nodes.  As a result, BufferAllocationLocator identified these as buffers whose allocations should be moved to inner loops, rather than as unmanaged allocations that should be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis commit restores the earlier behavior by only operating on buffer allocations in `BlockNode::alloc_buffers`, and explicitly ignoring any buffers whose allocation is done with `Allocate` or

there is no way to pass an output module name to tvmc on the command line when compiling a model.\r\nThis means that (for the use cases we are interested in) generated C code is always placed in files named `default_lib*.c` and that functions are named `tvmgen_default*()`.\r\nIf we want to compile multiple models for use with a single application, the C source file names and function names are not unique, resulting in failure when building the generated C code.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows module-name to be passed to tvmc on the command line, for example:\r\n```\r\ntvmc compile --target=cmsis-nn,c \\\r\n    --target-cmsis-nn-mcpu=cortex-m55 \\\r\n    --runtime=crt \\\r\n    --executor=aot \\\r\n    --executor-aot-interface-api=c \\\r\n    --executor-aot-unpacked-api=1 \\\r\n    --pass-config tir.usmp.enable=1 \\\r\n    --pass-config tir.usmp.algorithm=hill_climb \\\r\n    --pass-config tir.disable_storage_rewrite=1 \\\r\n    --pass-config tir.disable_vectorize=1 ./mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_INT8.tflite \\\r\n    --output-format=mlf \\\r\n    --module-name=classify\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the generated C code is placed in files named `classify_lib*.c` and functions are named `tvmgen_classify*()`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR updates the microNPU and CMSIS-NN graph partitioners to pass the module name to PartitionGraph().\r\nThis is necessary to ensure that the C code function names generated for microNPU and CMSIS-NN include the module name and not `default`.\r\n\r\n@leandron @Mousius @manupa-arm @areusch \r\n\n\ncc
