Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBackported from [pr#27079](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27079). For a partitioned table, if the number of partitions are very large, e.g. tens of thousands or even larger, calculating its total size causes flooding logs.\r\nThe flooding happens in:\r\n1. `calculateLocationSize` prints the starting and ending for calculating the location size, and it is called per partition;\r\n2. `bulkListLeafFiles` prints all partition paths.\r\n\r\nThis pr is to simplify the logging when calculating the size of a partitioned table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnot

This means that the number of slots each executor has could be calculated from the number of cores and task cpus just as is done today.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the line of development we relaxed that and only warn when we are wasting resources. This breaks the dynamic allocation logic if the limiting resource is no longer the cores because its using the cores and task cpus to calculate the number of executors it needs.  This means we will request less executors then we really need to run everything. We have to enforce that cores is always the limiting resource so we should throw if its not.\r\n\r\nThe only issue with us enforcing this is on cluster managers (standalone and mesos coarse grained) where we don't know the executor cores up front by default. Meaning the spark.executor.cores config defaults to 1 but when the executor is started by default it gets all the cores of the Worker. So we have to add logic specifically to handle that and we can't enforce this requirements, we can just warn when dynamic allocation is enabled for those.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Note I didn't update tests for `ignoreCorruptFiles`, because  there're various datasources has tests for `ignoreCorruptFiles`. So I'm not sure if it's worth to touch all those tests since the basic logic of `ignoreCorruptFiles` should be same with `ignoreMissingFiles`.","created_at":"2020-01-08T14:39:11Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T02:17:35Z","closed_at":"2020-01-09T19:35:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f44df6a87a37b959585cc4d8d9730c277c10290","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/afef6ad4119791eae2f889a478f1064752cac840","head":{"label":"Ngone51:improve-missing-files","ref":"improve-missing-files","sha":"afef6ad4119791eae2f889a478f1064752cac840","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd config \"spark.sql.statistics.fallBackToFs.maxPartitionNumber\" and use it to control whether calculate statistics through file system.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, when spark need to calculate the statistics (eg. sizeInBytes) of table partition through file system (eg. HDFS), it does not consider the number of partitions. Then if the the number of partitions is huge, it will cost much time to calculate the statistics which may be not be that useful.\r\n\r\nIt should be reasonable to add a config item to control the limit of partition number allowable to calculate statistics through file system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, statistics of logical plan may be changed which may impact some spark strategies part, eg. JoinSelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-08T05:43:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-30T00:20:48Z","closed_at":"2020-05-30T00:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21850343597582d94094ef37aa90e7d4dd895fba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b14ce4435dfa6fb5114385bb122ec9a86ca7213","head":{"label":"fuwhu:SPARK-30427","ref":"SPARK-30427","sha":"8b14ce4435dfa6fb5114385bb122ec9a86ca7213","user":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42981239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk4MTIzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"fuwhu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrevent the filtering on dropped columns.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, analyzer rule `ResolveMissingReferences` adds the dropped column because drop is the partial implementation of Project and while applying rule it cannot distinguish between Project added by dropped. This PR reconstructs a dataframe for drop command.\r\nSee discussion in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30421\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-08T05:20:50Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T09:34:31Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T06:14:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ee4fe68eb1d0316770629d1bf50035c5cbb2479","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

In standalone mode if the value is not explicitly set by default, the conf value would be 1 but the executor would actually use all the cores of the worker. So it is allowed to have `CPUS_PER_TASK` greater than `EXECUTOR_CORES`. To handle this case, we change the condition to be `numTasks <= Math.max(conf.get(EXECUTOR_CORES) / sched.CPUS_PER_TASK, 1)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Even though there is only 1 task in the stage it would not be speculative run.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nSolve the problem above by allowing speculative run when there is only 1 task in the stage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up to address the following comment: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27095#discussion_r363152180\r\n\r\nCurrently, a SQL command string is parsed to a \"statement\" logical plan, converted to a logical plan with catalog/namespace, then finally converted to a physical plan. With the new resolution framework, there is no need to create a \"statement\" logical plan; a logical plan can contain `UnresolvedNamespace` which will be resolved to a `ResolvedNamespace`. This should simply the code base and make it a bit easier to add a new command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nClean up codebase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis excludes the .git folder when the python linter runs.  We want to exclude because there may be files in .git from other branches that could cause the linter to fail. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI ran into a case where there was a branch name that ended \".py\" suffix so there were git refs files in .git folder in .git/logs/refs and .git/refs/remotes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual.\r\n```\r\n$ git branch 3.py\r\n$ git checkout 3.py\r\nSwitched to branch '3.py'\r\n$ dev/lint-python\r\nstarting python compilation test...\r\nPython compilation

stacktrace shows it fails at `transformUp` on `objSerializer` in `ExpressionEncoder`. In particular, it fails at initializing `ValidateExternalType.errMsg`, that interpolates `catalogString` of given `expected` data type in a string. In WideSchemaBenchmark we have very deeply nested data type. When we transform on the serializer which contains `ValidateExternalType`, we create redundant big string `errMsg`. Because we just in transforming it and don't use it yet, it is useless and waste a lot of memory.\r\n\r\nAfter make `ValidateExternalType.errMsg` as lazy variable, WideSchemaBenchmark works.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

time the outer while loop executes. although just once per do-while loop after,  but it does reduce a lot of recomputation；because every time it jump out of the do-while loop，there are no vertices have only out-degree or in-degree，so it's no need to recompute degree and tag the vertices true.\r\n\r\nfor example，the Email-EuAll  data set：http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-EuAll.html\r\n\r\ndo-while loop execute 10 times，and the reduce logic happend 2 times；so it would be helpful when computing StronglyConnectedComponents to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users to specify NOT NULL in CREATE TABLE and ADD COLUMN column definition, and add a new SQL syntax to alter column nullability: ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN SET/DROP NOT NULL. This is a SQL standard syntax:\r\n```\r\n<alter column definition> ::=\r\n  ALTER [ COLUMN ] <column name> <alter column action>\r\n\r\n<alter column action> ::=\r\n    <set column default clause>\r\n  | <drop column default clause>\r\n  | <set column not null clause>\r\n  | <drop column not null clause>\r\n  | ...\r\n\r\n<set column not null clause> ::=\r\n  SET NOT NULL\r\n\r\n<drop column not null clause> ::=\r\n  DROP NOT NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPreviously we don't support it because the table schema in hive catalog are always nullable. Since we have catalog plugin now, it makes more sense to support NOT NULL at spark side, and let catalog implementations to decide if they support it or not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this is a new feature\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move pandas related functionalities into pandas package. Namely:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npyspark/sql/pandas\r\n├── __init__.py\r\n├── conversion.py  # Conversion between pandas <> PySpark DataFrames\r\n├── functions.py   # pandas_udf\r\n├── group_ops.py   # Grouped UDF / Cogrouped UDF + groupby.apply, groupby.cogroup.apply\r\n├── map_ops.py     # Map Iter UDF + mapInPandas\r\n├── serializers.py # pandas <> PyArrow serializers\r\n├── types.py       # Type utils between pandas <> PyArrow\r\n└── utils.py       # Version requirement checks\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to separately locate `groupby.apply`, `groupby.cogroup.apply`, `mapInPandas`, `toPandas`, and `createDataFrame(pdf)` under `pandas` sub-package, I had to use a mix-in approach which Scala side uses often by `trait`, and also pandas itself uses this approach (see `IndexOpsMixin` as an example) to group related functionalities. Currently, you can think it's like Scala's self typed trait. See the structure below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass PandasMapOpsMixin(object):\r\n    def mapInPandas(self, ...):\r\n        ...\r\n        return ...\r\n\r\n    # other Pandas <> PySpark APIs\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass DataFrame(PandasMapOpsMixin):\r\n\r\n    # other DataFrame APIs equivalent to Scala side.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, This is a big PR but they are mostly just moving around except one case `createDataFrame` which I had to split the methods.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are pandas functionalities here and there and I myself gets lost where it was. Also, when you have to make a change commonly for all of pandas related features, it's almost impossible now.\r\n\r\nAlso, after this change, `DataFrame` and `SparkSession` become more consistent with Scala side since pandas is specific to Python, and this change separates pandas-specific APIs away from `DataFrame` or `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover. Also, I manually built the PySpark API documentation and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to follow the rule of create table for Hive table instead of normal table.\r\n\r\nThere're two major statements on supporting create table (createTable / createHiveTable in SqlBase.g4). As we support external table only for Hive table, the code seems to only allow `external` in createHiveTable which is only determined when there's any unique option for Hive in create table clauses, which is breaking change and don't seem to be intuitive.\r\n\r\nAs we only support external table for Hive table, we could simplify the parser rule via always referring Hive table for \"CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE\". We no longer need to verify createTable to check whether `external` is available.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ... LOCATION` is broken, and it doesn't make sense to let end users specify the unique option only available for Hive table to make it work.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nMaybe yes, given the changes:\r\n\r\n* CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE will always be considered as Hive table.\r\n  * It doesn't allow to provide \"USING\", unlike CREATE TABLE.\r\n  * CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE uses same createTableClauses as Hive table, instead of normal table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UTs. Jenkins build passed.","created_at":"2020-01-06T12:50:21Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T01:19:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T01:09:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d0c87198263748494ceeb1226865e3b65f8ccb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27107/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27107/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27107/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f9e033d8d18678e4ef5a08aa30a7af1a5aeb60b","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-30436","ref":"SPARK-30436","sha":"3f9e033d8d18678e4ef5a08aa30a7af1a5aeb60b","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n \r\nadd supported hive features\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nupdate doc\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nBefore change UI info:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/72592726-29302c80-393e-11ea-8f4d-76432d4cb658.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this

How was this patch tested?\r\nFor PR about Spark Doc Web UI, we need to show UI format before and after pr.\r\nWe can build our local web server about spark docs with reference `$SPARK_PROJECT/docs/README.md`\r\n\r\nYou should install python and ruby in your env and also install plugin like below\r\n```sh\r\n$ sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-redirect-from rouge\r\n# Following is needed only for generating API docs\r\n$ sudo pip install sphinx pypandoc mkdocs\r\n$ sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages(c(\"knitr\", \"devtools\", \"rmarkdown\"), repos=\"https://cloud.r-project.org/\")'\r\n$ sudo Rscript -e 'devtools::install_version(\"roxygen2\", version = \"5.0.1\", repos=\"https://cloud.r-project.org/\")'\r\n$ sudo Rscript -e 'devtools::install_version(\"testthat\", version = \"1.0.2\", repos=\"https://cloud.r-project.org/\")'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we call  `jekyll serve --watch` after build we see below message\r\n```\r\n~/Documents/project/AngersZhu/spark/sql\r\nMoving back into docs dir.\r\nMaking directory api/sql\r\ncp -r ../sql/site/. api/sql\r\n            Source:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to make conflict attributes resolution in `ResolveReferences` more scalable by doing resolution in batch way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, `ResolveReferences` rule only resolves conflict attributes of one single conflict plan pair in one iteration, which can be inefficient when there're many conflicts. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake GBT reuse splits/treePoints for all trees:\r\n1, reuse splits/treePoints for all trees:\r\nexisting impl will find feature splits and transform input vectors to treePoints for each tree; while other famous impls like XGBoost/lightGBM will build a global splits/binned features and reuse them for all trees; \r\nNote: the sampling rate in existing impl to build `splits` is not the param `subsamplingRate` but the output of `RandomForest.samplesFractionForFindSplits` which depends on `maxBins` and `numExamples`.\r\nNote II: Existing impl do not guarantee that splits among iteration are the same, so this may cause a little difference in convergence.\r\n\r\n2, do not cache input vectors:\r\nexisting impl will cached the input twice: 1,`input: RDD[Instance]` is used to compute/update prediction and errors; 2, at each iteration, input is transformed to bagged points, the bagged points will be cached during this iteration;\r\nIn this PR,`input: RDD[Instance]` is no longer cached, since it is only used three times: 1, compute metadata; 2, find splits; 3, converted to treePoints;\r\nInstead, the treePoints `RDD[TreePoint]` is cached, at each iter, it is convert to bagged points by attaching extra `labelWithCounts: RDD[(Double, Int)]` containing residuals/sampleCount information, this rdd is relative small (like cached `norms` in KMeans);\r\nTo compute/update prediction and errors, new prediction method based on binned features are added in `Node`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor perfermance

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `SqlBase.g4`, the `comment` clause is used as `COMMENT comment=STRING` and `COMMENT STRING` in many places.\r\n\r\nWhile the `location` clause often appears along with the `comment` clause with a pattern defined as\r\n```sql\r\nlocationSpec\r\n    : LOCATION STRING\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\nThen, we have to visit `locationSpec` as a `List` but comment as a single token.\r\n\r\nWe defined `commentSpec` for the comment clause to simplify and unify the grammar and the invocations. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo simplify the grammar.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation operations.\r\n\r\nCase A:\r\nApplication appA insert overwrite table table_a with static partition overwrite.\r\nBut it was killed when committing tasks, because one task is hang.\r\nAnd parts of its committed tasks output is kept under /path/table_a/_temporary/0/.\r\n\r\nThen we rerun appA. It will reuse the staging dir /path/table_a/_temporary/0/.\r\nIt executes successfully.\r\nBut it also commit the data reminded by killed application to destination dir.\r\n\r\nCase B:\r\n\r\nApplication appA insert overwrite table table_a.\r\n\r\nApplication appB insert overwrite table table_a, too.\r\n\r\nThey execute concurrently, and they may all use /path/table_a/_temporary/0/ as workPath.\r\n\r\nAnd their result may be corruptted.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we set a staging output path for InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation operation.\r\n\r\nThe output path is a multi level path and is composed of specified partition key-value pairs formatted .spark-staging-${depth}/p1=v1/p2=v2/.../pn=vn.\r\n\r\nWe can detect the conflict by checking the existence of relative staging output path.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\ntable_a(c1 string, a string, b string,...) partitioned by (a, b , ...)\r\n\r\nWhen writing to partition a=1, we need to check the existence of\r\n\r\n.spark-staging-0\r\n.spark-staging-1/a=1\r\n.spark-staging-2/a=1\r\n...\r\n.spark-staging-numPartitions/a=1\r\nWhen we found relative staging output path is existed, an exception would be thrown.\r\n\r\nBesides, we propose an operation liveness detection mechanism to automatically detect whether an operation is running based on hdfs lease mechanism.\r\n\r\nThanks @advancedxy for providing the prototype of solution and valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nData may be corrupted without this PR.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUser can see the exists of staging output path and may need clean up these path manually, when this path is belong to a killed application and has not been cleaned up gracefully.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test.","created_at":"2020-01-06T07:17:56Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T00:13:34Z","closed_at":"2020-05-17T00:13:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0db73ce5661b433f502196a57cc2488ea4b30af4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExtra shuffling was not eliminated after inner joins because they produce PartitioningCollection Partitioning and the current logic only matched on HashPartitioning. \r\n\r\nNothing was present in EnsureRequirements to eliminate parent sorting (within partitions) which was unnecessary when the same sort order was introduced by sortmergejoin\r\n\r\nCopied from jira:\r\nPartitioning & sorting is usually retained after join.\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set('spark.sql.shuffle.partitions', '42')\r\n\r\ndf1 = spark.range(5000000,

warning.","created_at":"2020-01-03T16:29:15Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:42:09Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T01:32:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70953b168483dd3b0213bcd6f58710115fcdaa7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/faf88e8f461842e1b7a549088ebcacf0ec8e4cae","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:group-deprecated-sql-configs","ref":"group-deprecated-sql-configs","sha":"faf88e8f461842e1b7a549088ebcacf0ec8e4cae","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument updated for `CACHE TABLE` & `UNCACHE TABLE`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCache table creates a temp view while caching data using `CACHE TABLE name AS query`. `UNCACHE TABLE` does not remove this temp view. \r\n\r\nThese things were not mentioned in the existing doc for `CACHE TABLE` & `UNCACHE TABLE`.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nDocument updated for `CACHE TABLE` & `UNCACHE TABLE` command.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements multiple performance optimizations for `ParquetRowConverter`, achieving some modest constant-factor wins for all fields and larger wins for map and array fields: \r\n\r\n- Add `private[this]` to several `val`s (90cebf080a5d3857ea8cf2a89e8e060b8b5a2fbf)\r\n- Keep a `fieldUpdaters` array, saving two`.updater()` calls per field (7318785d350cc924198d7514e40973fd76d54ad5): I suspect that these are often megamorphic calls, so cutting these out seems like it could be a relatively large performance win.\r\n- Only call `currentRow.numFields` once per `start()` call (e05de150813b639929c18af1df09ec718d2d16fc): previously we'd call it once per field and this had a significant enough cost that it was visible during profiling.\r\n- Reuse buffers in array and map converters (c7d1534685fbad5d2280b082f37bed6d75848e76, 6d16f596ef6af9fd8946a062f79d0eeace9e1959): previously we would create a brand-new Scala `ArrayBuffer` for each field read, but this isn't actually necessary because the data is already copied into a fresh array when `end()` constructs a `GenericArrayData`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo improve Parquet read performance; this is complementary to #26993's (orthogonal) improvements for nested struct read performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`GenericArrayData` has a `this(seqOrArray: Any)` constructor, which was originally added in #13138 for use in `RowEncoder` (where we may not know concrete types until runtime) but is also called (perhaps unintentionally) in a few other code paths.\r\n\r\nIn this constructor's existing implementation, a call to `new WrappedArray(Array[Object](\"\"))` is dispatched to the `this(seqOrArray: Any)` constructor, where we then call `this(array.toSeq)`: this wraps the provided array into a `WrappedArray`, which is subsequently unwrapped in a `this(seq.toArray)` call. For an interactive example, see https://scastie.scala-lang.org/7jOHydbNTaGSU677FWA8nA\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `this(seqOrArray: Any)` constructor so that it calls the primary `this(array: Array[Any])` constructor, allowing us to save a `.toSeq.toArray` call; this comes at the cost of one additional `case` in the `match` statement (but I believe this has a negligible performance impact relative to the other savings).\r\n\r\nAs code cleanup, I also reverted the JVM 1.7 workaround from #14271.\r\n\r\nI also fixed a related performance problem in `ParquetRowConverter`: previously, this code called `ArrayBasedMapData.apply` which, in turn, called the `this(Any)` constructor for `GenericArrayData`: this PR's micro-benchmarks show that this is _significantly_ slower than calling the `this(Array[Any])` constructor (and I also observed time spent here during other Parquet scan benchmarking work). To fix this performance problem, I replaced the call to the  `ArrayBasedMapData.apply` method with direct calls to the `ArrayBasedMapData` and `GenericArrayData` constructors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI tested this by running code in a debugger and by running microbenchmarks (which I've added to a new `GenericArrayDataBenchmark` in this PR):\r\n\r\n- With JDK8 benchmarks: this PR's changes more than double the performance of calls to the `this(Any)` constructor. Even after improvements, however, calls to the `this(Array[Any])` constructor are still ~60x faster than calls to `this(Any)` when passing a non-primitive array (thereby motivating this patch's other change in `ParquetRowConverter`).\r\n- With JDK11 benchmarks: the changes more-or-less completely eliminate the performance penalty associated with the `this(Any)`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is the part 3 of SPARK-29779 and addresses remaining functionality: integrate compaction into FsHistoryProvider. This patch also addresses documentation about new configuration. Please refer the description of PR #27085 to see overall rationalization of this patch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of major goal of SPARK-28594 is to prevent the event logs to become too huge, and SPARK-29779 achieves the goal. We've got another approach in prior, but the old approach required models in both KVStore and live entities to guarantee compatibility, while they're not designed to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT. Manual test will follow once earlier parts are merged and this patch is rebased.","created_at":"2020-01-03T06:31:08Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T04:32:00Z","closed_at":"2020-01-15T04:31:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f50b5904a5dd49686c0fbd8bb085a811da79531","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4bade08ec3cda895e16918c7a94a664316c5f885","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-29779-part3","ref":"SPARK-29779-part3","sha":"4bade08ec3cda895e16918c7a94a664316c5f885","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is the part 2 of SPARK-29779 and only addresses adding filter to handle SQL related events. Please refer the description of PR #27085 to see overall rationalization of this patch.\r\n\r\nBelow functionalities will be addressed in later parts:\r\n\r\n* integrate compaction into FsHistoryProvider\r\n* documentation about new configuration\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of major goal of SPARK-28594 is to prevent the event logs to become too huge, and SPARK-29779 achieves the goal. We've got another approach in prior, but the old approach required models in both KVStore and live entities to guarantee compatibility, while they're not designed to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to compact old event log files when end users enable rolling event log, and clean up these files after compaction. \r\n\r\nHere the \"compaction\" really mean is filtering out listener events for finished/removed things - like jobs which take most of space for event log file except SQL related events. To achieve this, compactor does two phases reading: 1) tracking the live jobs (and more to add) 2) filtering events via leveraging the information about live things and rewriting to the \"compacted\" file.\r\n\r\nThis approach retains the ability of compatibility on event log file and adds the possibility of reducing the overall size of event logs. There's a downside here as well: executor metrics for tasks would be inaccurate, as compactor will filter out the task events which job is finished, but I don't feel it as a blocker.\r\n\r\nPlease note that SPARK-29779 leaves below functionalities for future JIRA issue as the patch for SPARK-29779 is too huge and we decided to break down:\r\n\r\n* apply filter in SQL events\r\n* integrate compaction into FsHistoryProvider\r\n* documentation about new configuration\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of major goal of SPARK-28594 is to prevent the event logs to become too huge, and SPARK-29779 achieves the goal. We've got another approach in prior, but the old approach required models in both KVStore and live entities to guarantee compatibility, while they're not designed to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.","created_at":"2020-01-03T04:09:30Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T08:02:40Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T17:53:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"142dc3072f09c75197107e1ce7943ec75c975d5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/163bda018d054a0d41e983e6c448ce3b3e746d35","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-29779-part1","ref":"SPARK-29779-part1","sha":"163bda018d054a0d41e983e6c448ce3b3e746d35","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

showed up (at least) when using encryption, because the commons-crypto\r\nStreamInput class does not track EOF internally, leaving it for the wrapped\r\nstream to behave correctly.\r\n\r\nTested with

Spark History Server is generating a redirect response.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is needed to address bug SPARK-27996 in History Server. Please note that similar change is likely needed in Spark UI. The scope of this PR is only to address the problem in History Server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, the Spark History server deployed in Kubernetes now correctly opens the job page.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested by building and deploying Spark History Server to Kubernetes cluster and then observing the behavior of the History Server UI. The regression testing was not performed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor a partitioned table, if the number of partitions are very large, e.g. tens of thousands or even larger, calculating its total size causes flooding logs.\r\nThe flooding happens in:\r\n1. `calculateLocationSize` prints the starting and ending for calculating the location size, and it is called per partition;\r\n2. `bulkListLeafFiles` prints all partition paths.\r\n\r\nThis pr is to simplify the logging when calculating the size of a partitioned table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnot

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace `.collect()`, `.count()` and `.foreach(_ => ())` in SQL benchmarks and use the `NoOp` datasource. I added an implicit class to `SqlBasedBenchmark` with the `.noop()` method. It can be used in benchmark like: `ds.noop()`. The last one is unfolded to `ds.write.format(\"noop\").mode(Overwrite).save()`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid additional overhead that `collect()` (and other actions) has. For example, `.collect()` has to convert values according to external types and pull data to the driver. This can hide actual performance regressions or improvements of benchmarked operations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRe-run all modified benchmarks using Amazon EC2.\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance | r3.xlarge (spot instance) |\r\n| AMI | ami-06f2f779464715dc5 (ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-20190722.1) |\r\n| Java | OpenJDK8/11 |\r\n\r\n- Run `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` using instructions from the PR #26049\r\n```\r\n# `spark-tpcds-datagen` needs this.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix defect [SPARK-30408](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30408) in EliminateSorts:  orderBy in sortBy clause was removed by EliminateSorts.\r\ncode to reproduce:\r\n```\r\nval dataset = Seq( (\"a\", 1, 4), (\"b\", 2, 5), (\"b2\", 2, 2), (\"c\", 3, 6) ).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") \r\nval groupData = dataset.orderBy(\"b\")\r\nval sortData = groupData.sortWithinPartitions(\"c\")\r\n```\r\nThe content of groupData is:\r\n```\r\npartition 0: \r\n    [a,1,4]\r\npartition 1: \r\n    [b,2,5]\r\n    [b2,2,2]\r\npartition 2: \r\n    [c,3,6]\r\n```\r\nThe content of sortData is:\r\n```\r\npartition 0: \r\n    [a,1,4]\r\n    [b,2,5]\r\npartition 1: \r\n    [b2,2,2]\r\n    [c,3,6]\r\n```\r\nThe content of sortData is not correct because the repartition operator introduced by orderBy was removed by EliminateSorts.\r\nThe content of sortData should be.\r\n```\r\npartition 0: \r\n    [a,1,4]\r\npartition 1: \r\n    [b2,2,2]\r\n    [b,2,5]\r\npartition 2: \r\n    [c,3,6]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR fixed defect [SPARK-30408](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30408).\r\nWithout this fix, the partition of \r\n    ```rdd.orderBy(\"b\").sortWithinPartitions(\"c\")```\r\nis same as \r\n    ```rdd.sortWithinPartitions(\"c\")```\r\nwhich is not correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI add an UT in ```EliminateSortsSuite``` to test this patch.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-02T13:12:19Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T03:13:12Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T02:25:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a7a4104e1f24785b2b9c43042281925d9a9300a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92dce7e96d60b667961c9af12e716b83237d8ca8","head":{"label":"apapi:ap-fixOrderBySortBy","ref":"ap-fixOrderBySortBy","sha":"92dce7e96d60b667961c9af12e716b83237d8ca8","user":{"login":"apapi","id":13774407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzc0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13774407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi","html_url":"https://github.com/apapi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95418998,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTQxODk5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apapi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apapi","id":13774407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzc0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13774407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi","html_url":"https://github.com/apapi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apapi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apapi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is based on #23921 but revised to be simpler, as well as adds UT to test the behavior.\r\n(This patch contains the commit from #23921 to retain credit.)\r\n\r\nSpark loads new JARs for `ADD JAR` and `CREATE FUNCTION ... USING JAR` into jar classloader in shared state, and changes current thread's context classloader to jar classloader as many parts of remaining codes rely on current thread's context classloader.\r\n\r\nThis would work if the further queries will run in same thread and there's no change on context classloader for the thread, but once the context classloader of current thread is switched back by various reason, Spark fails to create instance of class for the function.\r\n\r\nThis bug mostly affects spark-shell, as spark-shell will roll back current thread's context classloader at every prompt. But it may also affects the case of job-server, where the queries may be running in multiple threads.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue via switching the context classloader to the classloader which loads the class. Hopefully FunctionBuilder created by `makeFunctionBuilder` has the information of Class as a part of closure, hence the Class itself can be provided regardless of current thread's context classloader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, end users cannot execute Hive UDF using JAR twice in spark-shell.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. For `ScanOperation`, if it collects more than one filters, then all filters must be deterministic. And filter can be non-deterministic iff there's only one collected filter.\r\n\r\n2. `FileSourceStrategy` should filter out non-deterministic filter, as it will hit haven't initialized exception if it's a partition related filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nStrictly follow `CombineFilters`'s behavior which doesn't allow combine two filters where non-deterministic predicates exist. And avoid hitting exception for file source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* When a task fails due to ```FetchFailedException```, its index is recorded in ```fetchFailedIndex```.\r\n\r\n  * Its log is ```\"INFO TaskSetManager: Task ${info.id} in stage ${taskSet.id} (TID $tid) failed (because the task failed with a shuffle data fetch failure, so the previous stage needs to be re-run).\"```\r\n\r\n  * If another task of the same ```TaskSet``` finishes successfully (e.g., a speculative task which was launched before ```FetchFailedException```, then succeed), the index will be removed from ```fetchFailedIndex```. And the log of the successful task is:\r\n    ```\"INFO TaskSetManager: Finished task 1.1 in stage 1.0 (TID 3) in 10000 ms on 9.76.13.26 (executor 2) (2/2)\"```, \r\n    instead of\r\n    ```\"INFO TaskSetManager: Ignoring task-finished event for 1.1 in stage 1.0 because task 1 has already completed successfully\"```.\r\n\r\n\r\n  * If another task of another ```TaskSet``` attempt of this stage succeed, the index will also be removed from ```fetchFailedIndex```.\r\n\r\n\r\n* If a task succeed, and then its copy task fails, the log of the latter failed task is\r\n  ```\"INFO TaskSetManager: Task ${info.id} in stage ${taskSet.id} (TID $tid) failed (but a different copy of the task has already succeeded).\"```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe should output correct and more accurate log information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\ntest manually, and verify output logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-02T07:14:56Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T06:15:02Z","closed_at":"2020-04-10T06:14:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e4df2f0d0ee367fea7256f59979b728aac610c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, fix `BaggedPoint.convertToBaggedRDD` when `subsamplingRate < 1.0`\r\n2, reorg `RandomForest.runWithMetadata` btw\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn GBT, Instance weights will be discarded if subsamplingRate<1\r\n\r\n1, `baggedPoint: BaggedPoint[TreePoint]` is used in the tree growth to find best split;\r\n2, `BaggedPoint[TreePoint]` contains two weights:\r\n```scala\r\nclass BaggedPoint[Datum](val datum: Datum, val subsampleCounts: Array[Int], val sampleWeight: Double = 1.0)\r\nclass TreePoint(val label: Double, val binnedFeatures: Array[Int], val weight: Double)\r\n```\r\n3, only the var `sampleWeight` in `BaggedPoint` is used, the var `weight` in `TreePoint` is never used in finding splits;\r\n4, The method  `BaggedPoint.convertToBaggedRDD` was changed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21632, it was only for decisiontree, so only the following code path was changed; \r\n```\r\nif (numSubsamples == 1 && subsamplingRate == 1.0) {\r\n        convertToBaggedRDDWithoutSampling(input, extractSampleWeight)\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n5, In https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25926, I made GBT support weights, but only test it with default `subsamplingRate==1`.\r\nGBT with `subsamplingRate<1` will convert treePoints to baggedPoints via\r\n```scala\r\nconvertToBaggedRDDSamplingWithoutReplacement(input, subsamplingRate, numSubsamples, seed)\r\n```\r\nin which the orignial weights from `weightCol` will be discarded and all `sampleWeight` are assigned default 1.0;\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nupdated

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to support push down for filters with cast expression(this one decimal only). The basic idea is, for filters like `Filter(Cast(d as vType) = Literal(v, vType))`, we translate them into `Filter(d = castLiteral(v, d.dataType))` and push down the latter one instead.\r\n\r\nFor example, assuming that column `d` has the type of `DecimalType(9, 2)`:\r\n\r\nfor `Filter(cast(d, Decimal(9, 3)) = 1000.000)`, we push down `EqualTo(d, 1000.00)`\r\nfor `Filter(cast(d, Decimal(9, 3)) > 123.456)`, we push down `GreaterThanOrEqual(d, 123.45)`\r\nfor `Filter(cast(d, Boolean) = false)`, we push down `EqualTo(d, 0.00)`\r\nfor `Filter(cast(d, Int) = 1)`, we push down `And(GreaterThanOrEqual(d, 1.00), LessThan(2.00))`\r\n\r\nAnd those catalyst filters must be added to post-scan filters since we may do an approximate translation for these filters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark doesn't support push down for filters with cast expression, which may result in weird behavior. For example,\r\n```\r\nspark.range(10000000).selectExpr(\"id\", \"cast(id as decimal(9)) as d1\", \"cast(id as decimal(9, 2)) as d2\", \"cast(id as decimal(18)) as d3\", \"cast(id as decimal(18, 4)) as d4\", \"cast(id as decimal(38)) as d5\", \"cast(id as decimal(38, 18)) as d6\").coalesce(1).write.option(\"parquet.block.size\", 1048576).parquet(\"/tmp/spark/parquet/decimal\")\r\nval df = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/spark/parquet/decimal/\")\r\n// query1\r\ndf.filter(\"d2 = 10000.00\").show\r\n// query2\r\ndf.filter(\"d2 = 10000.000\").show\r\n```\r\nIn this case, `query1` could push down the filter into datasource while `query2` couldn't. This happens because column `d2`'s scale(2) doesn't match the literal's scale(3). Thus, Spark will cast `d2` in `TypeCoercion`.\r\n\r\nActually, we can do some specific translation to allow these filters push down to reduce input records from datasources. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTODO unit tests.\r\n\r\n(did some manually tests locally which seems good from the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new `withField` method to the `Column` class. This method should allow users to add or replace a `StructField` in a `StructType` column (with very similar semantics to the `withColumn` method on `Dataset`). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOften Spark users have to work with deeply nested data e.g. to fix a data quality issue with an existing `StructField`. To do this with the existing Spark APIs, users have to rebuild the entire struct column. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have the following deeply nested data structure which has a data quality issue (`5` is missing): \r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n\r\nval data = spark.createDataFrame(sc.parallelize(\r\n      Seq(Row(Row(Row(1, 2, 3), Row(Row(4, null, 6), Row(7, 8, 9), Row(10, 11, 12)), Row(13, 14, 15))))),\r\n      StructType(Seq(\r\n        StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n          StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n          StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))), \r\n            StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n          ))), \r\n          StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n        )))))).cache\r\n\r\ndata.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------+                                             \r\n|a                                |\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4,, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]|\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nCurrently, to replace the missing value users would have to do something like this: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", \r\n  struct(\r\n    $\"a.a\", \r\n    struct(\r\n      struct(\r\n        $\"a.b.a.a\", \r\n        lit(5).as(\"b\"), \r\n        $\"a.b.a.c\"\r\n      ).as(\"a\"), \r\n      $\"a.b.b\", \r\n      $\"a.b.c\"\r\n    ).as(\"b\"), \r\n    $\"a.c\"\r\n  ))\r\n\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nAs you can see above, with the existing methods users must call the `struct` function and list all fields, including fields they don't want to change. This is not ideal as: \r\n>this leads to complex, fragile code that cannot survive schema evolution. \r\n[SPARK-16483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16483)\r\n\r\nIn contrast, with the method added in this PR, a user could simply do something like this: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", 'a.withField(\"b.a.b\", lit(5)))\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the first of maybe a few methods that could be added to the `Column` class to make it easier to manipulate nested data. Other methods under discussion in [SPARK-22231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22231) include `drop` and `renameField`. However, these should be added in a separate PR. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnsure that all StreamStates are removed from OneForOneStreamManager memory map even if there's an error trying to release buffers\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOneForOneStreamManager may not remove all StreamStates from memory map when a connection is terminated. A RuntimeException might be thrown in StreamState$buffers.next() by one of ExternalShuffleBlockResolver$getBlockData... **breaking the loop through streams.entrySet(), keeping StreamStates in memory forever leaking memory.**\r\nThat may happen when an application is terminated abruptly and executors removed before the connection is terminated or if shuffleIndexCache fails to get ShuffleIndexInformation\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ee050ddbc6eb6bc08c7751a0eb00e7a05b011b52/common/network-shuffle/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/shuffle/ExternalBlockHandler.java#L319\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ee050ddbc6eb6bc08c7751a0eb00e7a05b011b52/common/network-shuffle/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/shuffle/ExternalBlockHandler.java#L357\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ee050ddbc6eb6bc08c7751a0eb00e7a05b011b52/common/network-shuffle/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/shuffle/ExternalShuffleBlockResolver.java#L195\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ee050ddbc6eb6bc08c7751a0eb00e7a05b011b52/common/network-shuffle/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/shuffle/ExternalShuffleBlockResolver.java#L208\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ee050ddbc6eb6bc08c7751a0eb00e7a05b011b52/common/network-shuffle/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/shuffle/ExternalShuffleBlockResolver.java#L330\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAn app finished abnormal sometimes may cause shuffe service memory leak. In one of our production cases, the app failed for Stage cancelled as SparkContext has already shut down. the strange is there are still requests for fetch shuffle data and cause error in server side as below:\r\n```\r\n2019-12-08 22:23:33,375 ERROR server.TransportRequestHandler (TransportRequestHandler.java:processFetchRequest(132)) - Error opening block StreamChunkId{streamId=1902064894814, chunkIndex=0} for request from /10.221.115.175:38582\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Executor is not registered (appId=application_1574499669561_954327, execId=4514)\r\n```\r\nthe client sie also show corresponding log like this:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.FetchFailedException: Failure while fetching StreamChunkId{streamId=1902064894814, chunkIndex=0}: java.lang.RuntimeException: Executor is not registered (appId=application_1574499669561_954327, execId=4514)\r\n```\r\nin some cases, the request for `OpenBlocks` is still on the fly. In the code `ExternalShuffleBlockHandler#handleMessage`, it will register a `StreamState` to `OneForOneStreamManager#streams`, then reply an success response to client unconditionally , the client receive the response and then fire `ChunkFetchRequest` to fetch chunk, but at this time, the app has got event `APPLICATION_STOP` and executed `ExternalShuffleService#applicationRemoved` method to clean the app's `ExecutorShuffleInfo`, this made `Executor is not registered` error happended. even though when the client channel is closing, the `TransportRequestHandler#channelInactive` was called to clean the StreamState with relate channel, but when cleanning the `StreamState buffter`, it also lookup `ManagedBuffer` with` appId` and `execId` info which have been cleaned in executors object. we can also find the log:  `StreamManager connectionTerminated() callback failed` in NM's log file.\r\n\r\nso, when an `OpenBlocks` request come, we should lookup `ExternalShuffleBlockResolver#executors` , if the realted app is exited, we should not registering a `StreamState` and just close the client (or reply an special message to client and in client side to handle it). and when an app get `APPLICATION_STOP` to call `applicationRemoved`, we should clean the the related `streamState` before `ExecutorShuffleInfo` has been cleaned, this is what the PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR migrated to #27428\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656 only support use FILTER clause on aggregate expression without DISTINCT.\r\nThis PR will enhance this feature when one or more DISTINCT aggregate expressions which allows the use of the FILTER clause.\r\nSuch as:\r\n```\r\nselect sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect count(id) filter (where class_id = 1), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, count(id) filter (where class_id = 1), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect sum(distinct id), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, sum(distinct id), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect class_id, count(id), count(id) filter (where class_id = 1), sum(distinct id), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656, we use `AggregationIterator` to treat the filter conditions of aggregate expr. This is good because we can evaluate filter in first aggregate locally.\r\nIf we use `AggregationIterator` too, the filter conditions of DISTINCT aggregate expr will be treated in second or thrid aggregate.\r\nAccording to the discussion #26656 (comment). In order to reduce cost, we treat the filter conditions of DISTINCT aggregate expr in first aggregate or local is better.\r\nSo, this PR uses `Expand` to ensure the evaluation at local.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to throw `AnalysisException` when a removed SQL config is set to non-default value. The following SQL configs removed by #26559 are marked as removed:\r\n1. `spark.sql.fromJsonForceNullableSchema`\r\n2. `spark.sql.legacy.compareDateTimestampInTimestamp`\r\n3. `spark.sql.legacy.allowCreatingManagedTableUsingNonemptyLocation`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by notifying of removed SQL configs used by users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, before the `set` command was silently ignored:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.fromJsonForceNullableSchema=false;\r\nspark.sql.fromJsonForceNullableSchema\tfalse\r\n```\r\nafter the exception should be raised:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.fromJsonForceNullableSchema=false;\r\nError in query: The SQL config 'spark.sql.fromJsonForceNullableSchema' was removed in the version 3.0.0. It was removed to prevent errors like SPARK-23173 for non-default value.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests into `SQLConfSuite` for both cases when removed SQL configs

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded a new rule `NestColumnAliasing.Overaggregate` which will help pushdown nested columns wrapped inside `Aggregate`.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently,  the sizeInBytes of HiveTableRelation will be `defaultSizeInBytes`(Long.MaxValue) if `spark.sql.statistics.fallBackToHdfs` not enabled, and there are risks that Long type overflows when we set `spark.sql.sources.fileCompressionFactor` to a value greater than 1.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/cb9fc4bb6ffe542e526a6006582606eb709fb311/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/HadoopFsRelation.scala#L72\r\n\r\nThis PR will bring three major improvements:\r\n1.  Skip `DetermineTableStats` rule when hive table can be converted to datasource table, and compute the stats on demand in HadoopFsRelation. This size estimation can be more accurate for columnar-based files like parquet.\r\n2. It solves the overflows issue. \r\n3. It make the code path for sizeEstimation consistent. This will do the estimation on demand just like  what the `PruneFileSourcePartitions` may do.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR fix potential bugs and bring some other benefits.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT & test on real

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBackported from [pr#26994](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26994). Currently if function lookup fails, spark will give it a second chance by casting decimal type to double type. But for cases where decimal type doesn't exist, it's meaningless to lookup again and cause extra cost like unnecessary metastore access. We should throw exceptions directly in these cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCovered by existing

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is all the code for stage level scheduling feature - except for documentation.\r\n\r\nThis is meant to be for a reference when reviewing as I'm splitting this into mulitple prs with the intention its easier to review.  Note that only YARN currently supports this and it requires dynamic allocation to be enabled because currently we get new executors that match the profile exactly. We do not try to fit tasks into executors that were acquired for a different profile.\r\n\r\nAt a high level in order to support having different stages with different ResourceProfiles the changes required include:\r\n\r\n- Add a ResourceProfileManager that tracks the profiles and is used to map a Resource Profile Id to the actual Resource Profile. This allows us to pass around and store the id rather then the entire profile.\r\n- Introduce the concept of a default profile. This is essentially the profile you get today without stage level scheduling from the application level configs. \r\n- ImmutableResourceProfile - this is the actual resource profile used internally to Spark that is immutable. This is to allow the user to create and change a ResourceProfile in their code but as soon as they associated the profile with an RDD then spark internally uses the Immutable version so that it doesn't change.\r\n- YARN cluster manager updated to handle the profiles and request the correct containers from YARN.  I had to introduce using priorities here because YARN doesn't allow you to create containers with different resources within the same priority.  Now we have the priority = ResourceProfile Id and its easy to match the container we get from Yarn to what ResourceProfile we requested it for.\r\n- ExecutorAllocationManager, ExecutorMonitor, CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend - Updated to handle tracking the executors per ResourceProfile.\r\n- Scheduler - updated to handle the ResourceProfile associated with an RDD. It creates the Stage with the appropriate ResourceProfile. It has logic for handling conflicting ResourceProfiles when multiple RDD are put into the same stage that have different ResourceProfiles. The default behavior is to throw an exception, but there is a config that will allow the scheduler to merge the profiles using the max value of each resource.  The task scheduler was updated to make sure the resources of each executor meet the task resources for that profile and to assign them out properly.\r\n- I updated all the locations that used the hardcoded task cpus or other global configs to use the ResourceProfile based configs.\r\n- RDD api added and ResourceProfile, ExecutorResourceRequests, and TaskResourceRequests made public.\r\n\r\nEnd user api looks like this:\r\nval rpBuilder = new ResourceProfileBuilder()\r\nval ereq = new ExecutorResourceRequests()\r\nval treq = new TaskResourceRequests()\r\n\r\nereq.cores(2).memory(\"6g\").memoryOverhead(\"2g\").pysparkMemory(\"2g\").resource(\"gpu\", 2, \"/home/tgraves/getGpus\")\r\ntreq.cpus(2).resource(\"gpu\", 2)\r\nval resourceProfile = rpBuilder.require(ereq).require(treq).build\r\nval rdd = sc.parallelize(1 to 1000, 6).withResources(resourceProfile).map(x => (x, x))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow for different stages to use different executor/task resources\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes the RDD.withResources and ResourceProfile, ExecutorResourceRequest, TaskResourceRequest apis\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCheck before caching zippedData (as suggested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26483#issuecomment-569702482).\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a job finished, its running (re-submitted) map stages should be marked as finished if not used by other jobs. The running tasks of these stages are cancelled.\r\n\r\nAnd the ListenerBus should be notified too, otherwise, these map stage items will stay on the \"Active Stages\" page of web UI and never gone.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nSuppose job 0 has two stages: map stage 0 and result stage 1. Map stage 0 has two partitions, and its result stage 1 has two partitions too.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug:**\r\n1. map stage 0:    start task 0(```TID 0```) and task 1 (```TID 1```), then both finished successfully.\r\n2. result stage 1:  start task 0(```TID 2```) and task 1 (```TID 3```)\r\n3. result stage 1:  task 0(```TID 2```) finished successfully\r\n4. result stage 1:  speculative task 1.1(```TID 4```) launched, but then failed due to FetchFailedException.\r\n5. driver re-submits map stage 0 and result stage 1.\r\n6. map stage 0 (retry 1): task0(```TID 5```) launched\r\n7. result stage 1: task 1(```TID 3```) finished successfully, so job 0 finished.\r\n8. map stage 0 is removed from ```runningStages``` and ```stageIdToStage```, because it doesn't belong to any job.\r\n```\r\n  private def DAGScheduler#cleanupStateForJobAndIndependentStages(job: ActiveJob): HashSet[Stage] = {\r\n   ... \r\n      stageIdToStage.filterKeys(stageId => registeredStages.get.contains(stageId)).foreach {\r\n        case (stageId, stage) =>\r\n            ...\r\n            def removeStage(stageId: Int): Unit = {\r\n              for (stage <- stageIdToStage.get(stageId)) {\r\n                if (runningStages.contains(stage)) {\r\n                  logDebug(\"Removing running stage %d\".format(stageId))\r\n                  runningStages -= stage\r\n                }\r\n                ...\r\n              }\r\n              stageIdToStage -= stageId\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            jobSet -= job.jobId\r\n            if (jobSet.isEmpty) { // no other job needs this stage\r\n              removeStage(stageId)\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n  ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n9. map stage 0 (retry 1): task0(TID 5) finished successfully, but its stage 0 is not in ```stageIdToStage```, so the stage not ```markStageAsFinished```\r\n```\r\n  private[scheduler] def DAGScheduler#handleTaskCompletion(event: CompletionEvent): Unit = {\r\n    val task = event.task\r\n    val stageId = task.stageId\r\n    ...\r\n    if (!stageIdToStage.contains(task.stageId)) {\r\n      postTaskEnd(event)\r\n      // Skip all the actions if the stage has been cancelled.\r\n      return\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Relevant spark driver logs as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/01/02 11:21:45 INFO DAGScheduler: Got job 0 (main at

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26780\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26780, a new Avro data source option `actualSchema` is introduced for setting the original Avro schema in function `from_avro`, while the expected schema is supposed to be set in the parameter `jsonFormatSchema` of `from_avro`. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is another Avro data source option `avroSchema`. It is used for setting the expected schema in readiong and writing.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to use the option `avroSchema` option for  reading Avro data with an evolved schema and remove the new one `actualSchema`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnify and simplify the Avro data source options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nTo deserialize Avro data with an evolved schema, before changes:\r\n```\r\nfrom_avro('col, expectedSchema, (\"actualSchema\" -> actualSchema))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter changes:\r\n```\r\nfrom_avro('col, actualSchema, (\"avroSchema\" -> expectedSchema))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second parameter is always the actual Avro schema after changes.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdate the existing tests in
