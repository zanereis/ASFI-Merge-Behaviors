For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #20194 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nMotivation & Modifications:\r\n\r\nAfter creating the namespace, if the bookie affinity is set for the namespaces, before setting the namespace policies, then for setting bookie Affinity currently the code directly uses the default bundle of size 1 instead of reading the configuration to get the default bundle size while creating the namespaces. \r\n\r\nThe change fixes that and uses the user-provided value from the broker configurations to set the bundles.\r\n\r\n   \r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tests are already in place to create the bookie affinity group in `BrokerBookieIsolationTest.java` . So Just added a check to get the bundle size that was missing earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nEach `Dispatcher` has one bounded`FilterContext` object to run entryFilter logic.\r\n\r\ncurrent `analyzeBacklog` admin command will call the entry filter too.\r\n\r\nso when dispatcher and analyzeBacklog run the same time.\r\n\r\nthe misshared `FilterContext` may make the logic not right.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nwhen `analyzeBacklog` use another filterContext

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #20076\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\nAdd a counter `messageListenerQueueSize` for the message listener.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ]

That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #19698\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #19698\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `Consumer` and `Producer` interfaces both have `getStats` methods, allowing the user to access metrics directly. However, when a `deadLetterPolicy` or `retryPolicy` is used, `ConsumerImpl` creates additional producers that are [private to that class](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ConsumerImpl.java#L184-L186).\r\n\r\nThis implementation does not allow the user any access to the producer stats for those producers. I would like to propose a change that would allow public access to the `ProducerStats` objects for the retry letter & dead letter producers.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nNew methods on `ConsumerStats`, `getDeadLetterStats` and `getRetryLetterStats`. The stats objects are created when the deadLetter / retryLetter producers are initialized, otherwise they return null.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test coverage to verify the stats when using retry topics and dead letter topics, including with partitioned base topics.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#20236 \r\nPIP: #19409 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the `AuthenticationService`, we are currently using the deprecated `authenticate` methods. As a result, we hit the `Not Implemented` exception when using the `AuthenticationProviderOpenID`. This PR updates the implementation so that we're able \r\n\r\nThis solution isn't ideal for two reasons.\r\n\r\n1. We are not using the `authenticationHttpRequest` method, which seems like the right method for the WebSocket proxy. However, this is not a viable option, as I documented in #20237.\r\n2. We are calling `.get()` on a future. However, it is expected that the `AuthenticationProvider` not block forever, so I think this is acceptable for now. Please let me know if you disagree.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Replace `authenticate` with `authenticateAsync`.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed`\r\n\r\nNote that I do have documentation showing that 3.0.x does not support OIDC in the WebSocket Proxy. The `next` docs don't need that limitation since this PR fixes that and targets 3.1.0. https://github.com/apache/pulsar-site/pull/558\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16913\r\n## Motivation:\r\nThe transaction buffer segmented snapshot feature aims to improve the transaction buffer's performance by segmenting the snapshot and managing it more efficiently. However, for existing topics that were created before this feature was introduced, we need to ensure a seamless transition and compatibility when enabling the segmented snapshot feature.\r\n\r\n## Modifications:\r\n1. Updated the `recoverFromSnapshot()` method to read from another topic if the `persistentSnapshotIndexes` is null. This ensures that the appropriate snapshot data is fetched during the recovery process when upgrading to the segmented snapshot feature.\r\n2. Created a new test `testSnapshotProcessorUpdate()` that verifies the compatibility of the transaction\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#8703\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixed the unexpected consumer stuck issue of Key_Shared subscription by delayed messages.\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by the test provided in #8703.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\n- Suppose we have 10 messages 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 2 consumers, consumer-A and consumer-B\r\n- Only consumer-A connected to the topic and read 5 messages from the topic, 0,1,2,3,4, but haven’t acknowledged\r\n- Now, consumer-B joined, it will try to read messages from 5, but due to 0,1,2,3,4 are not being acknowledged, consumer-B can’t process new messages at this point because it might break the order(1 and 5 are from the same message key, we don’t know which one will be processed first in 2 instances)\r\n- So, the solution to guarantee the ordering dispatch is to pause the message dispatch for consumer-B until all the messages before message 5 are acked.\r\n\r\n#### The expected behavior\r\n\r\nif there are delayed messages in [0, 4] and [5,9]. All the messages from [5, 9] can be dispatched to consumer-B until all the messages from [0, 4] are acked. If there are messages with 1 hour delay in [0,4], consumer-B will be stuck for 1 hour. But maybe there are messages only with 10 sec delay in [5, 9].

The receive timeout is 30 seconds, and the messages are with 10 seconds. So the delayed messages for the first consumer should be delivered.\r\n\r\n#### The root cause\r\n\r\nThe broker first replays messages from the replay queue without looking at the delayed tracker. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/c4aec6661e795c46181dc1fa79282065fa875768/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L1072-L1084\r\n\r\nSo, if all the messages in the relay queue are for the second consumer, the dispatch will run into an infinite loop(it also should be fixed, but not in this PR) because the messages are not allowed to be delivered at that time due to the first consumer hadn't acked the messages before the second consumer joined.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nChange the getMessagesToReplayNow method to dispatch messages based on the message ID (FIFO). So that the first consumer can receive the delayed messages, and then the second consumer can start to consume messages after the first consumer acked the delayed messages.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test is added\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the scenarios<sup>[1]</sup> below, the replicator only acknowledges messages and does not replicate them, but if the topic is closing now, the operation acknowledge(in other words: `cursor.asyncDelete`) will be failed by the error `Cursor was already closed`, then it will retry again(see the code <sup>[2]</sup>) and fail again....loop.\r\n\r\n<strong>[1]</strong>: scenarios of skip messages:\r\n- the message can not be deserialized.\r\n- the entry is a transaction marker.\r\n- the message has been aborted by the transaction.\r\n- the message is repeated from another cluster.\r\n- the message is expired(see the retention policy).\r\n- the message specifies the target cluster, but the replicator is not the owner of the target cluster.\r\n\r\n<strong>[2]</strong>: Code of retry to acknowledge messages.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentReplicator.java#L545\r\n\r\nNote: I tried to write a test, but it took me more than an hour but failed, so there was no test of this change.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nJust like the existing solution of `read entry fail`(see the code <sup>[3]</sup>): if ack failed by `CursorAlreadyClosedException`, just close the replicator(will not retry). \r\n\r\n<strong>[3]</strong>: Code of the existing solution of `read entry fail`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentReplicator.java#L434\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT

Motivation\r\n\r\nIf you create a topic with the double quote in the name (e.g. `public/default/\"mytopic`) then there are some metrics that are generated in a broken format. \r\n\r\n```\r\npulsar_subscriptions_count{cluster=\"mycluster\",namespace=\"namespace1\",topic=\"persistent://public/default/\"mytopic\"} 0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leads to errors in the grafana dashboards. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Escape all label values when generating the metrics\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT

Motivation\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\nAfter the PR https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20187, the custom action at `.github/actions/gradle-enterprise/action.yml` simply sets the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable. Since this is the only step performed by this action, it makes sense to remove it to simplify workflows.\r\n\r\nThis was mentioned in the review for https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20187: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20187#pullrequestreview-1406899559\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Remove the custom `gradle-enterprise` action\r\n- Use the built in `env` configuration to set the `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` where needed\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes. -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` <!-- Your PR changes impact docs and you will update later -->\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed` <!-- Your PR changes do not impact docs -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-complete` <!-- Docs have been already added -->\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked repository: <!-- ENTER URL HERE -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAfter opening this PR, the build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-03T11:46:29Z","updated_at":"2023-05-29T06:21:24Z","closed_at":"2023-05-04T11:06:14Z","merged_at":"2023-05-04T11:06:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"010bd508cecae501fa812be6df4b3f7d33ec4be6","assignee":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3125409143,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI1NDA5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-not-needed","name":"doc-not-needed","color":"e0e0e0","default":false,"description":"Your

Motivation\r\n\r\n- Maven http connection pooling was originally disabled with #8921 to prevent download issues (TCP connection reset) on GitHub Actions VMs.\r\n- Maven is switching to \"Maven Resolver\" (\"aether\") in newer versions instead of using Wagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n  - Disable Maven http connection pooling also for aether\r\n  - Set request timeout to 60000ms

Motivation\r\n\r\n- Task `loadOrCreatePersistentTopic`<sup>[1]</sup>: it calls `getBundles(load policies from ZK)` after `LockManagerImpl.lambda$acquireLock`. This all runs on the thread `main-EventThread.` It stuck at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/naming/NamespaceBundleFactory.java#L233\r\n  - <strong>(Highlight)</strong> This task occupied the event thread of the ZK client so that other ZK tasks could not be finished anymore(Including the task itself), and it calls `bundlesCache.synchronous().get(nsname)` which is a blocking method.\r\n- Task `splitBundle`<sup>[2]</sup>: remove old bundles and create news. It stuck at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/ModularLoadManagerImpl.java#L1143 caused by `main-EventThread` is busy.\r\n- Task `lookup`<sup>[3]</sup>: refresh policies and get metadata. It stuck at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/ModularLoadManagerImpl.java#L383 caused by `bundlesCache ` is loading.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- This issue is found in a scenario where KOP is used.\r\n- It is usually expressed as many lookup timeout logs are printed, and Pub and Sub are stuck.\r\n- If there are a few topics, the heartbeat responses nothing caused by the event thread of the ZK client is not working correctly. Eventually, the ZK client will be reconnected, and the problem will be alleviated.\r\n- If there are a lot of topics, there will be many lookup requests, and the deadlock will be triggered again,

Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR publishes a build scan for every CI build on GitHub Actions and for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails.\r\n\r\nThe build scans of the Apache Pulsar project are published to the Gradle Enterprise instance at [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache Pulsar project and all other Apache projects.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Apache Pulsar build is configured to publish build scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/) for CI only. This pull request enhances that functionality by also publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/) for authenticated Apache committers. On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache Pulsar will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\n- Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\n- Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\n- Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Update the Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension to 1.17\r\n- Remove the logic that copies `ge-extensions.xml` in favor of the more conventional `extensions.xml` file. Updates to the `publishIfAuthenticated` property in Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension 1.17 will cause the build to print no output if the user is not authenticated to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/).\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a

Key_Shared subscription has out-of-order cases because of the race condition of [the recently joined consumers feature](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L400-L408).\r\n   Consider the following flow.\r\n\r\n   1. Assume that the current read position is `1:6` and the recently joined consumers is empty.\r\n   2. Called [OpReadEntry#internalReadEntriesComplete](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/OpReadEntry.java#L92-L95) from thread-1.\r\n      Then, the current read position is updated to `1:11` (Messages from `1:6` to `1:10` have yet to be dispatched to consumers).\r\n   3. Called [PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers#addConsumer](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L130-L131) from thread-2.\r\n      Then, the new consumer is stored to recently joined consumers with read position `1:11`.\r\n   4. Called [PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers#trySendMessagesToConsumers](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L174) from thread-5.\r\n      Then, messages from `1:6` to `1:10` are dispatched to consumers. From the recently joined consumers feature, the new consumer can receive messages from `1:6` to `1:10`. **However, it is not expected.**\r\n      For example, if existing consumers have some unacked messages and disconnect, it causes out of order in some cases.\r\n\r\n2. Key_Shared subscription has a redundant process.\r\n   [The stuckConsumers feature](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L369-L375) was introduced from https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7553 .\r\n   However, it can't fix the issue entirely because it doesn't consider the range changes.\r\n   After this commit, https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/10762 was introduced. It fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Store last sent position instead of read position to recently joined consumers.\r\n   Updating read position, then dispatching messages, and adding new consumer are not exclusive.\r\n   I used the last send position to get a position without any new exclusion features.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the last sent position per key.\r\n   When I introduced the last sent position, I noticed a new concern. Consider the following flow.\r\n\r\n   1. Assume that the [entries](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L174) has the following messages,\r\n      - `msg-1`, key: `key-a`, position: `1:1`\r\n      - `msg-2`, key: `key-a`, position: `1:2`\r\n      - `msg-3`, key: `key-a`, position: `1:3`\r\n      - `msg-4`, key: `key-b`, position: `1:4`\r\n      - `msg-5`, key: `key-b`, position: `1:5`\r\n      - `msg-6`, key: `key-b`, position: `1:6`\r\n      the dispatcher has two consumers (`c1` `messagesForC` is 1, `c2` `messageForC` is 1000), and the selector will return `c1` if `key-a` and `c2` if `key-b`.\r\n   2. Send `msg-1` to `c1` and `msg-4` - `msg-6` to `c2`.\r\n      - So, the current last sent position is `1:6`.\r\n      - `c1` never acknowledge `msg-1`.\r\n   3. Add new consumer `c3`, and the selector will return `c3` if `key-a`.\r\n   4. Send `msg-2` - `msg-3` to `c3` because `1:2` and `1:3` are less than the last sent position, `1:6`.\r\n   5. Disconnect `c1`.\r\n   6. Send `msg-1` to `c3`.\r\n      Now, `c3` receives messages without expected order about `key-a`.\r\n\r\n   To avoid this issue, I introduce the last sent positions feature.\r\n\r\n3. Remove redundant features due to the addition of the last sent positions feature.\r\n\r\n   1. Remove this condition because the last sent positions feature restricts part of messages.\r\n      New consumers can receive any new messages with the message key that is not in the last sent position.\r\n      https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L323-L336\r\n\r\n   2. Remove this behavior because the last sent positions has positions per key.\r\n      If some key is stuck at a certain point in time, from that point, new consumers store the same information about the key to the `recentlyJoinedConsumers`.\r\n      https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L365-L399\r\n\r\n   3. Remove this behavior because this calculation is moved to LastSentPositions#compareToLastSentPosition.\r\n      https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/35e9897742b7db4bd29349940075a819b2ad6999/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L400-L408\r\n\r\n4. Remove the stuckConsumers feature.\r\n5. Reconstruct some consumer stats fields related to Key_Shared.\r\n   **This is a breaking change.** However, if this PR is merged, the existing field which is removed in this PR is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added unit test to ensure the behavior of last sent positions feature works properly\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/issues/623\r\n\r\nMessageRedeliveryController uses the RoaringBitmap under the covers to track entryIds to redeliver.\r\nThe bug in RoaringBitmap (that has now been fixed) caused at least the case that the bit index 65535 couldn't be set.\r\nThe consequence of this would be that a message that should be redelivered doesn't get delivered and this could get Key_Shared subscriptions to get stuck. This could impact also other subscription types and cause a backlog to build up.\r\nThis bug was introduced in 2.10.2 with https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17804 since that's when MessageRedeliveryController switched to use the RoaringBitmap based datastructure.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Upgrade `RoaringBitmap` version to 0.9.44, this issue be fixed by PR (https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap/pull/624)\r\n* Add test for `RoaringBitmap.contains`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nIn mode `Key_Shared,` Pulsar will deliver messages with different keys to different consumers. The message list with the same key is often not continuous, and Pulsar will not stop delivering messages to the client if some consumers cannot continue to acknowledge messages<sup>[1]</sup>, Pulsar just put the messages that were meant for the stuck consumer into the replay queue<sup>[2]</sup>, which makes the replay queue costs more and more messages until memory ran out.\r\n\r\n<strong>[1]<strong>: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L450\r\n<strong>[2]<strong>: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L273-L282\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a limitation of max memory usage of the replay queue( Only do this if a consumer is not working properly ). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19414 introduces a breaking change for the deprecated `TopicMessageIdImpl#getInnerMessageId` method.

#16763 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nOptimization protobuf code in the bucket delayed tracker\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Split `DelayedMessageIndexBucketSnapshotFormat.proto` to `DelayedMessageIndexBucketMetadata.proto` and `DelayedMessageIndexBucketSegment.proto`.\r\n* Use `lightproto-maven-plugin` to generate `DelayedMessageIndexBucketSegment.proto` code (Due to `lightproto-maven-plugin` don't support `map` type so keep using `protobuf-maven-plugin` to generate DelayedMessageIndexBucketMetadata.proto code)\r\n* Reduce data copy in the deserialize\r\n* Add `popToObject`  and `peekTimestamp` method in the DelayedIndexQueue to reduce object create\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please

#20066\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen a role wants to use the resource, the role needs to have resource permissions. If a role is a super user or tenant admin we should allow this request immediately, otherwise go to call the `AuthorizationProvider` to check the permission.\r\n\r\nWe currently have superuser/tenant administrator checks in `PulsarAuthorizationProvider` and `AuthorizationService`, there is confusion so the #20066 issue is introduced. So I suggest unifying superuser/tenantAdmin checks in the `AuthorizationService`, and then the `AuthorizationProvider` only needs to consider their business permissions.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Move superuser/tenantAdmin checks to `AuthorizationService` from `PulsarAuthorizationProvider`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#19849 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe new `KubernetesServiceAccountTokenAuthProvider` introduced by #19888  does not configure the authentication for download because there is an unnecessary check that the `getFunctionAuthenticationSpec` is not `null`. Given that we do not use this spec in creating the auth, it is unnecessary to use here. Further, when we construct the function's authentication, we do not have this null check.

Modifications\r\n\r\n* Update the `KubernetesRuntime` to add authentication params to the download command when provided.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA new test is added.\r\n\r\n###

I think this approach could have unintended consequences. Instead, I think we should change the `Consumer` and the `Producer` logic to call the correct `AuthorizationService` method. I propose an update to the `Consumer` and `Producer` logic here #20142.\r\n\r\nGiven that our goal is to deprecate the `AuthorizationService` methods for `canProduce` and `canConsume`, I think we should not change their implementations.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Revert https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20068\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is trivial.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20066\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20068 we changed the way that the `AuthorizationService` is implemented. I think we should change the `Consumer` and the `Producer` logic to call the correct `AuthorizationService` method.\r\n\r\nGiven that our goal is to deprecate the `AuthorizationService` methods for `canProduce` and `canConsume`, this change helps us move in the right direction.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Update `Producer` and `Consumer` in broker to call the

Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19414 does not follow the design of https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/18950\r\n\r\n> Since the aimed developers are Pulsar core developers, it's added in\r\n> the pulsar-common module (PulsarApi.proto is also in this module), not\r\n> the pulsar-client-api module.\r\n\r\nThe reason to made such changes in the previous PR was that `TopicMessageId#create` now cannot be a `MessageIdAdv` if `MessageIdAdv` is not in the `pulsar-client-api` module. However, it can be avoided.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Move the `MessageIdAdv` class to the `pulsar-common` module.\r\n- Implement the `MessageIdAdv` interface in `TopicMessageIdImpl` instead of `TopicMessageId.Impl`.\r\n- Create a `TopicMessageIdImpl` instance for `TopicMessageId#create` via the `DefaultImplementation` class with the overhead of reflection.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `AuthenticationProviderOpenID` error logs from the Kubernetes client are not very helpful in certain cases because we only get the error's message and not the error's response body. See https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/2066 for details on the solution.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a problematic error:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.AuthenticationProviderList - Authentication failed for auth provider class org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.oidc.AuthenticationProviderOpenID:\r\njavax.naming.AuthenticationException: Error retrieving OpenID Provider Metadata from Kubernetes API server:\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.oidc.OpenIDProviderMetadataCache$1.onFailure(OpenIDProviderMetadataCache.java:174) ~[org.apache.pulsar-pulsar-broker-auth-oidc-3.0.0.jar:3.0.0]\r\n\tat io.kubernetes.client.openapi.ApiClient$1.onResponse(ApiClient.java:927) ~[io.kubernetes-client-java-api-17.0.2.jar:?]\r\n\tat okhttp3.internal.connection.RealCall$AsyncCall.run(RealCall.kt:519) ~[com.squareup.okhttp3-okhttp-4.9.3.jar:?]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1136) ~[?:?]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:635) ~[?:?]\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:833) ~[?:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I enable debug logging out of the API Client, I can see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO: {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"forbidden: User \\\"system:serviceaccount:michael-test:superuser\\\" cannot get path \\\"/.well-known/openid-configuration/\\\"\",\"reason\":\"Forbidden\",\"details\":{},\"code\":403}\r\n\r\nApr 19, 2023 2:50:25 AM okhttp3.internal.platform.Platform log\r\nINFO: <-- END HTTP (246-byte body)\r\n2023-04-19T02:50:25,832+0000 [pulsar-web-40-1] DEBUG \r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: the solution to this problem is to update the `system:service-account-issuer-discovery` `ClusterRole` to include endpoints with trailing slashes. I created https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/117455 to help solve the permission problem in kubernetes.)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Use both the message and the response body when converting a Kubernetes client error into a Pulsar Authentication error.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed`\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked repository: no need for a forked

#12105 and #19771 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWith the implementation of asynchronous authentication in PIP 97, I missed a case in the `AuthenticationProviderList` where we need to implement the `authenticateAsync` methods. This PR is necessary for making the `AuthenticationProviderToken` and the `AuthenticationProviderOpenID` work together, which is necessary for anyone transitioning to `AuthenticationProviderOpenID`.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Implement `AuthenticationListState#authenticateAsync` using a recursive algorithm that first attempts to authenticate the client using the current `authState` and then tries the remaining options.\r\n* Implement `AuthenticationProviderList#authenticateAsync` using a recursive algorithm that attempts each provider sequentially.\r\n* Add test to `AuthenticationProviderListTest` that exercises this method. It didn't technically fail previously, but it's worth adding.\r\n* Add test to `AuthenticationProviderOpenIDIntegrationTest` to cover the exact failures that were causing problems.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA new test is added and all existing tests pass.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed`\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked

Motivation\r\n\r\n#### Background of Admin API `PersistentTopics.getSubscriptions`\r\nIt works like this:\r\n1. getSubscriptions( `tp1` )\r\n2. is partitioned topic? \r\n  `no`: return subscriptions\r\n  `yes`: getSubscriptions(`tp1-partition-0`)....getSubscriptions(`tp1-partition-n`)\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n#### Background of the issue of `TopicName.getPartition(int index)`\r\n```java\r\nString partitionedTopic = \"tp1-partition-0-DLQ\";\r\n\r\nTopicName partition0 = partitionedTopic.getPartition(0);// Highlight: the partition0.toString() will be \"tp1-partition-0-DLQ\"(it is wrong).The correct value is \"tp1-partition-0-DLQ-partition-0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/da788794ebe211bc96d4d961de49ffeeb473ffad/pulsar-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/naming/TopicName.java#L233-L237\r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\nTherefore, if there has a partitioned topic named `tp1-partition-0-DLQ`, the method `PersistentTopics.getSubscriptions` will works like this:\r\n1. call Admin API ``PersistentTopics.getSubscriptions(\"tp1-partition-0-DLQ\")`\r\n2. is partitioned topic? \r\n3. yes, call `TopicName.getPartition(0)` to get partition 0 and will get `tp1-partition-0-DLQ` , then loop to step-1.\r\n\r\nThen the infinite HTTP call `PersistentTopics.getSubscriptions` makes the broker crash.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n#### Quick fix(this PR does it)\r\nIf hits the issue which makes the topic name wrong, do not loop to step 1.\r\n\r\n#### Long-term fix\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19841 fixes the issue which makes the topic name wrong, and this PR will create unfriendly compatibility, and PIP 263 https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20033 will make compatibility good.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

local environment sometimes.\r\n\r\nwhy deadlock happen ?\r\n\r\ninitializeState will call `admin.namespaces().unload(\"public/default\");`\r\n\r\n\r\nso in the broker side one call stack is \r\n- org.apache.pulsar.broker.admin.v2.Namespaces.internalUnloadNamespaceBundleAsync\r\n  |_ org.apache.pulsar.broker.namespace.NamespaceService.isNamespaceBundleOwned\r\n     |_ org.apache.pulsar.metadata.api.MetadataStore.exists\r\n        |_ AbstractMetadataStore#existsCache -> asyncLoad\r\n            |_ AbstractMetadataStore.existsFromStore\r\n                |_ ZKMetadataStore.existsFromStore     line:351   // we are on the `configuration-metadata-store` internal executor thread now.\r\n\r\nso we triggered the CompletableFuture here and the following thing is always execute on this thread. ( the stack above is the following thing )\r\n\r\nthen the code will call on metadata store `IsolationPolicyResources.getIsolationDataPolicies` \r\nso only one thread is here to trigger BatchMetadataStore to flush metadata call. but it won't be executed.\r\nan deadlock occurs.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nforce cache loading callback complete on forkjoinPool to avoid other task execute on metadataStore thread by CompletableFuture.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\nthe unit test should not fail on `ExtensibleLoadManagerImplTest.initializeState`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background of Deduplication:** Every message will have an attribute `sequence-id`, and Broker will mark the last `sequence-id` for each producer. If a producer sends a message with a smaller `sequence-id`, it will be rejected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Background of Geo-Replication:** The replicator works like this:  read messages from the source cluster; send messages to the target cluster; if there has something error, Replicator will rewind these messages; loop to the next reading.\r\n\r\n**Background of ManagedCursor:** ManagedCursor marks the next position which will read from BK, and we call it `readPosition`, and update after a read is complete. For example: \r\n1. initialize `readPosition` with `0.`\r\n2. read 10 messages\r\n3. update `readPosition` to `10.`\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n<strong>(Highlight)</strong>Therefore, if messages are sent out of order, many messages will be discarded. for example: if send `1,2,3,5,4`, then the message `4` will be discarded by duplication check.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**There have three scenarios that make messages out of order**\r\n#### scenario-1\r\n\r\n| time | `thread rewind` | `thread reading messages`|\r\n| -- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | receive messages `[3:0 ~ 4:0]` |  |\r\n| 1 |  | async read start(`readPosition=4:0, markDeleted=3:0`) |\r\n| 2 | rewind `readPosition` (` --> 3:0`)` | |\r\n| 3 |  | read complete, set `readPosition`(` --> 5:0`) |\r\n| 4 | receive messages `[4:0 ~ 5.0]` |  |\r\n| 5 | the messages `3:0 ~ 4:0` will nolanger be received until next `rewind` |\r\n\r\n#### scenario-2\r\n\r\n| time | `receive messages` | `async load schema` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | receive messages `1~3` | \r\n| 2 | async load schema if needed<sup>[1]</sup> |\r\n| 3 | receive messages `4~5`|\r\n| 4 | send messages `4~5` to remote cluster | \r\n| 5 | | load schema success, rewind cursor to position `1`  |\r\n| 6 | <strong>(Highlight)</strong>Receive messages `1~3` and will send fail by duplication check |\r\n\r\n<strong>[1]</strong>: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/GeoPersistentReplicator.java#L160-L179\r\n\r\n#### scenario-3\r\n- receive messages `1~3` \r\n- process these messages to send to the remote cluster, but an exception occurs<sup>[2]</sup>.\r\n- receive messages `4~5`\r\n- send messages `4~5` to the remote cluster\r\n- the messages `1~3` are lost\r\n\r\n<strong>[2]</strong>: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/GeoPersistentReplicator.java#L190-L192\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nMake the replicator processes messages only sequentially.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Why not just fix the issues which make messages out of order\r\n- For scenario-1, we will start a PIP to fix it.\r\n- For scenario-2, to ensure performance, read and write tasks are not synchronized, which makes in-flight read requests difficult to control\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16913\r\n### Motivation\r\nEnhance monitoring capabilities for the transaction buffer snapshot segments by introducing new metrics. These metrics help users better understand the performance and behavior of the transaction buffer, enabling them to make informed decisions for tuning and troubleshooting purposes.\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\nIntroduce new metrics related to transaction buffer snapshot segments, including counters for add, delete, and read operations, as well as gauges and histograms for snapshot indexes and index entry sizes. Additionally, update the `AbortTxnProcessor` to incorporate these new metrics and properly expose them through the Pulsar monitoring system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Meanwhile, the lock of ZkSessionWatch is intending to  project the currentStatus field,  no need  to perform a lock operation when executing checkConnectionStatus method.  \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. don't perform a lock operation in ZKSessionWatcher.checkConnectionStatus method, which runs in single thread.\r\n2. perform a lock operation in ZKSessionWatcher.checkStatus method.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nMost of the java connectors (sinks and sources) map the configuration to a java class. Pulsar exposes a method to convert the configuration (`IOConfigUtils#loadWithSecrets`) using a jackson mapper. However is up to the connector to decide how to convert the configuration.\r\nMost of the builtin java connectors do not allow unknown fields in their configuration. This is usually a good thing since it alerts the user that something is malconfigured. But this doesn't leave space for connectors' rollbacks.\r\n\r\nThe scenario which is not possible to cover is:\r\n- Upgrade a builtin connector which has a new config property\r\n- Upgrade existing connectors and use this new property\r\n- For some reasons, the connectors must be rollbacked. In order to let the connector work, it's required to rollback also the existing connectors' configuration removing the new field. This can be very hard to achieve in large clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n- Added a new flag in the functions worker `ignoreUnknownConfigFields` (default false) that strips out fields not supported in the current sink/source config. The sink/source config class is retrieved from the service definition (`sinkConfigClass` and `sourceConfigClass`)\r\n- In case a field is stripped out, a WARN log is printed out: \r\n```\r\n11:31:37,446 WARN [public/default/elastic-sink-0] [instance: 0] JavaInstanceRunnable - Field 'bro' not defined in the SINK configuration org.apache.pulsar.io.elasticsearch.ElasticSearchConfig, the field will be ignored\r\n```\r\n- Added the configClass reference in the service definitions of connectors that were missing it\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [z] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we execute the logic of Broker Close, we first shut down the Broker Service, and then close the LoadManagerTask. This will cause the Broker to be assigned to a new bundle during the shutdown of the Broker, resulting in an inelegant shutdown of the Broker. , eventually triggering brokerShutdownTimeoutMs to forcibly shut down the Broker, causing the Client to fail to produce or consume messages over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20965307/232401254-dbed0559-f3a6-4c07-a92f-a48515a2e6a7.png)\r\n\r\nWhen shutting down the Broker, we will first remove the temporary node of the current Broker from zookeeper, which is the logic we expect. We expect that the broker will not allocate new bundles during active shutdown of the broker. However, since the task of loadManagerExecutor has been regularly executed to report its own Load information to zookeeper, this will cause the Broker node to be shut down to be re-registered by loadManagerExecutor. At this time, the Leader Broker believes that the Broker node to be shut down can also allocate a new bundle, and will redistribute the new bundle information.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, in the code logic of Pulsar Service shutdown, the comments clearly indicate that we expect LoadMangerTask to be closed before Broker Service, but in real code implementation, it is the opposite.\r\n```\r\n // cancel loadShedding task and shutdown the loadManager executor before shutting down the broker\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdjust the order of component shutdown when Broker is shut down so that LoadManagerTask is shut down before Broker Service\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` <!-- Your PR changes impact docs and you will update later -->\r\n-

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16691\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nRaising a PR to implement: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/16691\r\n\r\nAfter the compaction, the cursor can fast-forward to the compacted horizon when a large number of messages are compacted before the next read. Hence, ServiceUnitStateCompactionStrategy also needs to cover this case. Currently, the existing and slow(their states are far behind) tableviews with ServiceUnitStateCompactionStrategy could not accept those compacted messages. In the load balance extension context, this means the ownership data could be inconsistent among brokers.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nThis PR \r\n  - fixes ServiceUnitStateCompactionStrategy to accept the state data if its version is bigger than the current version +1.\r\n  - (minor fix) does not repeatedly update the replication_clusters in the policies when creating the system namespace. This update redundantly triggers ZK watchers when restarting brokers.\r\n  -  sets closeWithoutWaitingClientDisconnect=true, upon unload(following the same setting as the modular LM's)\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Updated unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.
