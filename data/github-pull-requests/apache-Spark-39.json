for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduced a new configuration `spark.sql.hive.convertInsertingUnpartitionedTable` alongside the existing `spark.sql.hive.convertInsertingPartitionedTable` to allow fine grain switching from Hive Serde to Data Source on inserting Parquet/ORC Hive tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the practice of hybrid workload (Hive tables may be read/written by Hive, Spark, Impala, etc.), we usually use DataSource for reading Parquet/ORC tables but Hive Serde for writing, the current configuration combination allows us to achieve that except for unpartitioned tables.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. The new added configuration `spark.sql.hive.convertInsertingUnpartitionedTable` default value is `true`, which keeps the existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT is added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdded support for the Variant type in the `from_json` expression. SQL statements like `select from_json('{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 0.8}', 'variant')` should convert the input json string to the variant type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEarlier, `from_json` only supported fixed schemas in the schema field. Adding the variant data type should allow support for semi-structured data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users can now specify `'variant'` as the schema in `from_json`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests. `from_json/to_json` round trip tests are identical to `parse_json/to_json` tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-04-15T02:04:44Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T01:37:04Z","closed_at":"2024-04-18T01:37:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3971365b7679e15517f12dacd3715d3dd25a6bf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6ba982bb74a19c520091141ce2b8c18dadd9f88","head":{"label":"harshmotw-db:from_json_variant","ref":"from_json_variant","sha":"b6ba982bb74a19c520091141ce2b8c18dadd9f88","user":{"login":"harshmotw-db","id":137231545,"node_id":"U_kgDOCC38uQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137231545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db","html_url":"https://github.com/harshmotw-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":667542123,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ8niaw","name":"spark","full_name":"harshmotw-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"harshmotw-db","id":137231545,"node_id":"U_kgDOCC38uQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137231545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db","html_url":"https://github.com/harshmotw-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/harshmotw-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-47845\r\n\r\nSupport column type in `split` function for scala and python. SQL already supports this, but scala / python functions currently don't.\r\n\r\nA hypothetical example to illustrate:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.{col, split}\r\n\r\nval example = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    Seq(\r\n      (\"Doe, John\", \", \", 2),\r\n      (\"Smith,Jane\", \",\", 2),\r\n      (\"Johnson\", \",\", 1)\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n  .toDF(\"name\", \"delim\", \"expected_parts_count\")\r\n\r\nexample.createOrReplaceTempView(\"test_data\")\r\n\r\n// works for SQL\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT split(name, delim, expected_parts_count) AS name_parts FROM test_data\").show()\r\n\r\n// currently doesn't compile for scala, but will be supported after this PR\r\nexample.withColumn(\"name_parts\", split(col(\"name\"), col(\"delim\"), col(\"expected_parts_count\"))).show() \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI have a use case to split a String typed column with different delimiters defined in other columns of the Dataframe.\r\n\r\nBut also following this guidance:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/85c4f053f25a7f20546600e179a7303a4409834f/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala#L59-L61\r\n\r\nWe might want to do this to a bunch of other functions as well. But I will start with this one and maybe do more if I get time / people generally think it's useful to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, new feature (via function overloading in scala, and more type handling in python).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests with column input type to scala functions. \r\nAdded doctest for pyspark and pyspark connect.\r\nAdded explain and plan proto generated for jvm connect test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Others\r\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.","created_at":"2024-04-15T01:04:33Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T01:43:04Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T01:42:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8eb1fc28373b5248c9af0a5b723f420835ac66a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46045/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46045/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46045/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46355bbf6be615d2a68a6f0df489a267d21c5acd","head":{"label":"CTCC1:SPARK-47845-support-column-type-in-split-function","ref":"SPARK-47845-support-column-type-in-split-function","sha":"46355bbf6be615d2a68a6f0df489a267d21c5acd","user":{"login":"CTCC1","id":23428099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDI4MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23428099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1","html_url":"https://github.com/CTCC1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":671352210,"node_id":"R_kgDOKAQFkg","name":"spark","full_name":"CTCC1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CTCC1","id":23428099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDI4MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23428099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1","html_url":"https://github.com/CTCC1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTCC1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CTCC1/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

Add tests to validate behavior. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe are incrementally adding collation support to built-in string functions in Spark. These functions are intended to be supported for collated types. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nthese sql functions will now not throw errors when passed in collated types. Instead, they will return the right value, of the passed in type. Or of the default collation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit testing + ad-hoc spark shell and pyspark shell interactions. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling? \r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-13T09:38:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T07:18:08Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T07:18:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fedab547eca77829997dbecb822fef8fd3365966","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0357b76c182f91103f06d1e13e637fea53ac9c0","head":{"label":"GideonPotok:spark_collation_47413_5","ref":"spark_collation_47413_5","sha":"b0357b76c182f91103f06d1e13e637fea53ac9c0","user":{"login":"GideonPotok","id":31429832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDI5ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31429832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok","html_url":"https://github.com/GideonPotok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":767539947,"node_id":"R_kgDOLb-66w","name":"spark","full_name":"GideonPotok/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GideonPotok","id":31429832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDI5ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31429832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok","html_url":"https://github.com/GideonPotok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GideonPotok/spark","description":"Apache

Add tests to validate behavior. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe are incrementally adding collation support to built-in string functions in Spark. These functions are intended to be supported for collated types. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nthese sql functions will now not throw errors when passed in collated types. Instead, they will return the right value, of the passed in type. Or of the default collation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit testing + ad-hoc spark shell and pyspark shell interactions. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling? \r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-13T07:41:42Z","updated_at":"2024-04-15T10:10:04Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T10:10:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b86cd4e2c395b304a67b6dda02299f5a6c69970","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea6d192e39a3e0d581b4d1e427633fd50f8f64ec","head":{"label":"GideonPotok:spark_collation_47413_4","ref":"spark_collation_47413_4","sha":"ea6d192e39a3e0d581b4d1e427633fd50f8f64ec","user":{"login":"GideonPotok","id":31429832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDI5ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31429832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok","html_url":"https://github.com/GideonPotok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":767539947,"node_id":"R_kgDOLb-66w","name":"spark","full_name":"GideonPotok/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GideonPotok","id":31429832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDI5ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31429832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok","html_url":"https://github.com/GideonPotok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GideonPotok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GideonPotok/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nServer and client side for the client side listener. \r\n\r\nThe client should start send a `add_listener_bus_listener` RPC for the first listener ever added.\r\nThe server should start a long running thread and register a new \"SparkConnectListenerBusListener\" upon receiving the RPC, the listener should stream back the listener events to the client using the `responseObserver` created in the `executeHandler` of the `add_listener_bus_listener` call. \r\n\r\nOn the client side, a spark client method: `execute_long_running_command` is created to continuously receive new events from the server with a long-running iterator. The client starts a new thread for handing such events. Please see the graphs below for a more detailed illustration.\r\n\r\nWhen either the last client side listener is removed, and the client sends \"remove_listener_bus_listener\" call, or the `send` method of `SparkConnectListenerBusListener` throws, the long-running server thread is stopped, as an effect, the final `ResultComplete` is sent to the client, closing the client's long-running iterator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDevelopment of spark connect streaming\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test. Removed old unit test that created for verifying server-side listener limitations.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to testing PySpark Connect server to have `pyspark.core` package by running Python workers once (and they will be reused later).\r\n\r\nAlso, it fixes accumulator processing available in Python workers, that are used for Python profilers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make sure on test coverage with `pyspark-connect` package for `UDFProfilerParityTests` and `MemoryProfilerParityTests`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/actions/runs/8682010811/job/23805712575\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

This optimization is correct for batch queries. However Streaming queries also read information from StateStore, and the output contains both the results from StateStore (computed in previous microbatches) and data from input sources (computed in this microbatch). The HashAggregate node after StateStore always reads grouping key value as the optimized literal (as the grouping key expression is optimized into a literal by the optimizer). This ends up replacing keys in StateStore with the literal value resulting in incorrect output. \r\n\r\nSee an example logical and physical plan below for a query performing a union on 2 data streams, followed by a groupBy. Note that the name#4 expression has been optimized to ds1. The Streaming query Aggregate adds StateStoreSave node as child of HashAggregate, however any grouping key read from StateStore will still be read as ds1 due to the optimization. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Optimized Logical Plan\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.FoldablePropagation ===\r\n\r\n=== Old Plan ===\r\n\r\nWriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, eb67645e-30fc-41a8-8006-35bb7649c202, Complete, 0\r\n+- Aggregate [name#4], [name#4, count(1) AS count#31L]\r\n   +- Project [ds1 AS name#4]\r\n  \t+- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#1] MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n\r\n\r\n=== New Plan ===\r\n\r\nWriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, eb67645e-30fc-41a8-8006-35bb7649c202, Complete, 0\r\n+- Aggregate [ds1], [ds1 AS name#4, count(1) AS count#31L]\r\n   +- Project [ds1 AS name#4]\r\n  \t+- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#1] MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n\r\n\r\n====\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Corresponding Physical Plan\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToDataSourceV2 MicroBatchWrite[epoch: 0, writer: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.sources.MemoryStreamingWrite@2b4c6242], org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.DataSourceV2Strategy$$Lambda$3143/1859075634@35709d26\r\n+- HashAggregate(keys=[ds1#39], functions=[finalmerge_count(merge count#38L) AS count(1)#30L], output=[name#4, count#31L])\r\n   +- StateStoreSave [ds1#39], state info [ checkpoint = file:/tmp/streaming.metadata-e470782a-18a3-463c-9e61-3a10d0bdf180/state, runId = 4dedecca-910c-4518-855e-456702617414, opId = 0, ver = 0, numPartitions = 5], Complete, 0, 0, 2\r\n  \t+- HashAggregate(keys=[ds1#39], functions=[merge_count(merge count#38L) AS count#38L], output=[ds1#39, count#38L])\r\n     \t+- StateStoreRestore [ds1#39], state info [ checkpoint = file:/tmp/streaming.metadata-e470782a-18a3-463c-9e61-3a10d0bdf180/state, runId = 4dedecca-910c-4518-855e-456702617414, opId = 0, ver = 0, numPartitions = 5], 2\r\n        \t+- HashAggregate(keys=[ds1#39], functions=[merge_count(merge count#38L) AS count#38L], output=[ds1#39, count#38L])\r\n           \t+- HashAggregate(keys=[ds1 AS ds1#39], functions=[partial_count(1) AS count#38L], output=[ds1#39, count#38L])\r\n              \t+- Project\r\n                 \t+- MicroBatchScan[value#1] MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR disables foldable propagation across Streaming Aggregate/Join nodes in the logical plan. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

The fix is done by separating out the \"result expressions\" from the \"aggregate expressions\" in the `Aggregate` node, and rewriting them separately.\r\n- Some QOL improvements around `With`:\r\n  - Fix aliases created by `With` expression to use the `CommonExpressionId` to avoid duplicate aliases (added a conf to fall back to old behaviour, which is useful to keep the IDs consistent for golden files tests)\r\n  - Implemented `QueryPlan.transformUpWithSubqueriesAndPruning` that the new logic depends on\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the `sql` module, some functions in `SQLImplicits` have already been marked as `deprecated` in the function comments after SPARK-19089. \r\n\r\nThis pr adds `@deprecated` type annotation marks to them. Since SPARK-19089 occurred in Spark 2.2.0, the `since` field of `@deprecated` is filled in as `2.2.0`. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, these `@deprecated` marks have also been synchronized to the corresponding functions in `SQLImplicits` in the `connect` module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMark deprecated functions with `@deprecated` in `SQLImplicits`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass Github Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExpired sessions are regularly checked and cleaned up by a maintenance thread. However, currently, this process is synchronous. Therefore, in rare cases, interrupting the execution thread of a query in a session can take hours, causing the entire maintenance process to stall, resulting in a large amount of memory not being cleared.\r\n\r\nWe address this by introducing asynchronous callbacks for execution cleanup, avoiding synchronous joins of execution threads, and preventing the maintenance thread from stalling in the above scenarios. To be more specific, instead of calling `runner.join()` in `ExecutorHolder.close()`, we set a post-cleanup function as the callback through `runner.processOnCompletion`, which will be called asynchronously once the execution runner is completed or interrupted. In this way, the maintenance thread won't get blocked on joining an execution thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases mentioned above, performance can be severely affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and a new test `Async cleanup callback gets called after the execution is closed` in `SparkConnectServiceE2ESuite.scala`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-12T08:51:07Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T12:50:01Z","closed_at":"2024-04-12T12:48:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4827cf124cd3ddbb27cd1dc741d5601842fd42e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d0bbb1f065f98e94a1a74fdbb7dfa26a29c400c0","head":{"label":"xi-db:SPARK-47819-async-cleanup","ref":"SPARK-47819-async-cleanup","sha":"d0bbb1f065f98e94a1a74fdbb7dfa26a29c400c0","user":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":757362931,"node_id":"R_kgDOLSRw8w","name":"spark","full_name":"xi-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to make `KinesisTestUtils` & `WriteInputFormatTestDataGenerator` deprecated\r\nMaster pr: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46000\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause these two classes will be moved from `main` to` test` in version `4.0`, we need to first `deprecate` them in version `3.5` to make them exit more naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-11T23:44:17Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T15:40:01Z","closed_at":"2024-04-19T15:40:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f42835df1f5a4eb7dc5bd1900632b1da3ed30e7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91ff49fcc2d5228dde619e898d4cc5f06b9017a1","head":{"label":"panbingkun:branch-3.5_deprecated","ref":"branch-3.5_deprecated","sha":"91ff49fcc2d5228dde619e898d4cc5f06b9017a1","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI am prohibiting hash functions from hashing VariantType elements.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHashing hasn't been formally implemented on VariantType elements so the current implementation crashes during execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nEarlier, when trying to hash Variant data, Spark would crash during execution. Now, the query itself wouldn't compile.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Rather, we pass it through a HKDF function to map it uniformly to a 16-byte key space.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExiting tests under:\r\n`build/sbt \"network-common/test:testOnly\"`\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n`build/sbt \"network-common/test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` by default for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is added at Apache Spark 3.0.0 and has been serving well to provide a way of ANSI SQL Standard. To improve Apache Spark SQL compatibility in an official way, we had better enable it by default from Apache Spark 4.0.0 while keeping the legacy way actively at the same time.\r\n- Apache Spark 4.0.0 is a new major version change to fit the above goal. After 4.0.0 release, it's difficult for Apache Spark community to make this kind of move in the feature releases for next 4 years.\r\n\r\nNote that the following `Spark Connector` issues should be addressed before Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n- SPARK-41794 Reenable ANSI mode in pyspark.sql.tests.connect.test_connect_column\r\n- SPARK-41547 Reenable ANSI mode in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile building the DataFrame step by step, each time a new DataFrame is generated with an empty schema, which is lazily computed on access. However, if a user's code frequently accesses the schema of these new DataFrames using methods such as `df.columns`, it will result in a large number of Analyze requests to the server. Each time, the entire plan needs to be reanalyzed, leading to poor performance, especially when constructing highly complex plans.\r\n\r\nNow, by introducing plan cache in SparkConnectPlanner, we aim to reduce the overhead of repeated analysis during this process. This is achieved by saving significant computation if the resolved logical plan of a subtree of can be cached.\r\n\r\nA minimal example of the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\r\ndf = spark.range(10)\r\nfor i in range(200):\r\n  if str(i) not in df.columns: # <-- The df.columns call causes a new Analyze request in every iteration\r\n    df = df.withColumn(str(i), F.col(\"id\") + i)\r\ndf.show() \r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the performance of the above code improved from ~110s to ~5s.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement is huge in the above cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, a static conf `spark.connect.session.planCache.maxSize` and a dynamic conf `spark.connect.session.planCache.enabled` are added.\r\n\r\n* `spark.connect.session.planCache.maxSize`: Sets the maximum number of cached resolved logical plans in Spark Connect Session. If set to a value less or equal than zero will disable the plan cache\r\n* `spark.connect.session.planCache.enabled`: When true, the cache of resolved logical plans is enabled if `spark.connect.session.planCache.maxSize` is greater than zero. When false, the cache is disabled even if `spark.connect.session.planCache.maxSize` is greater than zero. The caching is best-effort and not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSome new tests are added in SparkConnectSessionHolderSuite.scala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[SPARK-47754](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47754) introduced a new developer API called `getArrayDimension`.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands the scope of `getArrayDimension` and renames it to `updateExtraColumnMeta`. Just as their names said, `getArrayDimension` handles only one column of metadata that is the dimension of an array, while `updateExtraColumnMeta` can retrieve any type of metadata based on the given ResultSetMetadata and Connection. This is much more general and useful and reduces the number of potentially new Developer APIs in the same shape. Also the current parameters for \r\ngetArrayDimension might not be enough for other dialects\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRefactoring unreleased Developer APIs to make it more sustainable \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, unreleased API change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting ut\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nINDETERMINATE_COLLATION should only be thrown on comparison operations and memory storing of data, and we should be able to combine different implicit collations for certain operations like concat and possible others in the future.\r\nThis is why we have to add another predefined collation id named INDETERMINATE_COLLATION_ID which means that the result is a combination of conflicting non-default implicit collations. Right now it would an id of -1 so it fail if it ever goes to the CollatorFactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport for concatenation between columns of different collation is what `PGSQL` follows and this behaviour should be followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It adds new error of indeterminate collation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests in CollationSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-04-11T10:29:52Z","updated_at":"2024-08-24T00:20:49Z","closed_at":"2024-08-24T00:20:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ee88cf425b126004ecd293fe82ddcf5b90bde9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a10616fa5bc703bb17806114707275418d225d5","head":{"label":"mihailom-db:SPARK-47625","ref":"SPARK-47625","sha":"5a10616fa5bc703bb17806114707275418d225d5","user":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":756245919,"node_id":"R_kgDOLRNlnw","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailom-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support to register custom dispatch handlers when serializing objects using the provided Cloudpickle library. This is necessary to provide compatibility when executing ForEachBatch functions in structured streaming.\r\n\r\nA typical example for this behavior is the following test case:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef curried_function(df):\r\n    def inner(batch_df, batch_id):\r\n        df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"updates\")\r\n        batch_df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"batch_updates\")\r\n\r\n    return inner\r\n\r\ndf = spark.readStream.format(\"text\").load(\"python/test_support/sql/streaming\")\r\nother_df = self.spark.range(100)\r\ndf.writeStream.foreachBatch(curried_function(other_df)).start()\r\n```\r\nHere we curry a DataFrame into the function called during ForEachBatch and effectively passing state. Until now, serializing DataFrames and SparkSessions in Spark Connect was not possible since the SparkSession carries the open GPRC connection and the DataFrame itself overrides certain magic methods that make pickling fail.\r\n\r\nTo make serializing Spark Sessions possible, we register a custom session constructor, that simply returns the current active session, during the serialization of the ForEachBatch function. Now, when the ForEachBatch worker starts the execution it already creates and registers an active SparkSession. To serialize and reconstruct the DataFrame we simply have to pass in the session and the plan, the remaining attributes do not carry a permanent state.\r\n\r\nTo avoid modifying any global behavior, the serialization handlers are not registered for all cases but only when the ForEachBatch and ForEach handlers are called. This is to make sure that we don't unexpectedly change behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompatibility and Ease of Use\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplaces `t1.id = t2.id or (t1.id is null and t2.id is null)` to `t1.id <=> t2.id` in join condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove performance.\r\n`t1.id = t2.id or (t1.id is null and t2.id is null)` and `t1.id <=> t2.id` are equivalent in join condition, but the plan will be different and the performance during execution will be completely different. Id is join key in `t1.id <=> t2.id`, in `t1.id = t2.id or (t1.id is null and t2.id is null)` id cannot be used as join key, this will affect join selection and subsequent matching logic.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nsql(\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n        |CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t1 AS SELECT * FROM VALUES\r\n        |(1, 1),\r\n        |(null, 2)\r\n        |AS t1(a, b);\r\n        |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n    sql(\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n        |CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t2 AS SELECT * FROM VALUES\r\n        |(1, 10),\r\n        |(null, 20)\r\n        |AS t2(a, b);\r\n        |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n    sql(\"select t1.a,t2.b from t1 left join t2 on t1.a=t2.a or (t1.a is null and t2.a is null)\")\r\n```\r\nbefore PR is `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin`:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds support for expiring state based on TTL for MapState. Using this functionality, Spark users can specify a TTL Mode for transformWithState operator, and provide a ttlDuration for each value in MapState. Once the ttlDuration has expired, the value will not be returned as part of get() and would be cleaned up at the end of the micro-batch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed to support TTL for MapState. The PR supports specifying ttl for processing time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, modifies the MapState interface for specifying ttlDuration\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded the TransformWithMapStateTTLSuite, MapStateSuite, StatefulProcessorHandleSuite\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a debug log for Dataframe cache that uses SQL conf to turn on. It logs necessary information on\r\n* cache hit during cache application (the application happens basically on every query)\r\n* cache miss\r\n* adding new cache entries\r\n* removing cache entries (including clear all entries)\r\n\r\nBecause every query applies cache, this log could be huge and should be only turned on during some debugging process, and should not enabled by default in production.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.dataframeCache.logLevel\", \"warn\")\r\nval df = spark.range(1,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows casting another type into the variant type. The changes can be divided into two major parts:\r\n- The `VariantBuilder` class is greatly refactored. Many of its APIs are exposed so that Spark can use them to build a variant value without JSON parsing.\r\n- The actual implementation of the cast.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt provides a convenient way to build variant values from other Spark values. Before this PR, `parse_json` is the only SQL function that can produce variant values. If users want to do so, they may have to use `parse_json(to_json(input))`, which is inefficient and disallowed if the input has a scalar type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Casting to variant was previously not allowed but now allowd.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to add `-g` to javac compile parameters when using SBT package jar.\r\n\r\n> -g\r\nGenerates all debugging information, including local variables. By default, only line number and source file information is generated.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/javac.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`maven-compiler-plugin` defaults to debug=true, `plexus-compiler-javac` will add the parameter `-g`.\r\n\r\nSBT does not have this behavior by default, which leads to some differences between the jars of maven and sbt builds, although the code logic is the same.\r\n\r\nhttps://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html#debug\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/maven-compiler-plugin/blob/736da68adf543cf56cd82a68e5ad28d397ace2f4/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/plugin/compiler/AbstractCompilerMojo.java#L734\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-compiler/blob/6ae79d7f2feca3a02e75f7661468abac6a9a0a11/plexus-compilers/plexus-compiler-javac/src/main/java/org/codehaus/plexus/compiler/javac/JavacCompiler.java#L279-L285\r\n\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen parsing/reading a decimal column/field from json, jdbc, etc., if the column or field contains some values exceeding the excepted precision, we only get a simple error like `Decimal precision <precision> exceeds max precision <maxPrecision>.`. This kind of message is sufficient for finding issues when dealing with literals or DDL schemas, but insufficient for reading or parsing values for storage systems.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the message to `The <roundedValue> rounded half up from <originalValue> cannot be represented as Decimal(<precision>, <scale>).`\r\n\r\nThe `roundedValue` represents the value after applying the `scale`, as we do HALF_UP, the integral length might be different from the original values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Currently, we use DataTypeErrors instead of QueryExecutionErrors for Decimal.apply which is used extensively on the execution side.\r\n- Enrich the error message for better debugging experience \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, error class and message changes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimpleDataSourceStreamReader is a simplified version of the DataSourceStreamReader interface.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 functions that needs to be defined \r\n\r\n1. Read data and return the end offset.\r\n_def read(self, start: Offset) -> (Iterator[Tuple], Offset)_\r\n\r\n2. Read data between start and end offset, this is required for exactly once read.\r\n_def readBetweenOffset(self, start: Offset, end: Offset) -> Iterator[Tuple]_\r\n\r\n3. initial start offset of the streaming query.\r\n_def initialOffset() -> dict_\r\n\r\nThe implementation wrap the SimpleDataSourceStreamReader instance in a DataSourceStreamReader that prefetch and cache data in latestOffset. The record prefetched in python process will be sent to JVM as arrow record batches in planInputPartitions() and cached by block manager and read by partition reader from executor later..\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompared to DataSourceStreamReader interface, the simplified interface has some advantages.\r\nIt doesn’t require developers to reason about data partitioning.\r\nIt doesn’t require getting the latest offset before reading data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit test and integration test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-10T07:04:08Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T19:11:01Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T13:08:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4478c21cc744094d660ebf310f8a3dd3d7517cb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe special case SELECT DISTINCT (*) to become SELECT DISTINCT *\r\nThis prevents (*) to be treated as struct(*).\r\nWe used to ignore parens around stars (*) everywhere, but that is inconsistent with e.g. (c1, c2).\r\nHowever there seems to be a reasonable number of users treating DISTINCT as a function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPrevent regression for a common weird case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, It undoes a user changing change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLevenshtein distance requires modifications to accommodate collated inputs properly:\r\n- Allow collated inputs in `inputTypes`\r\n- Require same collations for input types in `CollationTypeCasts`\r\n- Comparison of byte substrings of `UTF8String` for equality is not enough anymore; we split checks of substrings (character) equality into classes for binary equality and semantic equality, latter is used with collations which don't support binary equality checks\r\n- Each collation gets substring equality checks statically in collation factory to reduce object allocation on each Levenshtein distance evaluation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo support Levenshtein distance expression with collations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it changes behavior of Levenshtein distance expression when evaluated on collated strings.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded checks to `CollationStringExpressionsSuite` in addition to handful of existing Levenshtein checks.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR merges the `TimeoutMode` and `TTLMode` parameter for `transformWithState` into a single `TimeMode`. Currently, users need to specify the notion of time (ProcessingTime/EventTime) for timers and ttl separately. This allows users to use a single parameter. \r\n\r\nWe do not expect users to use mix/match EventTime/ProcessingTime for timers and ttl in a single query because it makes hard to reason about the time semantics (when will timer be fired?, when will the state be evicted? etc.). Its simpler to stick to one notion of time throughout timers and ttl. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChanges are needed to simplify Arbitrary State API `transformWithState` interface by merging TTLMode/TimeoutMode into a single TimeMode. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this PR changes the API parameters for `transformWithState`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAll existing testcases for `transformWithState` API pass. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool

It has a regression that also disabled reading negative scale decimals from JDBC data sources. **Although there is a legacy config to restore the old behavior**, it seemed neither designed for such a case nor convenient in a data pipeline that extracts negative scale decimals from a database such as Oracle to Parquet files w/o negative scale decimal support.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Postgres has the negative scale decimals support since v15, which was one of the supporters for disabling negative scale decimals on our side.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we change the schema from `decimal(p,s)` to `decimal(p-s,0)` if s<0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

For negative scale the least significant digit is on the left side of the decimal point, because the actual data is rounded to the specified number of places to the left of the decimal point. For example, a specification of (10,-2) means to round to hundreds.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Postgres\r\n> Beginning in PostgreSQL 15, it is allowed to declare a numeric column with a negative scale. Then values will be rounded to the left of the decimal point. The precision still represents the maximum number of non-rounded digits. Thus, a column declared as\r\nNUMERIC(2, -3)\r\nwill round values to the nearest thousand and can store values between -99000 and 99000, inclusive. It is also allowed to declare a scale larger than the declared precision. Such a column can only hold fractional values, and it requires the number of zero digits just to the right of the decimal point to be at least the declared scale minus the declared precision. For example, a column declared as\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change make the classes generated by catalyst:\r\n1. Stable across different runs. The generated code does not contain random numbers that come from lambda-proxy names (`0x<address>`).\r\n2. Uniquely named. The name uniqueness is achieved by adding the hash code of the generated code to the class name. The generated classes are now named `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$<codeHash>` instead of `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass`.\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes were needed to allow running Spark SQL workloads on [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it removes the random number from the lambda-proxy name in the UDF failure error message. Before this change:\r\n```\r\n[FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF] Failed to execute user defined function (QueryExecutionErrorsSuite$$Lambda$970/0x181260145: (string, int) => string).\r\n```\r\nAfter this change:\r\n```\r\n[FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF] Failed to execute user defined function (nextChar in QueryExecutionErrorsSuite$$Lambda$970: (string, int) => string).\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe test cases for this code path were already introduced in the following [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41599). This PR modifies these tests to check for the new format.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo!","created_at":"2024-04-09T09:27:49Z","updated_at":"2024-10-13T05:17:58Z","closed_at":"2024-10-13T00:26:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53ba4e3247f2f6c00274b8809797cbddc5d8a207","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f7f980d11f9462ae6a4ed99ac55aca1ba07be92","head":{"label":"vjovanov:vj/unique-stable-generated-code","ref":"vj/unique-stable-generated-code","sha":"5f7f980d11f9462ae6a4ed99ac55aca1ba07be92","user":{"login":"vjovanov","id":352820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjgyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/352820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov","html_url":"https://github.com/vjovanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777236977,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlOx8Q","name":"spark","full_name":"vjovanov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vjovanov","id":352820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjgyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/352820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov","html_url":"https://github.com/vjovanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjovanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vjovanov/spark","description":"Apache
