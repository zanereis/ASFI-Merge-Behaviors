Added 2 more chrome options so that the interactive notebook screendiff integration tests work within docker.\r\n2. Updated the golden screenshot.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n1. By default, Docker runs a container with a /dev/shm shared memory space 64MB. This is typically too small for Chrome and will cause Chrome to crash when rendering large pages. To fix, run the container with docker run --shm-size=1gb to increase the size of /dev/shm. Since Chrome 65, this is no longer necessary. Instead, launch the browser with the --disable-dev-shm-usage flag\r\n2. Without the chrome options, a test running within docker container will fail with following error: \r\n![TKBKbwCxjwm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4423149/80133719-7ed62f80-8552-11ea-8184-6f694c7190a6.png)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This led to the number of state cells to reach Short.MAX_VALUE, the\r\nmaximum of supported Flink states.\r\n\r\nThis change keeps a fixed number of state cells depending on the maximum\r\nconfigured parallelism for checkpoints.

makes GBK into a primitive and moves the current implementation -- only used by the DirectRunner -- as a PTransformOverride for the DirectRunner. This leaves the apply_GroupByKey because there are some internal runners that rely on the existence of the transform. So we keep it but simply apply the GBK normally. This can be removed after an internal fix.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

And if defer mu.Unlock() isn't used (or as in this case, able to be used), always unlock before returning the error.\r\n\r\nDeadlocks can prevent the error case you're returning from being transmitted.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for that new code, since harness.go is woefully under unit tested, though due to deadlocks being unverifyable (and could cause test timeouts), a specific test for that hasn't been added.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds a `MillisInstant` logical type, and replaces all usages of the primitive `DATETIME` type with it.\r\n\r\n`MillisInstant` mirrors the `NanosInstant` type. It uses `org.joda.time.Instant` rather than `java.time.Instant` for consistency with `DATETIME`, and it is backed by an `INT64` representing the number of milliseconds since the epoch.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the changes in this PR are relatively trivial, but there are a few significant (and some potentially controversial) ones:\r\n- Updates the datetime getter/setter functions generated in `ByteBuddyUtils` to produce and consume instances of `Long` rather than `Instant`. This is necessary because these functions are expected to produce/consume the base type for logical types.\r\n- Updates all joda time literals in schema inference tests so they specify a timezone.\r\n- Throughout the SQL module I've replaced references to `getBaseValue` with `getValue`. Previously the only logical types used in SQL were `PassThroughLogicalType` instances, where the input type and base type were the same.\r\n\r\nChanges that are not currently included in this PR but we might consider:\r\n- Replace all references to `DateTime` (`addDateTimeField`, `addDateTimeValue`, ..) with `Instant`, and deprecate or remove the `DateTime` references.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

moves the DataflowRunner apply_Read to a PTransformOverride implementation. In order for Dataflow to pick the correct coder for the generated ParallelRead step, we set the output PCollection element_type to the coder's type hint. The BigQuerySource by default uses the RowAsDictJsonCoder. This PR also implements the to_type_hint for that coder.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

I33908eab8313a90829a2115029f87b7f2f454f1b\r\n\r\nThe TestStream read from GRPC method didn't have a timeout and had the possibility of hanging indefinitely. This adds a 30s inactivity timeout. This also fixes the StreamingCache waiting for file timeout which didn't work.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't necessarily fix BEAM-9767 because it looks more like a problem interacting with the test environment. This will make it so that the test times out after 30s instead of 600s.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
