PR provides a new \"unified\" implementation of a translator for Flink capable of translating all workflows, portable or not, streaming and batch.\r\n\r\nIt replaced the 4 implementations that currently exist with the following advantages:\r\n\r\n- Uses the new `DataStream` API rather that the deprecated `DataSet`.\r\n- Uses the new Flink source implementation rather that the deprecated `InputFormat` and `SourceFunction`\r\n- Easier to maintain. There's a lot of overlap between the existing implementation and code is largely copy pasted from each other (with subtle accidental variations)\r\n  \r\nfixes https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/28617\r\n\r\n- [x] Use Unified translator for native streaming pipelines\r\n- [x] Use Unified translator for native batch pipelines when `--useDataStreamForBatch` is passed\r\n- [x] Use Unified translator for portable streaming pipelines\r\n- [ ] Use Unified translator for portable batch pipelines\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR closes #28708. It defines and implements a mock quota aware API.  See PR branch's [.test-infra/mock-apis/README](https://github.com/damondouglas/beam/tree/rrio/testing/api/.test-infra/mock-apis) for more details.\r\n\r\nNotes for the reviewer:\r\n1. The TL;DR of this PR is that it allows us to write Beam tests using an API we can control i.e. the size of the quota, the contract, etc. It hosts both HTTP and gRPC with one codebase.\r\n1. I recommend you start the review at [.test-infra/mock-apis/src/main/go/cmd/service/refresher/main.go](https://github.com/damondouglas/beam/blob/rrio/testing/api/.test-infra/mock-apis/src/main/go/cmd/service/refresher/main.go) and [.test-infra/mock-apis/src/main/go/cmd/service/refresher/main.go](https://github.com/damondouglas/beam/blob/rrio/testing/api/.test-infra/mock-apis/src/main/go/cmd/service/echo/main.go)\r\n1. I attempted integration tests using testcontainers but given the various dependencies the test code was unreadable and had several race conditions. #28859 addresses the need for integration tests and Infrastructure-as-Code setup to make this cleaner.\r\n1. The src/main/go path is to be compatible with other proto generated code. This PR includes src/main/java proto generated code. Python needs some further research as it didn't seem as straightforward. Python tests could call the HTTP endpoint directly.\r\n1. To make the `./gradlew :beam-test-infra-mock-apis:check` happy, I had to add some suppress configurations that weren't relevant for this project. If this project were to use the gradle plugin for proto generation, it wouldn't play as nicely with Go, which is arguably more important.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes the Reshuffle default implementation to preserve all metadata and be a true no-op, whereas before it did not preserve the pane info.\r\n\r\nRegarding update compatibility, my understanding of runners that have long-lived streaming jobs and perform updates, as of this writing:\r\n\r\n - Flink: overrides Reshuffle\r\n - Samza: overrides Reshuffle\r\n - Dataflow v1: overrides Reshuffle\r\n - Dataflow v2: executes default implementation\r\n\r\nI went ahead and used the update compatibility flag anyhow just in case, so it can be reverted to exactly the old implementation on demand.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26234\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of the #26645.\r\n\r\nAs part of the previous PR an issue with displaying the GA Post-Commits Status dashboard was fixed.\r\nThis PR fixes the data retrieving approach and the following changes have been added:\r\n- Fixed the problem with links to workflows and their run results\r\n- Sequential requests have been changed to simultaneous asynchronous requests\r\n- Added a backoff mechanism with on-the-fly token changes to overcome throttling issues\r\n- Use access token to have authenticated requests to increase the rate limit threshold\r\n\r\nThe changes are deployed and the dashboard is up-to-date: http://metrics.beam.apache.org/d/CTYdoxP4z/ga-post-commits-status?orgId=1\r\n\r\n### How has it been tested?\r\n\r\nTested on the local machine.\r\n\r\n1. Follow the [instruction](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Community+Metrics#CommunityMetrics-GrafanaUI) to deploy and configure a Grafana instance locally\r\n2. Go to the `beamsyncgithub` container: `docker exec -it \"beamsyncgithub\" bash`\r\n3. Pull out data from GitHub by running the sync script `python ./sync_workflows.py`\r\n4. Go to the `GA Post-Commits Status` Grafana dashboard and verify that data is displayed\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Add interfaces/classes for direct path:\r\n**ProcessWorkItemClient**\r\nExposed to `WorkItemProcessor` to give access to route GetData and CommitWork stream RPCs to the same workers where GetWork was called (currently `StreamingDataflowWorker#process`). \r\n\r\n**WorkItemProcessor**\r\nReplaces `WorkItemReceiver`, same but takes and exposes `ProcessWorkItemClient` instead of `WorkItem`.  Since  `ProcessWorkItemClient` needs a way to get data for work, refresh work, get side input data, and commit work, the place where its created (`GrpcGetWorkStream`) needs to be modified to accept GetDataStream (for keyed/state data), GetDataStream (global side input data), and a CommitWorkStream.\r\n\r\n**GetWorkBudget**\r\nA struct to model `item` and `byte` budgets for how much work a user worker can handle.  This is passed in `GetWorkRequest`(s) to Windmill to control how many items/bytes of `Work` is returned.\r\n\r\n**GetWorkBudgetDistributor**\r\nGiven a set of `WindmillStreamSender`(s) and `GetWorkBudget`, distributes the budgets to the `WindmillStreamSender`(s) in some manner.  \r\n\r\n**EvenGetWorkBudgetDistributor**\r\n`GetWorkBudgetDistributor` implementation that distributes the budget evenly\r\n\r\n\r\n**WindmillStreamSender**\r\nWhen the `Grpc*Stream`(s) are created, they immediately start the underlying grpc stream (`startStream` is called, and has protected access).  To be able to assign budgets and get the streams ready to be started (similar to `GetWorkClientSender`), `WindmillStreamSender` wraps the 3 WorkItem API RPC streams, and exposes a `startStream`, and `closeAllStreams` to manage the underlying streams. Once the streams are started they are cached (via thread safe memoization).  Once certain endpoints are stale, the `closeAllStreams` gives a way to close all of the underlying streams un a `WindmillStreamSender` instance.   This will also be an interface to adjust budget in the `GetWorkStream` as well as track windmill/backend worker `backlog` in the future.\r\n\r\n**DispatcherClient**\r\nManages/vends out stubs and the dispatcher\r\nThread safe via synchronization on reads and writes.\r\n\r\nAdd **StreamingEngineClient**\r\n- Manages the available backend Windmill workers via `GetWorkerMetadata`.  We never close this stream.  WorkerMetadata updates are then submitted to a single threaded executor which will consume it, and update `StreamingEngineClient` internal connections state\r\n- Given a total budget, divides it amongst the available backend Windmill workers (represented as `Endpoints`, `Connections`, and `WindmillStreamSenders`) starts `GetWorkStream`(s).  Closes streams via `WindmillStreamSender#closeAllStreams` when the endpoint for the stream is not available in updated worker metadata.\r\n- Contains single threaded executor for triggered budget refreshes.  Budget refreshes are triggered when new worker metadata is consumed (implemented), work has completed processing (either has been committed back to windmill or put in an un-active state).  Uses a `SynchronousQueue` to implement a publish/subscribe pattern. `put` blocks until another thread `take(s)` from the queue.\r\n- Contains single threaded executor for periodic budget refreshes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture changes need still:\r\n- Have `GrpcGetWorkStream` accept a `GrpcGetDataStream` and `GrpcCommitWorkStream` so that it can construct a `ProcessWorkItemClient` and pass it onto the `ProcessWorkItem` (replaces  current behavior where`WorkItem` being passed to the `WorkItemReceiver`).\r\n- Integrate with `StreamingDataflowWorker`, might be worth having 2 different implementations of `StreamingDataflowWorker` since current `MetricTrackingWindmillServer` is used for `GetData` (keyed and global) fetches.\r\n- Need to figure out a way to batch commits since they need to go to the same origin worker\r\n\r\nR: @scwhittle \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
