introduced Op strategy has disabled conversion from NHWC to NCHW in AlterOpLayout (which is correct thing to do). We can solve this problem by calling ConvertLayout in the parser if needed. However, this only works for FP32.\r\n\r\nFor quantized models, parsers give a QNN graph. And this QNN graph goes to relay.build. Relay build internally calls QNN Legalize passes to convert it to Relay-only ops. The problem is ConvertLayout does not work on QNN ops. Therefore, even if we call ConvertLayout after parser, the layouts will not change.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements ConvertLayout for QNN ops. In addition, I have changed the interface of FInferCorrectLayout to ingest an array of Relay Types instead of shapes. This is helpful in operators like Concatenate where we need to know the number of input data tensors.\r\n\r\n@icemelon9 @zhiics @yzhliu

we were falling back to fp32 op for add/mul/concatenate, because the accuracy on mobilenet v2 would drop if we use QNN's add for torch `quantized::add`, and also that is the way Torch internally implements some of quantized ops currently. \r\n\r\nBut I found that the accuracy loss was due to a different reason (turned our for mobilenet v2 only, torchvision people trained it with quantization aware training, and I was doing post training calibration on top of it). Now that the accuracy loss was fixed in a proper way, we don't need to piggy back to fp32 ops like Torch does. No loss of accuracy after this change.\r\n\r\nplease review @anijain2305 \r\ncc @jwfromm @jjohnson-arm

PR implements a Relay pass that annotates target device. Different from the existing annotation target pass (#4933), this pass implements the algorithm RFC proposed by @mbaret (https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/relay-improved-graph-partitioning-algorithm/5830). In short, it greedy merges supported ops and minimizes the number of generated subgraphs.\r\n\r\nSome highlights and lowlights for this PR:\r\n- The pass is general in terms of supporting multiple targets. We can use [\"dnnl\", \"trt\"], for example to annotate the graph.\r\n- The pass uses lots of utility functions which are supposed to be removed after https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-annotation-defined-subgraphs/5934 has been implemented.\r\n- This pass supports multiple outputs, but the subgraph with multiple outputs cannot be partitioned at this moment because we haven't supported multiple outputs in the partition pass.\r\n- The unit test uses exactly the same example used in the RFC. The \"add\" nodes are blue nodes while \"substrate\" are red nodes in the RFC figure.\r\n- I marked \"substrate\" as a non-support op to demonstrate how this pass works, but we need a more suitable way to do so.\r\n\r\nHere is the example graph:\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%in_1: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_2: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_3: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_4: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_5: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_6: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_7: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_8: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_9: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_10: Tensor[(10, 10), float32]) -> Tensor[(10, 10), float32] {\r\n  %0 = add(%in_1, %in_2) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %1 = add(%in_3, %in_4) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %2 = add(%0, %1) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %3 = subtract(%in_5, %in_6) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %4 = subtract(%in_7, %3) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %5 = add(%2, %4) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %6 = subtract(%in_8, %5) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %7 = add(%in_9, %5) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %8 = add(%6, %7) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  add(%in_10, %8) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter annotation with merge:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%in_1: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_2: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_3: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_4: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_5: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_6: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_7: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_8: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_9: Tensor[(10, 10), float32], %in_10: Tensor[(10, 10), float32]) -> Tensor[(10, 10), float32] {\r\n  %0 = annotation.compiler_begin(%in_10, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][0]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %1 = annotation.compiler_begin(%in_1, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][1]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %2 = annotation.compiler_begin(%in_2, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][2]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %3 = add(%1, %2) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %4 = annotation.compiler_begin(%in_3, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][3]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %5 = annotation.compiler_begin(%in_4, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][4]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %6 = add(%4, %5) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %7 = add(%3, %6) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %8 = subtract(%in_5, %in_6) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %9 = subtract(%in_7, %8) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %10 = annotation.compiler_begin(%9, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][5]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %11 = add(%7, %10) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %12 = annotation.compiler_end(%11, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][6]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %13 = subtract(%in_8, %12) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %14 = annotation.compiler_begin(%13, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][7]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %15 = annotation.compiler_begin(%in_9, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][8]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %16 = add(%15, %11) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %17 = annotation.compiler_end(%16, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][9]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %18 = annotation.compiler_begin(%17, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][10]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %19 = add(%14, %18) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  %20 = add(%0, %19) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */;\r\n  annotation.compiler_end(%20, meta[relay.attrs.CompilerAttrs][11]) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), float32] */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll need to clean up the code and refactor the unit test before it can be reviewed and merged.

commmit adds support for adding prologue and/or epilogue function calls for a code block via the pragma schedule.  A dummy use can be found here: https://gist.github.com/KireinaHoro/c959170557d75d81c52c116c3750d78a\r\n\r\nThe addition is proposed to support better control in the generated code when using the tensorize and inline asm flows to do codegen for something like [Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini), which requires explicit `fence` instructions to block the execution flow until data has been fully flushed back to DRAM.  With this change an external function that does the `fence` can be placed in the epilogue of a computation.  The prologue pragma may be useful in similar situations when a device needs some sort of initialization, and is added for

has been quite a few recent changes that depends heavily on\r\nthe function attr interface. This PR streamlines that interface by introducing\r\ntwo APIs that covers most of the usages.\r\n\r\nThanks to @jroesch for discussing the API naming convention.\r\n\r\n- GetAttr which gets a typed object for a given key\r\n  - HasNonzeroAttr is a quick helper that calls GetAttr to quickly check an attribute\r\n- WithAttr that creates a new function object with the given attr\r\n  - The API comes with copy on write optimization to avoid multiple copies\r\n  - We deliberately pick the prefix With(instead of Set) to indicate this\r\n    function does not mutate the original input.\r\n\r\nOn the python side:\r\n- We allow read access via func.attrs (which is a DictAttr)\r\n    e.g. `func.attrs[\"__param__\"]` \r\n- func.with_attrs to create a new instance with updated attrs.\r\n\r\nWe also get rid of the small wrapper functions and make sure the API centered around\r\nthe GetAttr and HasNonzeroAttr interface.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes the function construction to

observe that in lots of tensorflow models used in our production environment, some operators share the same node as their attributes. For example, there might be two \"tf.reduce_mean\" operators each with its own \"axis\" attribute. Their \"axis\" attributes can take the same \"tf.constant\" node. In this case, different operators share the same node as attributes. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the current tensorflow frontend of relay, such sharing of the same param among different operators is not supported. For example, in the current implementation of \"_get_param\" function in \"python/tvm/relay/frontend/tensorflow.py\", the corresponding param will be deleted permanently using \"pop\" from the \"_params\" dictionary after being checked in \"_get_param\" function. In this case, if another operator needs to check the same param as its attribute, that param will not be found. Hence, the current implementation of the tensorflow frontend cannot support param sharing among different operators.   \r\n\r\nIn order to support the case of param sharing among operators, we modify the tensorflow frontend. We leverage on the python decorator method. Everytime \"_get_param\" is called, instead of deleting the corresponding visited param as in the current implementation, we record it into a \"used_params\" dictionary and keep it in the original \"_params\" dictionary, so that another operator can still visit it in the following process. Then after the whole relay graph completes building, we delete the params have been visited in \"used_params\" from \"_params\" to generate the final \"_params\" output.\r\n\r\nCompared to the old implementation ,our new implementation doesn't delete the visited params immediately in \"_get_param\", but records them and deletes them at the final step. In this way, the case where different operators share the same param can be supported.  \r\n \r\nAny suggestions are welcome! @tqchen

we are incrementally adding more and more passes to Relay. It makes sense to separate these passes into `analysis` and `transforms` namespaces. This makes the code cleaner and easy to find the pass that users want. In addition, commercial compilers like LLVM also organize the passes similarly.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly separates the C++ side and creates `analysis` and `transforms` under passes. A followup PR will refactor the Python side.\r\n\r\nSome discussion about this is here: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-annotation-defined-subgraphs/5934/4\r\n\r\nCC @tqchen @jroesch @icemelon9

For example `tir.const(2) % 0`. \r\n\r\n## Rounding intrinsics\r\nWhen I tried to use llvm intrinsics on integers I found all of them but `popcount` result in an error analogous to:\r\n```\r\nTVMError: LLVM module verification failed with the following errors: \r\nIntrinsic has incorrect return type!\r\ni32 (i32)* @llvm.floor.i32\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this for `trunc,floor,ceil,nearbyint,round` it is sufficient to return the int expr and avoid the call altogether.\r\n\r\n## Other intrinsics\r\n\r\nI was looking at fixing the above crash for other intrinsics (`sin,cos,atan,tan,tanh,sigmoid,log,erf,exp,sqrt,rsqrt`) by restricting their usage to floating point numbers. However applying `exp` and `sqrt` to `bool` type seems to be relied on in this test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/topi/tests/python/test_topi_reduce.py#L51\r\n\r\nEvaluating this line for a bool is equivalent to a tautology which makes me suspect it is not intended. If the reviewer(s) agree that these intrinsics should not be applied to ints, then I can add a front-end checks on the instrinsics to this PR and fix the tests.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a review!\r\n\r\n@tqchen

Previously TVM's front-end would accept a statement such as `tvm.tir.sqrt(tvm.tir.const(3,'int32'))` and then the llvm backend would fail to verify with the message:\r\n```\r\nTVMError: LLVM module verification failed with the following errors: \r\nIntrinsic has incorrect return type!\r\ni32 (i32)* @llvm.sqrt.i32\r\n```\r\nThis is due to many of the intrinsics being defined only for floating point types. \r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is to raise a Python RuntimeError for the intrinsics `sin,cos,atan,tan,tanh,sigmoid,log,erf,exp,sqrt,rsqrt`.\r\n\r\nFor the intrinsics `round,trunc,ceil,floor,nearbyint` they simply returns the passed argument. For example `tvm.tir.floor(tvm.tir.const(10)) #prints 10`.\r\n\r\n## Divide by Zero Core Dump\r\n\r\nIt appears that a few cases of dividing by zero were missed causing const_fold to trigger a floating point exception in python. For example `tvm.tir.const(2) % 0\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a review!\r\n\r\n@tqchen

All function level passes are handled directly from the pass manager. A few module level passes needs to detect if a function uses default compiler or not.

Motivation and Summary\r\n\r\n`LocalRunner`, which measures the runtime of an op with a certain schedule config on the host machine directly, is one of the two runners in AutoTVM. However, `LocalRunner` was derived from `RPCRunner` and launched a local RPC server. The reason for this implementation was to have a unified interface and logic for both runners, but it introduces two problems:\r\n\r\n1. Overhead.\r\nAlthough local RPC session doesn't really have to send the built binary via network, it still has 1) the RPC connection overhead, and 2) an additional binary copy overhead (`RPCRunner` will upload the locally built binary to remote RPC server. In the local RPC case, it means a copy from `/tmp`to `pwd`). \r\n\r\n2. Reliability.\r\nAs many people have reported in the discuss, the local RPC connection may be dropped or unstable. One possible reason may come from the tornado package but it's hard to be identified and fixed. Anyway, when we are using `LocalRunner`, it doesn't make any sense to see an error or warning regrad to RPC connection.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors AutoTVM `Runner` and fully decouples `LocalRunner` and `RPCRunner`. In summary:\r\n* Now both `LocalRunner` and `RPCRunner` are derived from `Runner`.\r\n* Common logic and interfaces such as \"prepare golden reference for correctness checking\" and \"run N configs in parallel\" are lifted to base `Runner` class.\r\n* Each derived runner only needs to specify how to acquire TVM context (local or remote) and how to run oneconfig.\r\n* No change on the user interfaces and APIs.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\nSince user interface and underlying measurement remain the same, I just tested the first task extracted from ResNet-18 on CPU for evaluation. Both tests use `LocalRunner`.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Task  1/12]  Current/Best:   20.81/ 169.89 GFLOPS | Progress: (252/252) | 556.76 s Done\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Task  1/12]  Current/Best:   17.89/ 150.35 GFLOPS | Progress: (252/252) | 192.78 s Done\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I think the performance difference should be due to the measurement error, we can clearly see that this PR is capable of reducing the tuning time.\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nFor VTA using `RPCRunner`, it will reprogram FPGA every time before a measurement, but I am not sure if we still need this step for the real local runner. Please help review and provide your suggestions (cc @tmoreau89).\r\n\r\n@merrymercy @eqy @kevinthesun please help to review.

observe a great amount of tensorflow models used in our production environment invoke the FusedBatchNorm operator, and a lot of them use this operator in \"is_training\" mode for model inference. In \"is_training\" mode, the mean and variance are calculated dynamically using the run-time data without pre-defined. However, the current BatchNorm in TVM requires the mean and variance are given as non-empty tensors. \r\n\r\nWe add the support for BatchNorm in \"is_training\" mode, to make it able to dynamically calculate the mean and variance if not given. We first check the mean node and variance node for fused_batch_norm in tensorflow frontend to annotate them if they are empty. Then according to the annotation, we add necessary nodes for the mean and variance calculation in BatchNormToInferUnpack function, which is used to arrange the BatchNorm inference.\r\n\r\nIn our current implementation, the annotations of the empty mean and variance are added into the name_hint of the corresponding variable nodes. This solution is simple and no need to modify the attributes of the relay operator batch_norm. Alternatively, we can add a bool attribute \"is_training\" to the relay operator batch_norm. If the mean and variance are empty, \"is_training\" is set to true. Then according to the attributes of the relay operator, we decide whether to add the nodes for calculating the mean and variance or not in function BatchNormToInferUnpack. This solution needs to modify the relay operator batch_norm.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcome! @tqchen

allocated via cudaMallocHost is supposed to be faster at transferring data to/from a cuda device, and it was not implemented in the tvm runtime.\r\n\r\nThe DeviceAPIs treat DLDeviceTypes as their own device, so kDLCPUPinned felt a little bit out of place because it was sort of a kDLCPU (host memory) but really it was owned by a kDLGPU (cuda api).\r\n\r\nI felt the least complicated path was to register an alias for \"device_api.gpu\" as \"device_api.cpu_pinned\" and implement the kDLCPUPinned logic in CUDADeviceAPI.\r\n\r\nSome small checks also needed to be modified.  Not sure if I missed any.\r\n\r\nOpen to suggestions if my implementation is way off.","created_at":"2020-03-04T19:55:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T02:39:58Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T02:39:42Z","merged_at":"2020-03-10T02:39:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd39c5c09ca3d2de0822d1dffcbae2374a023ae5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

adds support for converting quantized models from torch to Relay via QNN. I believe this makes a good case for introducing Torch frontend to TVM, since the quantized Torch models -> ONNX path is not supported at the moment (or any time soon). Also torch cannot run quantized models on GPU yet, but we can run quantized models on CUDA very fast.\r\n\r\nSo far I've tested on quantized models from torchvision available at https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/torchvision/models/quantization (shufflenet is removed since it has issues with tracing), and a custom mobilenet v3 model.\r\n\r\nPer channel quantization is fully supported, and it is a big win on mobilenet v3 (more than 10 point accuracy on imagenet). I think even TFLite or MXNet + QNN doesn't support per channel quantization end to end.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains \r\n* The converter to QNN\r\n* Tests for individual quantized modules\r\n* Tests on pretrained imagenet models with dummy calibration\r\n\r\nVerifying the result is tricky due to difference in numerics between torch and tvm. \r\n\r\nQuantized modules tests are run but there is no assertion on how close the raw floating point output is to torch. I dumped some statistics that we can eye ball and verify that the result is reasonable.\r\n\r\n For imagenet tests, I use the real image and verify that two top3 label sets are identical. Here, I'm ignoring the order among top3, but for the 4 models that I added in the test, the order is actually correct. The order is ignored to make CI less fragile.\r\n\r\nBelow is the result on 1k subset of imagenet val data with full calibration + per channel quantization. I've prepared a repo to do the same evaluation [here](https://github.com/Edgecortix-Inc/pytorch_quantization/tree/master/tvm_qnn_evaluation). You can also use the full imagenet dataset, if you have an access to it.\r\n\r\nmodel name | Torch-Top1 | Torch-Top5 | TVM-Top1 | TVM-Top5\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nresnet18 | 69.7 | 90.2 | 70.0 |
