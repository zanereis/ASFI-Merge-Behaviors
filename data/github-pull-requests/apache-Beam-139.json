used the UnboundedSourceFunction as a guide to implementing the bundle finalization hook for the DoFnOperator.\r\nSince checkpointing support is only supported when using shutdownSourcesAfterIdleMs so I added a new validates runner task that runs a subset of the tests that rely on bundle finalization.\r\n\r\nI also added support for Impulse translation for non-portable streaming pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis is the base for swapping over non-portable Flink to use SDF instead of UnboundedSources.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

I660b98ac7cd562eb03aab6d15d829eae8726ebad\r\n\r\nThe following API changes the way that the Interactive Runner caches\r\ndata from unbounded sources. Previously, a user-configurable duration\r\nwould run a \"Background Caching Job\" that would cache all elements from\r\nunbounded source. Then, the user pipeline would run by reading from\r\nthat cache after completion. Now, there is a long lived \"Background\r\nRecording Job\". This replaces the caching job with a background pipeline\r\nthat records elements from the unbounded sources and most importantly\r\ndoes not block user pipeline execution.\r\n\r\nThe following APIs have changed:\r\nshow(*pcolls, include_window_info=False, visualize_data=False) -->\r\nshow(*pcolls, n='inf', duration='inf', include_window_info=False, visualize_data=False)\r\n\r\nThe show() command was modified to include a max number of elements and\r\na max duration of elements to read. The show() command will end when\r\neither of the limiters gets triggered, whichever comes first. If a\r\nlimiter is not supplied it is assumed to be infinite. For example,\r\nshow(pcoll, n=5000) will read and block until 5000 elements are read.\r\ncollect(pcoll, include_window_info=False) -->\r\ncollect(pcoll, n='inf', duration='inf', include_window_info=False)\r\n\r\nThe collect() command was modified to include a max number of elements and\r\na max duration of elements to read. The collect() command will end when\r\neither of the limiters gets triggered, whichever comes first. If a\r\nlimiter is not supplied it is assumed to be infinite. For example,\r\nshow(pcoll, n=5000) will read and block until 5000 elements are read.\r\n\r\nhead() was removed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The main purpose of this commit is upgrading spanner library to 1.59.0, but to upgrade it, I need to also upgrade bigtable_client_core to 1.16.0 and other dependencies;\r\n2. Update spanner type parser to be able to recognize NUMERIC.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n1. I have run \"/bin/bash sdks/java/build-tools/beam-linkage-check.sh\" and confirmed that there is no linkage errors.\r\n2.

change introduces a new builder function (`withIsDeleteFn`) with `ElasticsearchIO.Write` which can be used to effectively delete documents from the Elasticsearch index. Previously, ElasticsearchIO only supports upsert operations within an index but it is impossible to delete documents.\r\n\r\n**Why**\r\nBy using the `withIsDeleteFn` function, the apache beam user can dynamically decide the bulk operation to be carried out for the document. Mostly, in streaming update environment, it might happen that some of the previously indexed document needs to be deleted based on some conditions but the current version of ElasticsearchIO doesn't support delete operation and hence many users end up writing empty document for those IDs. This might have a major memory space issue while Elasticsearch's segment merging to free up deleted document's allocated memory.\r\n\r\n**JIRA Ticket**\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5757\r\n\r\nR: @echauchot @jbonofre @timrobertson100 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a new method that replaces `PTransformOverride.get_replacement_transform()`. This new method provides access to the `AppliedPTransform` when constructing the replacement transform, whereas the old method only provides access to the `PTransform`.\r\n\r\n- Introduces `PTransformOverride.get_replacement_transform_for_applied_ptransform(self, applied_ptransform)`. The user can override this to provide a replacement `PTransform` using the input `AppliedPTransform`.\r\n- Provides a default implementation of this method that calls `PTransformOverride.get_replacement_transform()` for backwards compatibility.\r\n- Deprecates `PTransformOverride.get_replacement_transform()`.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

`PTransformOverride` only supports overriding `PTransform` s that have a single input. This change adds support for multiple main inputs and side inputs.\r\n\r\nThe change introduces a new method `PTransformOverride.get_replacement_inputs(self, applied_ptransform)` that can be overridden by end users. This method will be called to get the inputs for the replacement `PTransform.` The default implementation will return a tuple of all the main inputs in order, concatenated with the all the side inputs

ZetaSQL implementation does not handle JOIN statement with WITH queries properly. It calculated the incorrect reference column indices. For example, if we run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH t1 AS (select 1 AS k), t2 AS (select 1 AS k), t3 AS (select 1 AS k)\r\nSELECT COUNT(*)\r\nFROM t1 JOIN t3 USING (k)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt failed with `java.lang.AssertionError: RexInputRef index 2 out of range 0..1` somewhere in Calcite.\r\n\r\nJoinScanWithRefConverter does an extra step of mapping indices to column indices in the original WITH queries, which is not correct. In fact, the other converter responsible for JOINs, JoinScanConverter, has the correct implementation, and that works fine for JOINs that has reference to WITH queries. So here I delete the incorrect JoinScanWithRefConverter class and move to the other one.\r\n\r\nAlso added some tests to prevent regression.\r\n\r\nr: @apilloud @amaliujia \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

On Python 3, we use FastAvro module, which does not accept avro-python3 schema classes. This PR corrects this instruction. \r\n\r\nTo make Py2->3 transition easier for the users, we try to catch if users continue to feed avro-python3 schemas into Avro IO and error-out with a better message.\r\n\r\nAlso, fastavro does not require a parsed schema, since the schema is re-parsed anyway, see: [1], [2], it would be simpler to ask users to pass raw schema.\r\n\r\n[1]

existing ConfluentSchemaRegistryDeserializerProvider uses the writer schema to deserialize Avro records from Kafka, but passes a fixed schema to the AvroCoder. If the Kafka topic contains evolved schema, the AvroCoder will fail to encode the records. \r\n\r\nThis commit uses the deserialize(bytes, readerSchema) method from KafkaAvroDeserializer, in order to deserialize Kafak Avro records with a schema consistent with AvroCoder. \r\n\r\nThe change causes ConfluentSchemaRegistryDeserializerProviderTest to fail, due to an existing error. mockRegistryClient.register returns the schema id but not the schema version. With the changes in this commit, the mockRegistryClient will be called one more time, which in turns call mockRegistryClient.register(). This causes schema id and schema version to deviate. Therefore, the unit test is modified to correctly acquire the schema version. \r\n\r\nI have ran local test on the java sdk, and spotless test. The modified logic has been tested on an actual pipeline with Dataflow Runner, which successfully read from a topic with evolved schema.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
