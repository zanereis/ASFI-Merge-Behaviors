href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases\">com.google.guava:guava's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>33.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Request for Android users</h3>\n<p>If you know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least the previous release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to do so. Starting with that version, we are experimenting with including Java 8+ APIs in <code>guava-android</code>. Before we commit to adding such APIs, we want as much testing as we can get: If we later expose a set of Java 8+ APIs and then discover that they break users, we won't want to remove them, as the removal would break users, too.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-jre/guava-33.1.0-jre.jar\">33.1.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-android/guava-33.1.0-android.jar\">33.1.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/docs/\">33.1.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-jre vs. 33.0.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.0.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated our Error Prone dependency to 2.26.1, which includes a JPMS-ready jar of annotations. If you use the Error Prone annotations in a modular build of your own code, you may need to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">add a <code>requires</code> line for them</a>. (d48c6dfbb8, c6e91c498ced26631029d1bdfdb9154d4a217368)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added a <code>Duration</code> overload for <code>Suppliers.memoizeWithExpiration</code>. (76e46ec35b)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated the remaining two overloads of <code>Throwables.propagateIfPossible</code>. They won't be deleted, but we recommend migrating off them. (cf86414a87)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed a bug that could cause <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/pull/6851#issuecomment-1931276822\">false &quot;recursive load&quot; reports during refresh</a>. (0e1aebf73e)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the return types of <code>transitiveClosure()</code> and <code>reachableNodes()</code> to <code>Immutable*</code> types. <code>reachableNodes()</code> already returned an immutable object (even though that was not reflected in the declared return type); <code>transitiveClosure()</code> used to return a mutable object. The old signatures remain available, so this change does not break binary compatibility. (09e655f6c1)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the behavior of views returned by graph accessor methods that take a graph element as input: They now throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> when that element is removed from the graph. (8dca776341)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Optimized <code>Checksum</code>-based hash functions for Java 9+. (afb35a5d1b)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Exposed <code>FakeTicker</code> <code>Duration</code> methods to Android users. (f346bbb6a7)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the constructors of <code>UncheckedExecutionException</code> and <code>ExecutionError</code> that don't accept a cause. We won't remove these constructors, but we recommend migrating off them, as users of those classes often assume that instances will contain a cause. (1bb3c4386b)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Improved the correctness of racy accesses for J2ObjC users.

href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases\">com.google.guava:guava's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>33.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Request for Android users</h3>\n<p>If you know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least the previous release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to do so. Starting with that version, we are experimenting with including Java 8+ APIs in <code>guava-android</code>. Before we commit to adding such APIs, we want as much testing as we can get: If we later expose a set of Java 8+ APIs and then discover that they break users, we won't want to remove them, as the removal would break users, too.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-jre/guava-33.1.0-jre.jar\">33.1.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-android/guava-33.1.0-android.jar\">33.1.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/docs/\">33.1.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-jre vs. 33.0.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.0.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated our Error Prone dependency to 2.26.1, which includes a JPMS-ready jar of annotations. If you use the Error Prone annotations in a modular build of your own code, you may need to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">add a <code>requires</code> line for them</a>. (d48c6dfbb8, c6e91c498ced26631029d1bdfdb9154d4a217368)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added a <code>Duration</code> overload for <code>Suppliers.memoizeWithExpiration</code>. (76e46ec35b)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated the remaining two overloads of <code>Throwables.propagateIfPossible</code>. They won't be deleted, but we recommend migrating off them. (cf86414a87)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed a bug that could cause <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/pull/6851#issuecomment-1931276822\">false &quot;recursive load&quot; reports during refresh</a>. (0e1aebf73e)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the return types of <code>transitiveClosure()</code> and <code>reachableNodes()</code> to <code>Immutable*</code> types. <code>reachableNodes()</code> already returned an immutable object (even though that was not reflected in the declared return type); <code>transitiveClosure()</code> used to return a mutable object. The old signatures remain available, so this change does not break binary compatibility. (09e655f6c1)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the behavior of views returned by graph accessor methods that take a graph element as input: They now throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> when that element is removed from the graph. (8dca776341)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Optimized <code>Checksum</code>-based hash functions for Java 9+. (afb35a5d1b)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Exposed <code>FakeTicker</code> <code>Duration</code> methods to Android users. (f346bbb6a7)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the constructors of <code>UncheckedExecutionException</code> and <code>ExecutionError</code> that don't accept a cause. We won't remove these constructors, but we recommend migrating off them, as users of those classes often assume that instances will contain a cause. (1bb3c4386b)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Improved the correctness of racy accesses for J2ObjC users.

of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a

in <code>2.26.x</code>, the 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a

note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks. Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations <code>2.26.x</code> and newer may see errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\nimport com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                            ^\n  (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fix is to add <code>requires static</code> to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code> module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/b38057250a8a035d6b3856098145aeab1df1149f\"><code>b380572</code></a> Release Error Prone 2.26.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16\"><code>9d99ee7</code></a> fix: module name → <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code></li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.26.0&new-version=2.26.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a

in <code>2.26.x</code>, the 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a

note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks. Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations <code>2.26.x</code> and newer may see errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\nimport com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                            ^\n  (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fix is to add <code>requires static</code> to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code> module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/b38057250a8a035d6b3856098145aeab1df1149f\"><code>b380572</code></a> Release Error Prone 2.26.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16\"><code>9d99ee7</code></a> fix: module name → <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code></li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.26.0&new-version=2.26.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
