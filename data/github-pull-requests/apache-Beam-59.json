on external SchemaTransforms may lead to changes in how their configurations look (ie. adding and removing fields, changing the order of fields). In addition to that, currently most Java SchemaTransformProviders inherit from [TypedSchemaTransformProvider](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/transforms/TypedSchemaTransformProvider.java), which infers its configuration schema by using a configuration class and [AutoValueSchema](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/AutoValueSchema.java). While this approach is very convenient, the ordering of fields in the inferred schema is unfortunately not consistent. All of this is to say that the configuration schema of external transforms is prone to changes.\r\n\r\nWhen we use an external SchemaTransform in Python, we build a payload that includes the configuration fields. These are the same fields used to set up the external SchemaTransform. Currently, we only use the input kwargs to construct the payload, so we are blind to what the external configuration schema actually is. The changes in this PR make it so that we first fetch the external configuration schema then construct the payload in accordance to that schema.","created_at":"2023-04-04T13:02:00Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T16:29:45Z","closed_at":"2023-04-19T16:29:45Z","merged_at":"2023-04-19T16:29:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd8950176db0116221a1b739a3916da26d822f2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1738121359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM4MTIxMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/python","name":"python","color":"e2d35d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/26100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/26100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/26100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1174c228bc80fa049e84b5109776ad717010d342","head":{"label":"ahmedabu98:config_schema_field_order","ref":"config_schema_field_order","sha":"1174c228bc80fa049e84b5109776ad717010d342","user":{"login":"ahmedabu98","id":65791736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzkxNzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65791736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedabu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":447401958,"node_id":"R_kgDOGqrP5g","name":"beam","full_name":"ahmedabu98/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahmedabu98","id":65791736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzkxNzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65791736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedabu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedabu98/beam","description":"Apache

If the manifest of one contains a manifest with a class path attribute, the JVM will load those jars.

This is performed by a copy and then delete so it is not atomic. The Java implementation follows this approach.\r\n* Add support for Copy in Local FileSystem.\r\n* Add test coverage for the GCS FileSystem implementation. This adds a new test dependency to `github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server/fakestorage`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

retries for the portable artifact path, and corrects the error handling.\r\n\r\nPython artifact server is closing the stream `StageViaPortableApi Recv error: rpc error: code = Internal desc = stream terminated by RST_STREAM with error code: PROTOCOL_ERROR` which implies an implementation error on either the Python side, or the Go side of the divide, but most likely in the HTTP2 protocol handling, which is lower level than beam tends to go.\r\n\r\nThe Go half was following the sequence correctly, but wasn't logging server side close errors correctly. This PR surfaces allows those errors to be properly surfaced. It further adds retrying by restarting the reverse retrieval protocol. This should be sufficient to deflake the Go tests against the Portable Python runner, as the flake only happens rarely. But this isn't a for sure thing.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a test for the happy path on uploads. So retries aren't done, nor is the legacy backup path checked.\r\n\r\nCloses #26061 for now, but we can always re-open if the same flakes recur, along with the improved logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the boot loaders log to the logging service once we have an endpoint. This allows their severity to be recorded properly for better surfacing in runners, such as for fatal errors.\r\n\r\nSets the default log level to Debug for boot loader logging instead of Info, since boot loader configuration is unlikely to be of interest to most Beam users. Previously fatal logs use.\r\n\r\nAlso moves the \"provision\" code to a package path to indicate it's for Beam's container bootloader use, and not for Beam Go SDK users. It was never intended for end users, so this reduction in surface clarifies the intention among Go SDK packages.\r\n\r\nFixes #25314 and #24470 which were both around the incorrect surfacing of these errors as \"info\", and how they hampered debugging.\r\n\r\nThis also serves as a stopgap for issues in #25582 until that's resolved. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the metrics package's context work to extract the PTransformID of the logged message. This allows for attribution of logged messages to specific transforms for filtering and searching purposes.\r\n\r\nAlso adds message batching to reduce round trips to the logging service, but only up to a current cap of 64 messages at a time.\r\n\r\nTo avoid delays, fatal/critical logs are immediately flushed. However, if the logger is \"caught up\", then a batch is sent anyway.\r\n\r\nRefactored the log handler slightly to be easier to test, and added a unit test for batching and flushing cases.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26030\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

performance and polishes documentation. We decided to cut an early patch mainly to ensure python works properly.</p>\n<h2>Python repl hang</h2>\n<p>Despite trying many things prior to v1.0.0, a glitch escaped us. <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> tried the VMware Labs <a href=\"https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes/pkgs/container/python-wasm\">python-wasm</a>, and noticed a repl hang. Edo and <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> collaborated on a fix, which also ended up deleting tricky code. He verified python-wasm works, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> verified <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces/dcraw\">dcraw</a> still works as well. Thank these folks for the teamwork and rigor!</p>\n<h2>Optimizations</h2>\n<p>Due to the nature of our team, you can expect optimizations in every release. A lot of work by <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> has been optimization both from line count and performance. There were only several days duration since v1.0.0, the culmination of work by Takeshi and <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> (with review support by <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a>) resulted in less code and a slight bump in performance in an end user benchmark:</p>\n<pre><code>goos: darwin\ngoarch: arm64\npkg: github.com/dapr/components-contrib/bindings/wasm\n           │   old.txt   │           new.txt            │\n           │   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base         │\nExample-12   12.11µ ± 2%   12.02µ ± 1%  ~ (p=0.132 n=6)\n<p>pkg: github.com/dapr/components-contrib/middleware/http/wasm\n│   old.txt   │              new.txt              │\n│   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base              │\nNative/rewrite/rewrite-12   573.7n ± 0%   575.0n ± 0%       ~ (p=0.240 n=6)\nTinygo/rewrite/rewrite-12   1.161µ ± 1%   1.155µ ± 1%  -0.52% (p=0.026 n=6)\nWat/rewrite/rewrite-12      986.2n ± 0%   988.4n ± 1%       ~ (p=0.485 n=6)\ngeomean                     869.3n        869.0n       -0.03%\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p>Our documentation improved in the last few days as well: <a href=\"https://github.com/jcchavezs\"><code>@​jcchavezs</code></a> fixed some glitches on our home page around trying out wazero, <a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> added PDFium tools to our <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/users/\">users page</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt\"><code>@​codefromthecrypt</code></a> implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/Xe\"><code>@​Xe</code></a>'s suggestion to improve our <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tetratelabs/wazero#ModuleConfig\">our walltime clock</a> documentation. We really appreciate the pro-activity on user facing documentation!</p>\n<h2>v1.0.0</h2>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0 completes our six month pre-release period and begins our compatibility promise. We will use semantic versions to label releases, and not break APIs we've exposed as non-experimental.</p>\n<p>Those not familiar with wazero can check out <a href=\"https://tetrate.io/blog/introducing-wazero-from-tetrate/\">this blog</a> which overviews the zero dependency runtime. You can also check out <a href=\"https://wazero.io\">our website</a> especially the <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/\">community</a> and <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/users/\">users</a> pages.</p>\n<p>Many of you have been following along with our <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">pre-releases</a> over the last 6 months. We did introduce change since v1.0.0-rc.2 with a particularly notable feature we call &quot;anonymous modules&quot;. So, let's talk about that first.</p>\n<h2>Anonymous modules</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways wazero is used for high-volume request handling. One way is pooling modules and the other is instantiating per-request.</p>\n<p>The pool approach is used for functions designed to be invoked many times, such as <a href=\"https://http-wasm.io/\">http-wasm</a>'s handler functions. A host, such a <a href=\"https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-middleware/middleware-wasm/\">dapr</a> keeps a pool of modules, and checks one out per request.</p>\n<p>The re-instantiate approach is where you know you can't re-use a module, because the code is not safe to invoke more than once. For example, WASI commands are not safe to re-invoke. So, you have to instantiate a fresh module per request.

[com.avast.gradle:gradle-docker-compose-plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin) from 0.14.12 to 0.16.12.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/releases\">com.avast.gradle:gradle-docker-compose-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Gradle 8 compatibility</h2>\n<p>Usage of deprecated internal <code>VersionNumber</code> class removed <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/399\">#399</a></p>\n<h2>0.16.11</h2>\n<p>Project name lowercased <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/386\">#386</a></p>\n<h2>0.16.10</h2>\n<p>Performance optimization <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/382\">#382</a></p>\n<h2>0.16.9</h2>\n<p>The level of a log message changed from lifecycle to info.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null to fallback to Docker default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null or empty value to reset to default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>New Gradle Publish plugin used</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>MacOS-specific defaults for executable and dockerExecutable removed</h2>\n<p>The defaults used to be <code>/usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code> and <code>/usr/local/bin/docker</code>, now it is just plain <code>docker-compose</code> and <code>docker</code> (for all platforms).</p>\n<h2>isRequiredBy changed in order not to break configuration avoidance</h2>\n<p>This release changes the behavior of <code>isRequiredBy</code> so the <code>Up</code> tasks should be executed as the last dependency of the configured task. Till now, we have this optimization for <code>classes</code> tasks only.</p>\n<p>As reported in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/352\">#352</a></p>\n<h2>Custom project name propagated correctly</h2>\n<p><code>projectName</code> property wasn't properly used due to a bug introduced in <code>0.16.0</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem was that the property was declared as a plain <code>String</code> instead of <code>Provider&lt;String&gt;</code>, so a change to the original value wasn't propagated to <code>ComposeExecutor</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>dockerExecutor initialized before used</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114815875\">reported</a>, it could happen that <code>dockerExecutor</code> was used before it was initialized. This release fixes this potential issue.</p>\n<h2>Tasks registration fixed</h2>\n<p>It is possible to get <code>A dependency must not be empty</code> error with <code>0.16.0</code> version of the plugin. This release should solve this issue (reported <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114623955\">here</a>).</p>\n<h2>Gradle Configuration Cache support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/351\">#351</a></p>\n<h2>Dots in default project name replaced</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/347\">#347</a></p>\n<h2>Services with dashes supported correctly</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/345\">#345</a></p>\n<h2>Docker Compose V2 support</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

makes 3 changes:\r\n\r\n1) There was a correctness issue with the example and it would always predict `Background`. This is because `RunInference` returns an unbatched version of the result array in each `PredictionResult`, as compared to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub#run_it_on_a_single_image which returns result as an array with an extra batching dimension. The solution is to run `argmax` over the whole array instead of just the first element.\r\n2) Fixes the readme instructions to run it.\r\n3) Adds a newline between written out results. Otherwise, multiple results will render like `military generalbackgroundbackground` instead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmilitary general\r\nbackground\r\nbackground\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #25996\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.0.0-rc.1 to 1.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.0.0</h2>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0 completes our six month pre-release period and begins our compatibility promise. We will use semantic versions to label releases, and not break APIs we've exposed as non-experimental.</p>\n<p>Those not familiar with wazero can check out <a href=\"https://tetrate.io/blog/introducing-wazero-from-tetrate/\">this blog</a> which overviews the zero dependency runtime. You can also check out <a href=\"https://wazero.io\">our website</a> especially the <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/\">community</a> and <a href=\"https://wazero.io/community/users/\">users</a> pages.</p>\n<p>Many of you have been following along with our <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">pre-releases</a> over the last 6 months. We did introduce change since v1.0.0-rc.2 with a particularly notable feature we call &quot;anonymous modules&quot;. So, let's talk about that first.</p>\n<h2>Anonymous modules</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways wazero is used for high-volume request handling. One way is pooling modules and the other is instantiating per-request.</p>\n<p>The pool approach is used for functions designed to be invoked many times, such as <a href=\"https://http-wasm.io/\">http-wasm</a>'s handler functions. A host, such a <a href=\"https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-middleware/middleware-wasm/\">dapr</a> keeps a pool of modules, and checks one out per request.</p>\n<p>The re-instantiate approach is where you know you can't re-use a module, because the code is not safe to invoke more than once. For example, WASI commands are not safe to re-invoke. So, you have to instantiate a fresh module per request. You can also re-instantiate for higher security on otherwise safe functions.</p>\n<p>The latter case was expensive before, because we had to make sure each request had not just a new module, but also a unique name in the runtime. You would see things like this to do that.</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>// Currently, concurrent modules can conflict on name. Make sure we have\n// a unique one.\ninstanceNum := out.instanceCounter.Add(1)\ninstanceName := out.binaryName + &quot;-&quot; + strconv.FormatUint(instanceNum, 10)\nmoduleConfig := out.moduleConfig.WithName(instanceName)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both allocating a unique name and also name-based locks have a cost to them, and very high throughput use cases, such as event handling would show some contention around this.</p>\n<p>Through a lot of brainstorming and work, <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/ckaznocha\"><code>@​ckaznocha</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> found a clever way to improve performance. When a module has no name, it has nothing to export to other modules. Most of the lock tension was around things to export, and an unnamed module is basically a leaf node with no consumer except the host. We could avoid a lot of the more expensive locking by special-casing modules instantiated without a name.</p>\n<p>In the end, to improve re-instantiation performance (when you can't pool modules), clear your module name!</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code>-       // Currently, concurrent modules can conflict on name. Make sure we have\n-       // a unique one.\n-       instanceNum := out.instanceCounter.Add(1)\n-       instanceName := out.binaryName + &quot;-&quot; + strconv.FormatUint(instanceNum, 10)\n-       moduleConfig := out.moduleConfig.WithName(instanceName)\n+       // Clear the module name so that instantiations won't conflict.\n+       moduleConfig := out.moduleConfig.WithName(&quot;&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Other changes</h2>\n<p>There were a myriad of change from wazero regulars, all of them in the bucket of stabilization, bug fixes or efficiency in general. <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt\"><code>@​codefromthecrypt</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> put a lot of work into triage on WASI edge cases, both discussion and code. <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> fixed platform support for solaris/illumos <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> optimized wazero performance even more than before. <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> fixed a really important poll issue.</p>\n<p>These were driven by and thanks to community work.

receiving and directing timers to the *exec.DataSource from the DataManager.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't fully implement timers for #22737, and only comprises the required data plane changes. This unblocks their development however, though it includes an untested TimerWriter path, and unused callback invocations in the DataSource to support this later.\r\n\r\nThe FnAPI Data Stream multiplexes all data for all instructions onto a single channel from the Runner harness. Each message may contain Data or Timers bytes for one or more instructions executing on the SDK harness, to be decoded by the execution plane's DataSource. The Data or Timers are directed to a specfic PTransform.\r\n\r\nThe data and timers may arrive before or after the associated instruction begins execution. This means that the Data and Timers must be buffered in the SDK, until they are consumed, or their associated instruction is marked as ended.  Since a single instruction may have more than one consuming PTransform it's important to track the wanted number of \"islast\" signals, to compare against the number received, and only signal that all byte streams for this instruction are complete when they match.\r\n\r\nSpecific things to note: \r\n* In elementChan we use a mutex as well as the channel to avoid concurrent changes to the \"want\" and \"got\", but use an atomic to check if elementChan is closed. This is lighterweight than using the mutex to check the condition all the time.\r\n* The channel index in DataSource now defaults to 0 instead of -1, and we now do a \"post processing check\" to validate if a split has occurred. This ensures that the expected primary and residuals are respected in the same way they were before.\r\n\r\nUnit tests were updated to match the current possible cases, and validate the above mentioned semantics. A \"read\" benchmark was added as well. Additional larger scale testing was also done to ensure continued correctness of the data plane's behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso Closes #21164, ensuring that the last element is always consumed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

If you want to keep using an old checkpoint, please change your optimizer to <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code> (e.g. <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.Adam</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>TF1 compatibility.</strong> The new optimizer, <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code>, does not support TF1 any more, so please use the legacy optimizer <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code>. We highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate\">migrating your workflow to TF2</a> for stable support and new features.</li>\n<li><strong>Old optimizer API not found.</strong> The new optimizer, <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code>, has a different set of public APIs from the old optimizer. These API changes are mostly related to getting rid of slot variables and TF1 support. Please check the API documentation to find alternatives to the missing API. If you must call the deprecated API, please change your optimizer to the legacy optimizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Learning rate schedule access.</strong> When using a <code>tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule</code>, the new optimizer's <code>learning_rate</code> property returns the current learning rate value instead of a <code>LearningRateSchedule</code> object as before. If you need to access the <code>LearningRateSchedule</code> object, please use <code>optimizer._learning_rate</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>If you implemented a custom optimizer based on the old optimizer.</strong> Please set your optimizer to subclass <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code>. If you want to migrate to the new optimizer and find it does not support your optimizer, please file an issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues\">Keras GitHub repo</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Errors, such as <code>Cannot recognize variable...</code>.</strong> The new optimizer requires all optimizer variables to be created at the first <code>apply_gradients()</code> or <code>minimize()</code> call. If your workflow calls the optimizer to update different parts of the model in multiple stages, please call <code>optimizer.build(model.trainable_variables)</code> before the training loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Timeout or performance loss.</strong> We don't anticipate this to happen, but if you see such issues, please use the legacy optimizer, and file an issue in the Keras GitHub repo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The old Keras optimizer will never be deleted, but will not see any new feature additions. New optimizers (for example, <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Adafactor</code>) will only be implemented based on the new <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code> base class.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>tensorflow/python/keras</code> code is a legacy copy of Keras since the TensorFlow v2.7 release, and will be deleted in the v2.12 release.

Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, you will need to install TensorFlow in WSL2, or install tensorflow-cpu and, optionally, try the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security vulnerability fixes will no longer be patched to this Tensorflow version. The latest Tensorflow version includes the security vulnerability fixes. You can update to the latest version (recommended) or patch security vulnerabilities yourself <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#patching-guidelines\">steps</a>. You can refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases\">release notes</a> of the latest Tensorflow version for a list of newly fixed vulnerabilities. If you have any questions, please create a GitHub issue to let us know.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also introduces several vulnerability fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes an FPE in TFLite in conv kernel <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27579\">CVE-2023-27579</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a double free in Fractional(Max/Avg)Pool <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25801\">CVE-2023-25801</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a null dereference on ParallelConcat with XLA <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25676\">CVE-2023-25676</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a segfault in Bincount with XLA <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25675\">CVE-2023-25675</a></li>\n<li>Fixes an NPE in RandomShuffle with XLA enable <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25674\">CVE-2023-25674</a></li>\n<li>Fixes an FPE in TensorListSplit with XLA <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25673\">CVE-2023-25673</a></li>\n<li>Fixes segmentation fault in tfg-translate <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25671\">CVE-2023-25671</a></li>\n<li>Fixes an NPE in QuantizedMatMulWithBiasAndDequantize <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25670\">CVE-2023-25670</a></li>\n<li>Fixes an FPE in AvgPoolGrad with XLA <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25669\">CVE-2023-25669</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a heap out-of-buffer read vulnerability in the QuantizeAndDequantize operation <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25668\">CVE-2023-25668</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a segfault when opening multiframe gif <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25667\">CVE-2023-25667</a></li>\n<li>Fixes an NPE in SparseSparseMaximum <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25665\">CVE-2023-25665</a></li>\n<li>Fixes an FPE in AudioSpectrogram <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25666\">CVE-2023-25666</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a heap-buffer-overflow in AvgPoolGrad  <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25664\">CVE-2023-25664</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a NPE in TensorArrayConcatV2  <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25663\">CVE-2023-25663</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a Integer overflow in EditDistance  <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25662\">CVE-2023-25662</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a Seg fault in <code>tf.raw_ops.Print</code> <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25660\">CVE-2023-25660</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a OOB read in DynamicStitch <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25659\">CVE-2023-25659</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a OOB Read in GRUBlockCellGrad <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25658\">CVE-2023-25658</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Release 2.11.0</h1>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code> now points to the new Keras optimizer, and\nold optimizers have moved to the <code>tf.keras.optimizers.legacy</code> namespace.\nIf you find your workflow failing due to this change,\nyou may be facing one of the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Checkpoint loading failure.</strong> The new optimizer handles optimizer\nstate differently from the old optimizer, which simplies the logic of\ncheckpoint saving/loading, but at the cost of breaking checkpoint\nbackward compatibility in some cases. If you want to keep using an old\ncheckpoint, please change your optimizer to\n<code>tf.keras.optimizers.legacy.XXX</code> (e.g.\n<code>tf.keras.optimizers.legacy.Adam</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>TF1 compatibility.</strong> The new optimizer does not support TF1 any more,\nso please use the legacy optimizer <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code>.\nWe highly recommend to migrate your workflow to TF2 for stable\nsupport and new features.</li>\n<li><strong>API not found.</strong> The new optimizer has a different set of public APIs\nfrom the old optimizer. These API changes are mostly related to\ngetting rid of slot variables and TF1 support. Please check the API</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
