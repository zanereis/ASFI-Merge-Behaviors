href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.1\">Guava 30.1</a>'s warning log message for running <code>guava-android</code> under a Java 7 VM. (Android VMs are unaffected.) If the warning <em>itself</em> causes you trouble, you can eliminate it by silencing the logger for <code>com.google.common.base.Preconditions</code> (which is used <em>only</em> for this warning). This warning prepares for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5269\">removing support for Java 7 in 2021</a>. Please report any problems. We have tried to make the warning as safe as possible, but anytime a common library logs, especially as aggressively as we do in this new release, there is the potential for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/41017717/28465\"><code>NullPointerException</code></a> or even <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/48009613/28465\">deadlock</a>. (To be clear, Guava will not log under Java 8 or Android, but it will under Java 7.)
