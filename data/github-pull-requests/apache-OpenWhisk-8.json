At this point this POC enables support for executing NodeJS actions\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\n\r\nSome of the key aspects here are\r\n\r\n1. Supports most of OpenWhisk features\r\n2. Developers use std OpenWhisk tooling to create functions\r\n3. Invoker can delegate execution to Lambda based on some policy\r\n4. Execution via Lambda is an implementation detail not surfaced to end developers\r\n\r\nSome potential benefits of this are \r\n\r\n1. Tap into cloud provider platforms for scaling out\r\n2. Bring compute near to content\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\n### Custom Runtime\r\n\r\nA custom runtime is implemented based on [LambCI][4] project. The changes done can be seen [here][5]. It basically enabled invoking the runner.js (similar to one present in OpenWhisk nodejs runtime) from the bootstrap.js which in turn is the entrypoint.\r\n\r\n#### Lambda - Runtime Protocol\r\n\r\nLambda uses a [pull based protocol][6]. All calls are made to an endpoint passed via env `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API`\r\n\r\n##### Init\r\n\r\n1. As part of startup Lambda system would execute `bootstrap`\r\n2. `bootstrap` would load the function code. If it get any error then it makes a POST call to `/runtime/init/error`\r\n\r\n##### Execute\r\n\r\nOnce initialized the runtime would then constantly poll for invocations \r\n\r\n1. Make call to `/runtime/invocation/next`\r\n2. Process the invocation json payload\r\n    - If success submit the response to `/runtime/invocation/<AwsRequestId>/response`\r\n    - If error submit the error to `/runtime/invocation/<AwsRequestId>/error`        \r\n\r\nThis polling would continue until the process gets terminated\r\n\r\n#### Lambda OpenWhisk bridge\r\n\r\nCompared to Lambda OpenWhisk has a push based protocol described [here][7] where runtime would\r\n\r\n1. Start a server on port 8080\r\n2. Invoker would perform `/init`\r\n3. Invoker would execute by invoking the `/run` endpoint\r\n\r\nTo create a bridge the [custom runtime][5] for now mimics the flow which happens within `/run` call by invoking `runner.js` and takes care of init as part of Lambda runtime init lifecycle. Due to this mode the Lambda functions need to be created as part of creation itself and runtime cannot be seeded with function code at time of execution. (See Lambda Builder)\r\n\r\n#### Lambda OpenWhisk Generic Bridge :question:\r\n\r\nGoing forward we may implement some of action loop variant which implements the bridge part and instead of having a server interface just implements the poll loop and translate the call to OpenWhisk runtimes\r\n\r\n### Lambda Builder\r\n\r\nGiven the way Lambda functions work we need to create Lambda function at time of creation. To enable this a new `LambdaBuilder` service is implemented which (for now) listens to changes in `whisks` collection in CosmosDB via [changefeed][8] and upon any change it create/update/delete a Lambda function based on Action code.\r\n\r\nCurrently this service only does this transformation for those runtimes which are supported (like nodejs)\r\n\r\n### Lambda Container Factory\r\n\r\nFor actual execution a `LambdaContainerFactory` is implemented. Upon receiving any activation it checks if the backing action can be a Lambda then it routes the call to Lambda system otherwise it delegates the activation processing to system default implementation (like Docker/Mesos/K8s)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo try out the POC following steps would be required\r\n\r\n### 1. Deploy the custom runtime layer\r\n\r\nYou need to have [aws cli][11] installed with required credentials configured.\r\n\r\n1. Checkout the [branch][9]\r\n2. Execute `make build` via [Makefile][10]. This would generate a `layer.zip` in that directory\r\n3. Publish the layer via `make publish`\r\n\r\nYou should then get a ARN for the layer object which would be of format like `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:xxx:layer:customnodejs10:1`. Here `customnodejs10` is the layer name\r\n\r\n### 2. Deploy the Lambda Builder\r\n\r\nFor this you need a CosmosDB based deployed. The service need to have access to manage Lambda functions\r\n\r\n### 3. Configure the container factory\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  spi {\r\n    ContainerFactoryProvider = org.apache.openwhisk.core.containerpool.lambda.LambdaContainerFactoryProvider\r\n  }\r\n  aws {\r\n    lambda {\r\n      secondary-factory-provider = org.apache.openwhisk.core.mesos.MesosContainerFactoryProvider\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  aws {\r\n    lambda {\r\n      layer-mappings {\r\n        \"nodejs:10\" : \"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:xxx:layer:customnodejs10:1\"\r\n      }\r\n      account-id = \"xxx\"\r\n      common-role-name = \"arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/owl-generic-role\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we define\r\n\r\n1. Mapping between OpenWhisk `kind` and Lambda custom layer ARN\r\n2. An AWS Role which allows the Lambda function to write to CloudWatch logs\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nFor now this is meant to be a POC to see how far one can go with such a model. In future some parts to be implemented\r\n\r\n0. Complete the lots of TODO left in current imple\r\n1. Integrate with CloudWatch to enable pulling the logs\r\n2. Generic action loop like implementation to support any supported OpenWhisk runtime\r\n3. Optimize the processing flow - Say by doing invocation from Controller itself\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html\r\n[2]:

-->\r\nSuffix `count` has been used in OpenWhisk code for recording metrics - gauges and histogram which as per definition of graphite data source corresponds to the max value by aggregation. This has been reporting incorrect information. The recommendation is to use any other suffix other than `count`, `max` and `min`, if actual count at given time is the expected output hence changing it in logging logic to `counter`.\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n- The data being represented for eg in - Grafana would be reported correctly.

to ssl endpoint for alpine package downloads\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAlpine use http endpoint (http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz) for downloading the index files. \r\n\r\nPer [discussion at gliderlabs/docker-alpine#184](https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/184#issuecomment-250831640) there is a suggestion to use https://alpine.global.ssl.fastly.net/alpine/\r\n\r\nPer comment on [alpine forum](https://bugs.alpinelinux.org/issues/8087#note-3) use of http seems to be safe\r\n\r\n> apk checks downloaded packages using repository public keys, so it shouldn't really matter much. If you insist on using HTTPS, you could use a mirror supporting it directly, without using the Fastly CDN. All this considered, using HTTP for this will have no impact on security. It will only avoid the cost of encryption introduced by SSL.\r\n\r\nHowever some of our build system restrict access to non secure endpoints so we need to use a secure download url for alpine. So using the fastly url directly should be ok\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

support for reading attachment content from CloudFront which fronts the S3 bucket. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor Multi Region deployments (#4277) we plan to make use of CloudFront CDN which fronts the S3 bucket used to store attachments. It makes use of [CloudFront support for serving private content][1]\r\n\r\nThis feature is optional. By default `S3AttachmentStore` would perform read and writes from S3 directly. However once CloudFront configuration is provided then the reads would be performed from CloudFront while reads and deletes would be done at S3 level\r\n\r\n### Caching\r\nBy default CloudFront would keep the [cached copy for 24 hours][4]\r\n\r\n> By default, each file automatically expires after 24 hours\r\n\r\nAs the attachment objects stored in S3 are immutable by design we now set the `Cache-Control` header (as part of S3 object metadata) to a long duration (1 year) such that those objects are cached at edge location for long time\r\n\r\n### Usage \r\n\r\nConfigure OpenWhisk S3 support with CloudFront config `cloud-front-config`\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  s3 {\r\n    bucket = \"openwhisk-test\"\r\n    prefix = \"dev\"\r\n    cloud-front-config {\r\n      domain-name = \"foo.com\"\r\n      key-pair-id = \"OPENWHISKISFUNTOUSE\"\r\n      private-key = \"\"\"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nMIIBPAIBAAJBAOY+Q7vyH1SnCUoFIpzqmZe1TNCxiE6zuiMRmjuJqiAzQWdb5hEA\r\nZaC+f7Lcu53IvczZR0KsP4JndzG23rVg/y0CAwEAAQJBAMK+F3x4ppdrUSgSf9xJ\r\ncfAnoPlDsA8hZWcUFGgXYJYqKYw3NqoYG5fwyZ7xrwdMhpbdgD++nsBC/JMwUhEB\r\nh+ECIQDzj5Tbd7WvfaKGjozwQgHA9u3f53kxCWovpFEngU6VNwIhAPIAkAPnzuDr\r\nq3cEyAbM49ozjyc6/NOV6QK65HQj1gC7AiBrax/Ty3At/dL4VVaDgBkV6dHvtj8V\r\nCXnzmRzRt43Y8QIhAIzrvPE5RGP/eEqHUz96glhm276Zf+5qBlTbpfrnf0/PAiEA\r\nr1vFsvC8+KSHv7XGU1xfeiHHpHxEfDvJlX7/CxeWumQ=\r\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n\"\"\"\r\n      timeout = 10 m\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n Here you need to provide the\r\n\r\n1. `domain-name` - Like _xxx.cloudfront.net_. This would be determined based on the CloudFront distribution configured\r\n2. `key-pair-id` - ID of the private key used to perform url signing. See [here][3] for steps\r\n3. `private-key` - Content of RSA private key in `pem` format. You can also pass the key via an env variable\r\n4. `timeout` - Timeout for generated signed url. This ened not be very high as generated url is consumed immediately to read the content\r\n\r\nRefer to [AWS Docs][2] for more details. Further for CloudFront to access S3 bucket you need to [configure bucket with required policy][5]\r\n\r\nInternally the `CloudFrontSigner` would generate a url like\r\n\r\n`https://xxx.cloudfront.net/<object key>?Expires=xxx&Signature=xxx&Key-Pair-Id=xxx`\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n\r\n- `object key` - Path of attachment object in S3 bucket\r\n- `Key-Pair-Id` - The configure key pair id. It lets CloudFront to match and validate the signature \r\n\r\n### Test Runs\r\n\r\nThere is a `S3AttachmentStoreCloudFrontTests` test which run the integration test when CloudFront releated configuration is provided. It needs following env variables defined to run. See details above for what values need to provided for them.\r\n\r\n- `CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN_NAME`\r\n- `CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PAIR_ID`\r\n- `CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4277)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nThere is currently an issue with `SplunkLogStore` that assumes that all JSON objects received from Splunk API should always contain these fields: `log_timestamp`, `log_stream` and `log_message`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when trying to get the logs using: \r\n```\r\nwsk activation logs $activation_id\r\n```\r\nas Splunk sometimes sends empty JSON objects. \r\n\r\nThis PR handles the `NoSuchElementException`, displays an error message and allows the retrieval of all the other log messages for that particular activation. \r\n\r\nMore

PR enables soft delete of documents in CosmosDB. This is required for #4277\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nBy default the documents in CosmosDB are deleted directly. This PR exposes a config option `soft-delete-ttl` which once enabled for a collection would enable the soft delete mode. In this mode instead of actually deleting the document `CosmosDBArtifactStore` would \r\n\r\n1. Set a `_deleted` property to `true`\r\n2. Configure a TTL with value as specified in `soft-delete-ttl`\r\n\r\nThis ensures that document gets deleted at some later time. This would allow a service like cache invalidator to  pickup up deleted document in change feed.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this feature needs to ensure following invariants\r\n\r\n1. A soft deleted document cannot be read again using `get` call\r\n2. A `put` for soft deleted document should work without conflict\r\n3. Query results should ignore such soft deleted documents\r\n\r\n## Usage \r\n\r\nConfigure `soft-delete-ttl` \r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  cosmosdb {\r\n    WhiskEntity {\r\n      soft-delete-ttl = 10 h\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4277)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR allows SSL certificates for the openwhisk nginx to be copied from an arbitrary path, and provides overrides for the certificate names. I believe these were intended by past changes there were some gaps. For example, the `ssl.path` value was not properly used in the nginx script and the files had to be copied into the ansible directory. Also the certificate names could not be easily overriden (one would have to specify a full json value).\r\n\r\nAs part of, I removed an unused exposed port, and redirected http to https as well.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nInvoker use of cluster managed resources should allow dynamic cluster resizing.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nCurrently, invoker has a static config `whisk.container-pool.user-memory` that affects:\r\n* controller sharding across invokers\r\n* invoker's concept of ability to launch containers\r\n\r\nThis does not work well in an environment that may scale up in hosts to accommodate the ability to launch more containers. Making that config \"dynamic\" is also not the best solution since the invoker really has no say in ability to launch a container (in this case of cluster managed action containers, at least), and therefore relying on it at either controller or invoker layer is problematic.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces:\r\n* config flag to enable cluster managed resources - this is separate from ContainerFactory, and introduces some addition logic to ContainerPool\r\n* NodeStats - collected at ContainerPool from akka system event stream, and used to determine (which respect to latest snapshot of data) whether a container is launchable\r\n* Reservations - tracked at ContainerPool to accommodate timing delays between cluster manager container starts/stops, and updates to NodeStats\r\n\r\nSee proposal on apache wiki here: \r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENWHISK/Cluster+Manager+Resources+in+Invoker  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

[Kamon Datadog](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-datadog) dependencies to common so that Kamon Datadog reporter can be configured for setups using Datadog\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nSo far we only include Kamon Statsd reporter. This PR also adds the Kamon Datadog reporter such that it can be configured (if required) on setups which use Datadog for monitoring\r\n\r\nIt pulls in 1 more jars\r\n\r\n```\r\n|    +--- io.kamon:kamon-datadog_2.12:1.0.0\r\n|    |    +--- org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.12.1 -> 2.12.7\r\n|    |    +--- io.kamon:kamon-core_2.12:1.1.2 -> 1.1.3 (*)\r\n|    |    +--- com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.10.0 (*)\r\n|    |    \\--- org.scala-lang.modules:scala-java8-compat_2.12:0.8.0 (*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far we were maintaining separate repos internally which extend the docker images to include the datadog dependencies. Now with support for some new services (like cache invalidation #4314 ) such an approach increases work.\r\n\r\nIncluding this dependency directly should not have any adverse impact and also does not pull in many new jars.\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThe owperf tool benchmarks an OpenWhisk deployment for (warm) latency and throughput, with multiple capabilities:\r\n1. Measure performance of rules (trigger-to-action), sync and async actions\r\n1. Deeper profiling without instrumentation (e.g., Kamino) by leveraging the activation records in addition to the client's timing data. This avoids special setups, and can help gain performance insights on third-party deployments of OpenWhisk. \r\n1. New tunables that can affect performance: \r\n   1. Parameter size - controls the size of the parameter passed to the action or event\r\n   1. Actions per iteration (a.k.a. _ratio_) - controls how many rules are associated with a trigger [for rules] or how many actions are asynchronously invoked (burst size) at each iteration of a test worker [for actions].\r\n1. \"Master apart\" mode - Allow the master client to perform latency measurements while the worker clients stress OpenWhisk using a specific invocation pattern in the background. Useful for measuring latency under load, and for comparing latencies of rules and actions under load.\r\nThe tool is written in node.js, using mainly the modules of OpenWhisk client, cluster for concurrency, and commander for CLI procssing. All the tool files are in a single folder tools/owperf.\r\nHighly-detailed documentation of the tool is available in the folder's README.md\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4319 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

there is an deployment with several controllers, the test `Whisk rules should preserve rule status when a rule is updated` fails intermittently. The reason is, that there are several modifications on the rule. These modifications are already retried. But enabling and disabling the rule also modifies the database document. But that change is currently not retried.\nThis PR puts the enabling/disabling of the rule into the retry block as well to make this test more stable against our eventual consistency.\n\nCo-authored-by: Somaya Jamil <jamilsom@de.ibm.com>\n\n## Related issue and scope\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\n\n## My changes affect the following components\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\n- [ ] API\n- [ ] Controller\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\n- [ ] Invoker\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\n- [x] Tests\n- [ ] Deployment\n- [ ] CLI\n- [ ] General tooling\n- [ ] Documentation\n\n## Types of changes\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR implements a new service for performing Cache Invalidation when running with CosmosDB. See #4277 for details\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nTo propagate changes across cluster this PR implements a new service which makes use of the [changefeedprocessor](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-changefeedprocessor-java) library to listen to changes happening in `whisks` and `subject` collection and then convert them into Kafka message events which can be sent to `cacheInvalidation`.\r\n\r\nSo each cluster would have its own cache invalidation service running which would ensure that changes done by other clusters are picked up and routed to local cluster `cacheInvalidation` topic\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4277)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

storing the clusterId information as part of document json in db.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor Multi Region deployments (#4277) we need to differentiate which cluster made change to a document

This PR enables storing a `_clusterId` attribute which can be configured to uniquely identify current cluster. \r\n\r\nLater this attribute can be used by the cache invalidation service to filter out changes which are done by same cluster and only convert those changes from other cluster to local cache invalidation kafka topic\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4277 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR builds up on #4039 to allow passing config string as part of ansible deployment step\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPR #4039 enabled support for passing config string encoded as base64 via `OPENWHISK_ENCODED_CONFIG` env variable. This PR extends that and adds base empty templates which can be modified to pass in such config in ansible deployments. Currently the config templates are empty and we can decide later to port existing or newer config via this mechanism\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR adds an MBean which enables dumping the typesafe config including details from where config is getting picked up. This is useful to troubleshoot config issues and confirm if the intended config is being picked up properly.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR registers an MBean which enables fetching typesafe config at specific path like `whisk.kafka`. It acceps a second boolean param which enables dumping of location information from where config value was picked up\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait ConfigMXBean {\r\n  def getConfig(path: String, originComment: Boolean): String\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe MBean is registered with name `org.apache.openwhisk:name=config`\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker exec -it xxx bash # Open bash shell to controller docker container\r\n# cd $HOME\r\n# wget https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/cyclopsgroup/jmxterm/1.0.0/jmxterm-1.0.0-uber.jar\r\n# java -jar jmxterm-1.0.0-uber.jar\r\n# open 1\r\n# run -b org.apache.openwhisk:name=config getConfig whisk.spi true\r\n#calling operation getConfig of mbean org.apache.openwhisk:name=config with params [whisk.spi, true]\r\n#operation returns:\r\n    # reference.conf @ jar:file:/controller/lib/openwhisk-common-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar!/reference.conf: 8\r\nActivationStoreProvider=\"org.apache.openwhisk.core.database.ArtifactActivationStoreProvider\"\r\n...\r\nLoadBalancerProvider=\"org.apache.openwhisk.core.loadBalancer.ShardingContainerPoolBalancer\"\r\n    # system properties\r\nLogStoreProvider=\"org.apache.openwhisk.core.containerpool.logging.DockerToActivationLogStoreProvider\"\r\n    # reference.conf @ jar:file:/controller/lib/openwhisk-common-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar!/reference.conf: 9\r\nMessagingProvider=\"org.apache.openwhisk.connector.kafka.KafkaMessagingProvider\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo one can see that LogStoreProvider is set via system property\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
