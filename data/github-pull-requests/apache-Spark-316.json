What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`mcfork` in R looks opening a pipe ahead but the existing logic does not properly close it when it is executed hot. This leads to the failure of more forking due to the limit for number of files open.\r\n\r\nThis hot execution looks particularly for `gapply`/`gapplyCollect`. For unknown reason, this happens more easily in CentOS and could be reproduced in Mac too.\r\n\r\nAll the details are described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21093\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes simply to terminate R's worker processes in the parent of R's daemon to prevent a leak.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran the codes below on both CentOS and Mac with that configuration disabled/enabled.\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(list(list(1L, 1, \"1\", 0.1)), c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"))\r\ncollect(gapply(df, \"a\", function(key, x) { x }, schema(df)))\r\ncollect(gapply(df, \"a\", function(key, x) { x }, schema(df)))\r\n...  # 30 times\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, now it passes R tests on CentOS as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSparkSQL functions: Spark package found in SPARK_HOME: .../spark\r\n..............................................................................................................................................................\r\n..............................................................................................................................................................\r\n..............................................................................................................................................................\r\n..............................................................................................................................................................\r\n..............................................................................................................................................................\r\n....................................................................................................................................\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-16T02:45:59Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:06Z","closed_at":"2017-06-25T18:09:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"176189bdad88fabaee5cb2e2220767ef3791bd50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5fe3478298d992a7e91515651179d10563af445","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-21093","ref":"SPARK-21093","sha":"c5fe3478298d992a7e91515651179d10563af445","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

some of our big jobs, we see that around 30% of the time is being spent in reading the spill files from disk. In order to amortize the disk IO cost, the idea is to implement a read ahead input stream which asynchronously reads ahead from the underlying input stream when specified amount of data has been read from the current buffer. It does it by maintaining two buffer - active buffer and read ahead buffer. The active buffer contains data which should be returned when a read() call is issued. The read-ahead buffer is used to asynchronously read from the underlying input stream and once the active buffer is exhausted, we flip the two buffers so that we can start reading from the read ahead buffer without being blocked in disk I/O.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by running a job on the cluster and could see up to 8% CPU improvement.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change pulls the `LogisticAggregator` class out of LogisticRegression.scala and makes it extend `DifferentiableLossAggregator`. It also changes logistic regression to use the generic `RDDLossFunction` instead of having its own. \r\n\r\nOther minor changes:\r\n* L2Regularization accepts `Option[Int => Double]` for features standard deviation\r\n* L2Regularization uses `Vector` type instead of Array\r\n* Some tests added to LeastSquaresAggregator\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test suites are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt is really painful to not have configs in logical plan and expressions. We had to add all sorts of hacks (e.g. pass SQLConf explicitly in functions). This patch exposes SQLConf in logical plan, using a thread local variable and a getter closure that's set once there is an active SparkSession.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is a bit of a hack, since we didn't anticipate this need in the beginning (config was only exposed in physical plan). The implementation is described in `SQLConf.get`.\r\n\r\nIn terms of future work, we should follow up to clean up CBO (remove the need for passing in config).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated relevant tests for constraint propagation.","created_at":"2017-06-14T07:24:36Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T00:16:37Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T05:14:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a550ed96fbc8e925254a2bb6c66b490451d95745","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18299/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18299/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18299/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cec78b5cf1ced8322c8cd8e599a3197c50ed49c0","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-21092","ref":"SPARK-21092","sha":"cec78b5cf1ced8322c8cd8e599a3197c50ed49c0","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

wrong when the input is BigDecimal between -1.0 and 1.0. \r\n\r\nThe BigDecimal's precision is the digit count starts from the leftmost nonzero digit based on the [JAVA's BigDecimal definition](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1.In `acquireStorageMemory`, when the Memory Mode is OFF_HEAP ,the `maxOffHeapMemory` should be modified to `maxOffHeapStorageMemory`. after this PR,it will same as ON_HEAP Memory Mode.\r\nBecause when acquire memory is between `maxOffHeapStorageMemory` and `maxOffHeapMemory`,it will fail surely, so if acquire memory is greater than  `maxOffHeapStorageMemory`(not greater than `maxOffHeapMemory`),we should fail fast.\r\n2. Borrow memory from execution, `numBytes` modified to `numBytes - storagePool.memoryFree` will be more reasonable.\r\nBecause we just acquire `(numBytes - storagePool.memoryFree)`, unnecessary borrowed `numBytes` from execution\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadded unit test

change exposes the internal code path in SparkConf that allows\r\nconfigs to be read with variable substitution applied, and uses that\r\nnew method in SSLOptions so that SSL configs can reference other\r\nvariables, and more importantly, environment variables, providing\r\na secure way to provide passwords to Spark when using SSL.\r\n\r\nThe approach is a little bit hacky, but is the smallest change possible.\r\nOtherwise, the concept of \"namespaced configs\" would have to be added\r\nto the config system, which would create a lot of noise for not much\r\ngain at this point.\r\n\r\nTested with added unit tests, and on a real cluster with SSL enabled.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-13T21:23:41Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T01:04:58Z","closed_at":"2017-06-22T21:51:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1980d1593e37601e6cbb70d6904272737486b02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc94c4b9915bb9bef24a0200f5e2475221bbf656","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20379","ref":"SPARK-20379","sha":"dc94c4b9915bb9bef24a0200f5e2475221bbf656","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn standalone mode, if we enable external shuffle service by setting `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` to true, and then we try to start multiple workers on one host(by setting `SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=3` in spark-env.sh, and then run `sbin/start-slaves.sh`), we can only launch one worker on each host successfully and the rest of the workers fail to launch.\r\nThe reason is the port of external shuffle service if configed by `spark.shuffle.service.port`, so currently we could start no more than one external shuffle service on each host. In our case, each worker tries to start a external shuffle service, and only one of them succeeded doing this.\r\n\r\nWe should give explicit reason of failure instead of fail silently.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test by the following steps:\r\n1. SET `SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=1` in `conf/spark-env.sh`;\r\n2. SET `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` to `true` in `conf/spark-defaults.conf`;\r\n3. Run `sbin/start-all.sh`.\r\n\r\nBefore the change, you will see no error in the command line, as the following:\r\n```\r\nstarting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging to /Users/xxx/workspace/spark/logs/spark-xxx-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-xxx.local.out\r\nlocalhost: starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to /Users/xxx/workspace/spark/logs/spark-xxx-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-1-xxx.local.out\r\nlocalhost: starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to

/Users/xxx/workspace/spark/logs/spark-xxx-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-3-xxx.local.out\r\n```\r\nAnd you can see in the webUI that only one worker is running.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, you get explicit error messages in the command line:\r\n```\r\nstarting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis brings in fixes and upgrades from the [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) module. Notable fixes:\r\n\r\n* Import submodules accessed by pickled functions (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/80)\r\n* Support recursive functions inside closures (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/89, https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/90)\r\n* Fix ResourceWarnings and DeprecationWarnings (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/88)\r\n* Assume modules with `__file__` attribute are not dynamic (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/85)\r\n* Make cloudpickle Python 3.6 compatible (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/72)\r\n* Allow pickling of builtin methods (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/57)\r\n* Add ability to pickle dynamically created modules (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/52)\r\n* Support method descriptor (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/46)\r\n* No more pickling of closed files, was broken on Python 3 (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/32)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe [test suite for cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/tree/master/tests) tests the internal implementation. There are integration tests here in PySpark that use the `CloudPickleSerializer`.","created_at":"2017-06-12T22:34:42Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T19:43:00Z","closed_at":"2017-06-26T19:43:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d0d019ba0909f8b67f863ecea9891f199d46919","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b84222b6ea660ce5ec1aedfee50e297b436eb824","head":{"label":"rgbkrk:cloudpickle-upgrades","ref":"cloudpickle-upgrades","sha":"b84222b6ea660ce5ec1aedfee50e297b436eb824","user":{"login":"rgbkrk","id":836375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjM3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/836375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk","html_url":"https://github.com/rgbkrk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88533102,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODUzMzEwMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"rgbkrk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rgbkrk","id":836375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjM3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/836375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk","html_url":"https://github.com/rgbkrk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgbkrk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rgbkrk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `InMemoryFileIndex.listLeafFiles` behaviour to launch at most one spark job to list leaf files.\r\n\r\n##JIRA \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21056\r\n\r\nGiven partitioned file relation (e.g. parquet):\r\n```root/a=../b=../c=..```\r\nInMemoryFileIndex.listLeafFiles runs numberOfPartitions(a) times numberOfPartitions(b) spark jobs sequentially to list leaf files, if both numberOfPartitions(a) and numberOfPartitions(b) are below `spark.sql.sources.parallelPartitionDiscovery.threshold` and numberOfPartitions(c) is above `spark.sql.sources.parallelPartitionDiscovery.threshold`\r\n\r\nSince the jobs are run sequentially, the overhead of the jobs dominates and the file listing operation can become significantly slower than listing the files from the driver.\r\nI propose that InMemoryFileIndex.listLeafFiles should launch at most one spark job for listing leaf files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove all existing tests to non-installed directory so that it will never run by installing SparkR package\r\n\r\nFor a follow-up PR:\r\n- remove all skip_on_cran() calls in tests\r\n- clean up test timer\r\n- improve or change basic tests that do run on CRAN (if anyone has suggestion)\r\n\r\nIt looks like `R CMD build pkg` will still put pkg\\tests (ie. the full tests) into the source package but `R CMD INSTALL` on such source package does not install these tests (and so `R CMD check` does not run them)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- [x] unit tests, Jenkins\r\n- [x] AppVeyor\r\n- [x] make a source package, install it, `R CMD check` it - verify the full tests are not installed or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds the average hash map probe metrics to hash aggregate.\r\n\r\n`BytesToBytesMap` already has API to get the metrics, this PR adds an API to `UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMap` to access it.\r\n\r\nPreparing a test for this metrics seems tricky, because we don't know what collision keys are. For now, the test case generates random data large enough to have desired probe.\r\n\r\nTODO in later PR: add hash map metrics to join.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Java, instance fields are guaranteed to be first initialized to their corresponding default values (zero values) before the constructor is invoked. Thus, explicitly code to initialize fields to their zero values is redundant and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt's usually harmless to have such code in hand-written constructors, but in the case of mechanically generating code, such code could contribute to a significant portion of the code size and cause issues.\r\n\r\nThis ticket is a step in reducing the likelihood of hitting the 64KB bytecode method size limit in the Java Class files. This PR uses simple heuristics to filter out redundant code of initializing mutable state to their default (zero) values in `CodegenContext.addMutableState`, by matching string patterns. Basically, if the `initCode` in the added mutable state is like:\r\n```\r\n[this.]${variableName} = ${defaultValue};\r\n```\r\n(where `[this.]` indicates it's optional)\r\nThen it'll be replaced by an empty string instead.\r\n\r\nThis pattern will catch the most common cases. An example of drawn from production is:\r\n```\r\n/* 262651 */     value24709 = -1L;\r\n/* 262652 */     isNull24710 = false;\r\n/* 262653 */     value24710 = -1L;\r\n/* 262654 */     isNull24718 = false;\r\n/* 262655 */     value24718 = false;\r\n/* 262656 */     isNull24719 = false;\r\n/* 262657 */     value24719 = -1L;\r\n/* 262658 */     isNull24720 = false;\r\n/* 262659 */     value24720 = -1L;\r\n/* 262660 */     isNull24728 = false;\r\n/* 262661 */     value24728 = false;\r\n/* 262662 */     isNull24729 = false;\r\n/* 262663 */     value24729 = -1L;\r\n/* 262664 */     isNull24730 = false;\r\n/* 262665 */     value24730 = -1L;\r\n/* 262666 */     isNull24738 = false;\r\n...\r\n```\r\nwhere all of the `isNullNNN = false;` initialization code is redundant.\r\n\r\nAlternatives are:\r\n* Manually go through all the places where redundant initialization code is specified in `addMutableState()` call sites, and change them to empty string. That's tedious and involves changing a lot of code. But if we do it this way, we could considering giving `initCode` an default value of `\"\"` in the declaration of `addMutableState()`, which could be a nice improvement too.\r\n* Instead of using a simple regular-expression-based heuristic, use an actual parse tree to verify the redundant code pattern. That would make it very precise and be able to catch all cases, but it'll involve a bigger change, potentially changing a bit of infrastructure in the codegen, e.g. codegen with parse tree (AST) rather than strings. I'd like to take baby steps first and move to more heavyweight options later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan SQL and Catalyst unit tests. Also added some unit tests for the new filtering

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR the single queue of the LiveListenerBus was replaced by multiple independent queues.\r\n - The EventLoggingListener was put in an independent queue (it was the most time consuming listener).\r\n - The executorAllocationManager was put in an independent qeue (it is very impacted by event drop of the main queue due to other listener impacts, so isolation purpose)\r\n - The UI listeners were put in the same independent queue (One of them was very time consuming, we want no impact of the GUI on the other listener)\r\n - The \"extralisteners\" were put in the same independent queue, for isolation purpose\r\n - The streamingListenerBus was put in an independent queue. this llistener is a bus too, and the processing time of its listeners can be quite significant\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queue and its processing thread have been extracted from `LiveListenerBus` into a class `BusQueue`. The definition of most of the methods of `ListenerBus` has been extracted into a trait `WithListenerBus`. The `LiveListenerBus` implements it directly. It hold  the \"default\" queue associated with a group of listeners and a list of queues. The method `addListener`  of the `WithListenerBus` has a new optional boolean parameter (default value false) to require a independent queue for this listener instead of the default one. This parameter is ignored in the default implementation (in`ListenerBus`) . \r\nA listener which is also a set of listeners has been added. It allows to keep the current behavior for a group of dependent listeners or the default queue. It handles the per listener metrics.\r\nThe methods `addProcessor` and `removeProcessor` have been added to `LiveListenerBus` to be able to add message processing at the super type `SparkListenerEvent` in addition to the per event type processing of the listener interface. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nutest + manual tests on the

PR contains a tiny change to fix the way Spark parses string literals into timestamps. Currently, some timestamps that contain nanoseconds are corrupted during the conversion from internal UTF8Strings into the internal representation of timestamps.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT cast('2015-01-02 00:00:00.000000001' as TIMESTAMP)\").show(false)\r\n+------------------------------------------------+\r\n|CAST(2015-01-02 00:00:00.000000001 AS TIMESTAMP)|\r\n+------------------------------------------------+\r\n|2015-01-02 00:00:00.000001                      |\r\n+------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix was tested with existing tests. Also, there is a new test to cover cases that did not work previously.","created_at":"2017-06-09T11:59:23Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T20:09:49Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T20:09:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a28547b6d7845da6f8e1b7390a2d97eaaa910aa5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a498f83cda31c9d708b939197e9ad149bce80bb4","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-17914","ref":"spark-17914","sha":"a498f83cda31c9d708b939197e9ad149bce80bb4","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `UnsafeInMemorySorter`, one record may take 32 bytes: 1 `long` for pointer, 1 `long` for key-prefix, and another 2 `long`s as the temporary buffer for radix sort.\r\n\r\nIn `UnsafeExternalSorter`, we set the `DEFAULT_NUM_ELEMENTS_FOR_SPILL_THRESHOLD` to be `1024 * 1024 * 1024 / 2`, and hoping the max size of point array to be 8 GB. However this is wrong, `1024 * 1024 * 1024 / 2 * 32` is actually 16 GB, and if we grow the point array before reach this limitation, we may hit the max-page-size error.\r\n\r\nUsers may see exception like this on large dataset:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot allocate a page with more than 17179869176 bytes\r\nat org.apache.spark.memory.TaskMemoryManager.allocatePage(TaskMemoryManager.java:241)\r\nat org.apache.spark.memory.MemoryConsumer.allocatePage(MemoryConsumer.java:121)\r\nat org.apache.spark.util.collection.unsafe.sort.UnsafeExternalSorter.acquireNewPageIfNecessary(UnsafeExternalSorter.java:374)\r\nat org.apache.spark.util.collection.unsafe.sort.UnsafeExternalSorter.insertRecord(UnsafeExternalSorter.java:396)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.UnsafeExternalRowSorter.insertRow(UnsafeExternalRowSorter.java:94)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting `DEFAULT_NUM_ELEMENTS_FOR_SPILL_THRESHOLD` to a smaller number is not enough, users can still set the config to a big number and trigger the too large page size issue. This PR fixes it by explicitly handling the too large page size exception in the sorter and spill.\r\n\r\nThis PR also change the type of `spark.shuffle.spill.numElementsForceSpillThreshold` to int, because it's only compared with `numRecords`, which is an int. This is an internal conf so we don't have a serious compatibility issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTODO","created_at":"2017-06-09T08:48:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-30T16:56:02Z","closed_at":"2017-10-30T16:56:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"136ada5d2b6c3a56e983ddb3fceb6f5ca75281f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13cdabab49806e245caca8064ef3e6625892b337","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:sort","ref":"sort","sha":"13cdabab49806e245caca8064ef3e6625892b337","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, hive's stats are read into `CatalogStatistics`, while spark's stats are also persisted through `CatalogStatistics`. As a result, hive's stats can be unexpectedly propagated into spark' stats.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a catalog table, we read stats from hive, e.g. \"totalSize\" and put it into `CatalogStatistics`. Then, by using \"ALTER TABLE\" command, we will store the stats in `CatalogStatistics` into metastore as spark's stats (because we don't know whether it's from spark or not). But spark's stats should be only generated by \"ANALYZE\" command. This is unexpected from this command.\r\n\r\nSecondly, now that we have spark's stats in metastore, after inserting new data, although hive updated \"totalSize\" in metastore, we still cannot get the right `sizeInBytes` in `CatalogStatistics`, because we respect spark's stats (should not exist) over hive's stats.\r\n\r\nA running example is shown in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21031).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we add a new method `alterTableStats` to store spark's stats, and let `alterTable` keep existing stats.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe precision and scale of decimal values are wrong when the input is BigDecimal between -1.0 and 1.0. \r\n\r\nThe BigDecimal's precision is the digit count starts from the leftmost nonzero digit based on the [JAVA's BigDecimal definition](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html). However, our Decimal decision follows the database decimal standard, which is the total number of digits, including both to the left and the right of the decimal point. Thus, this PR is to fix the issue by doing the conversion.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the following queries failed:\r\n```SQL\r\nselect 1 > 0.0001\r\nselect floor(0.0001)\r\nselect ceil(0.0001)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases.","created_at":"2017-06-08T23:37:09Z","updated_at":"2017-06-10T17:31:25Z","closed_at":"2017-06-10T17:31:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"095a86f1ab279fb9160ead27eb5f9334b561c7ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18244/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18244/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18244/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d36be12650b4aa11c1dc5e0eda9baff6bac2785c","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:bigdecimal","ref":"bigdecimal","sha":"d36be12650b4aa11c1dc5e0eda9baff6bac2785c","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

good choice from the perspective of system\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe default properties file spark-defaults.conf shouldn't be ignore to load even though the submit arg --properties-file is set. The reasons are very easy to see:\r\n\r\n1. Infrastructure team need continually update the spark-defaults.conf when they want set something as default for entire cluster as a tuning purpose.\r\n2. Application developer only want to override the parameters they really want rather than others they even doesn't know (Set by infrastructure team).\r\n3. The purpose of using --properties-file from most of application developers is to avoid setting dozens of --conf k=v. But if spark-defaults.conf is ignored, the behaviour becomes unexpected finally.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nCurrent implement\r\nDefault configuration file:\r\n\r\n> spark.A=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.B=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.D=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.E=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.F=\"foo\"\r\n\r\nUse-special file:\r\n\r\n> spark.A=\"bar\"\r\n> spark.C=\"bar\"\r\n> spark.D=\"foo\"\r\n\r\nThe result:\r\n\r\n> spark.A=\"bar\"\r\n> spark.C=\"bar\"\r\n> spark.D=\"foo\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected right implement\r\nThe result:\r\n\r\n> spark.A=\"bar\"\r\n> spark.B=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.C=\"bar\"\r\n> spark.D=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.E=\"foo\"\r\n> spark.F=\"foo\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModify the UT of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code, blockIds in `OpenBlocks` are stored in the iterator on shuffle service. \r\nThere are some redundant characters in  blockId(`\"shuffle_\" + shuffleId + \"_\" + mapId + \"_\" + reduceId`). This pr proposes to improve the footprint and alleviate the memory pressure on shuffle
