is often more efficient to deal with large fields of type \"bytes\" as ByteBuffer objects, rather than Java arrays.  ByteBuffers can be used in a \"zero-copy\" fashion, where they simply serve as pointers into already allocated memory.  This avoids the need to copy the data, as would be necessary when using a regular Java byte array.\r\n\r\nThere is a drawback to using zero-copy ByteBuffers, though: when they are used, the ByteBuffer from which we deserialized the request must remain valid until we're done with the request.  So the underlying buffer cannot be reused during this period.  Therefore, we don't want all bytes fields to show up as ByteBuffers.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a \"style\" field to the RPC specifications which allows specifying that a \"bytes\" field should be deserialized as a zero-copy ByteBuffer rather than as a byte array.","created_at":"2019-07-03T23:53:09Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T19:23:07Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T19:23:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"525fe15b423d98afa971facb1549b8647d207103","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2bfbc1d5551338c863b586a5bd22c120ed97a271","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-8628","ref":"KAFKA-8628","sha":"2bfbc1d5551338c863b586a5bd22c120ed97a271","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

#7000 added a method to the `KafkaVersion` class used in the Kafka system tests. Until then, ConnectDistributed tests passed a string as the version, and this happened to work since no methods were required. But the `KafkaVersion.support_named_listeners()` method added in #7000 and required in `tests/kafkatest/services/kafka/templates/kafka.properties` appears to have broken the ConnectDistributed system tests. Changing the latter to use `KafkaVersion` instead of string fixes the system tests.\r\n\r\nI'll run a system test build before this should be merged to `trunk` and at least `2.3` (ideally back to `1.0`).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

the ability for the connector handles and task handles, which are used by the monitorable source and sink connectors used to verify the functionality of the Connect framework, to record the number of times the connector and tasks have each been started, and to allow a test to obtain a `RestartLatch` that can be used to block until the connectors and/or tasks have been restarted a specified number of types.\r\n\r\nTypically, a test will get the `ConnectorHandle` for a connector, and call the `ConnectorHandle.expectedRestarts(int)` method with the expected number of times that the connector and/or tasks will be restarted, and will hold onto the resulting `RestartLatch`. The test will then change the connector (or otherwise cause the connector to restart) one or more times as desired, and then call `RestartLatch.await(long, TimeUnit)` to block the test up to a specified duration for the connector and all tasks to be started the specified number of times.\r\n\r\nThis commit also increases several of the maximum wait times used in other integration tests. It doesn’t hurt to potentially wait longer, since most test runs will not need to wait the maximum amount of time anyway. However, in the rare cases that do need that extra time, waiting a bit more is fine if we can reduce the flakiness and minimize test failures that happened to time out too early.\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added for the new `RestartLatch` and `StopAndStartCounter` utility classes. This PR only affects the tests and does not affect any runtime code or API.\r\n\r\n**This should be merged on `trunk` and backported to the `2.3.x` branch.**\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

often use the RocksDBConfigSetter to modify parameters such as cache or block size, which must be set through the BlockBasedTableConfig object. Rather than creating a new object in the config setter, however, users should most likely retrieve a reference to the existing one so as to not lose the other defaults (eg the BloomFilter)\r\n\r\nThere have been notes from the community that it is not obvious this should be done, nor is it immediately clear how to do so. This PR updates the RocksDBConfigSetter docs to hopefully improve things.\r\n\r\nI also piggybacked a few minor cleanups in the docs

PR (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6938) added partial support for named listeners to kafka.py. Though we did run full test suite, somehow we missed one of the upgrade tests.\r\nSince upgrade tests start kafka from older versions, they may try to start it from a version that doesn't support named listeners yet. \r\nThis PR addresses the issue by adding a method to `version.py` called `supports_named_listeners()` and calling that method from kafka.properties template. \r\nAccording to KIP-103 (KAFKA-4636), `inter.broker.listener.name` property was introduced in 0.10.2.0, so I used this value in `supports_named_listeners()` method.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nVerified that a previously failing test passes locally.\r\nRan upgrade tests on Jenkins - https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/2747, all green\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-26T01:05:08Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T17:29:11Z","closed_at":"2019-06-27T16:50:18Z","merged_at":"2019-06-27T16:50:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"594d0430377446e672322e8ef3f509eca419ec46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1bb25f8f39af4476cc82817609ce374b2df4d429","head":{"label":"stan-is-hate:check-failing-test","ref":"check-failing-test","sha":"1bb25f8f39af4476cc82817609ce374b2df4d429","user":{"login":"stan-is-hate","id":49661990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjYxOTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49661990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate","html_url":"https://github.com/stan-is-hate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":191442483,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE0NDI0ODM=","name":"kafka-ccs","full_name":"stan-is-hate/kafka-ccs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stan-is-hate","id":49661990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjYxOTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49661990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate","html_url":"https://github.com/stan-is-hate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stan-is-hate/kafka-ccs","description":"Mirror

if the producer for a source task failed to send a record with a non-retriable error, the record would be silently skipped over. The source task would be allowed to commit offsets for the skipped record, and its status would remain at `RUNNING`.\r\n\r\nThe changes here cause source tasks to transition to the `FAILED` state if their producers fail to send a record with a non-retriable error, and they also change the logic for offset commits to wait for confirmation that records have made it to Kafka before their offsets can be committed.\r\n\r\nTested by running Connect unit tests locally.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

than before in the `WorkerConfigTransformer` in terms of ignoring any error returned from the callback. Do we still want to behave in the same way or we would like to handle any potential error? 🤔 maybe we can rely on the `scheduleReload` retrying again whenever the TTL expires or the connector task fails due to a stale configuration. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

2.13 support was added to build via #5454. This PR adjusts the code so that\r\nit compiles with 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Add `scala-collection-compat` dependency.\r\n* Import `scala.collection.Seq` in a number of places for consistent behavior between\r\nScala 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13.\r\n* Remove wildcard imports that were causing the Java classes to have priority over the\r\nScala ones, related Scala issue: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6589.\r\n* Replace parallel collection usage with `Future`. The former is no longer included by\r\ndefault in the standard library.\r\n* Replace val _: Unit workaround with one that is more concise and works with Scala 2.13\r\n* Replace `filterKeys` with `filter` when we expect a `Map`. `filterKeys` returns a view\r\nthat doesn't implement the `Map` trait in Scala 2.13.\r\n* Replace `mapValues` with `map` or add a `toMap` as an additional transformation\r\nwhen we expect a `Map`. `mapValues` returns a view that doesn't implement the\r\n`Map` trait in Scala 2.13.\r\n* Replace `breakOut` with `iterator` and `to`, `breakOut` was removed in Scala\r\n2.13.\r\n* Replace to() with toMap, toIndexedSeq and toSet\r\n* Replace `mutable.Buffer.--` with `filterNot`.\r\n* ControlException is an abstract class in Scala 2.13.\r\n* Variable arguments can only receive arrays or immutable.Seq in Scala 2.13.\r\n* Use `Factory` instead of `CanBuildFrom` in DecodeJson. `CanBuildFrom` behaves\r\na bit differently in Scala 2.13 and it's been deprecated. `Factory` has the behavior\r\nwe need and it's available via the compat library.\r\n* Fix failing tests due to behavior change in Scala 2.13,\r\n\"Map.values.map is not strict in Scala 2.13\" (https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/11589).\r\n* Use Java collections instead of Scala ones in StreamResetter (a Java class).\r\n* Adjust CheckpointFile.write to take an `Iterable` instead of `Seq` to avoid\r\nunnecessary collection copies.\r\n* Fix DelayedElectLeader to use a Map instead of Set and avoid `to` call that\r\ndoesn't work in Scala 2.13.\r\n* Use unordered map for mapping in SimpleAclAuthorizer, mapping of ordered\r\nmaps require an `Ordering` in Scala 2.13 for safety reasons.\r\n* Adapt `ConsumerGroupCommand` to compile with Scala 2.13.\r\n* CoreUtils.min takes an `Iterable` instead of `TraversableOnce`, the latter does\r\nnot exist in Scala 2.13.\r\n* Replace `Unit` with `()` in a couple places. Scala 2.13 is stricter when it expects\r\na value instead of a type.\r\n* Fix bug in CustomQuotaCallbackTest where we did not necessarily set `partitionRatio`\r\ncorrectly, `forall` can terminate early.\r\n* Add a couple of spotbugs exclusions that are needed by code generated by Scala 2.13\r\n* Remove unused variables, simplify some code and remove procedure syntax in a few\r\nplaces.\r\n* Remove unused `CoreUtils.JSONEscapeString`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

is an updated implementation of #5844 by @MayureshGharat (with Mayuresh's permission).\r\n\r\n> Today when we call KafkaConsumer.poll(), it will fetch data from Kafka asynchronously and is put in to a local buffer (completedFetches).\r\n>\r\n> If now we pause some TopicPartitions and call KafkaConsumer.poll(), we might throw away any buffered data that we might have in the local buffer for these TopicPartitions. Generally, if an application is calling pause on some TopicPartitions, it is likely to resume those TopicPartitions in near future, which would require KafkaConsumer to re-issue a fetch for the same data that it had buffered earlier for these TopicPartitions. This is a wasted effort from the application's point of view.\r\n\r\nI've reviewed the original PR's feedback from @hachikuji and reimplemented this solution to add completed fetches that belong to paused partitions back to the queue.  I also rebased against the latest trunk which caused more changes as a result of subscription event handlers being removed from the fetcher class.\r\n\r\nYou can find more details in my updated notes

what\r\nNow that we have an abstraction for listeners, people should be allowed to pass in certain overrides for their listeners. This allows a user to override both client & interbroker listeners with a dictionary of configs.\r\n\r\n### why\r\nThere may be certain listener configs a user would want to override. Currently, to do so, they would either have to completely override all listener configs OR try to shoehorn an override based on the name of the security-protocol or an internal constant. This makes things a bit cleaner such that we handle the prefixing and simply add on some additional configs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

the log contains out of order message formats (for example v2 message followed by v1 message) and consists of compressed batches typically greater than 1kB in size, it is possible for down-conversion to fail. With compressed batches, we estimate the size of down-converted batches using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private static int estimateCompressedSizeInBytes(int size, CompressionType compressionType) {\r\n        return compressionType == CompressionType.NONE ? size : Math.min(Math.max(size / 2, 1024), 1 << 16);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis almost always underestimates size of down-converted records if the batch is between 1kB-64kB in size. In general, this means we may under estimate the total size required for compressed batches.\r\n\r\nBecause of an implicit assumption in the code that messages with a lower message format appear before any with a higher message format, we do not grow the buffer we copy the down converted records into when we see a message <= the target message format. This assumption becomes incorrect when the log contains out of order message formats, for example because of leaders flapping while upgrading the message format.","created_at":"2019-06-20T00:24:07Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T16:41:12Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T16:36:30Z","merged_at":"2019-06-21T16:36:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f8b2898ce512b9d1390857e036bb3a896dca170","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1bf1ba9ba9f1bf4a3560075603d95437c2e70175","head":{"label":"dhruvilshah3:downconversion-bug","ref":"downconversion-bug","sha":"1bf1ba9ba9f1bf4a3560075603d95437c2e70175","user":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121815241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE4MTUyNDE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"dhruvilshah3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3/kafka","description":"Mirror

of issue: connector validation fails if an alias is used for the converter since the validation for that is done via `ConfigDef.validateAll(...)`, which in turn invokes `Class.forName(...)` on the alias. Even though the class is successfully loaded by the `DelegatingClassLoader`, some Java implementations will refuse to return a class from `Class.forName(...)` whose name differs than the argument provided.\r\n\r\nSummary of fix: alter `ConfigDef.parseType(...)` to _first_ invoke `ClassLoader.loadClass(...)` on the class in order to get a handle on the actual class object to be loaded, _then_ invoke `Class.forName(...)` with the fully-qualified class name of the to-be-loaded class and return the result. The invocation of `Class.forName(...)` is necessary in order to allow static initialization to take place; simply calling `ClassLoader.loadClass(...)` is insufficient.\r\n\r\nSummary of testing: tested manually on trunk. Added unit test to `ConfigDefTest` that simulates the plugin-aliasing behavior of the `DelegatingClassLoader` and then invokes `ConfigDef.parseType` on an aliased class; this test fails on the current trunk but succeeds with the changes proposed here.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported at _least_ to 2.0; it's likely the issue goes back further than that but since it's been around for so long and has yet to be noted by anyone else it doesn't seem worth the effort to backport that much further if there are any significant merge conflicts.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

a few Javadoc issues:\r\n\r\n1) Do not end comments with `**/`\r\n\r\n2) Align leading asterisks\r\n\r\n3) Start comments with `/**` instead of `/*`\r\n    Javadoc comments must start with `/**`.\r\n    When starting with `/*`, Javadoc tools do not recognize those comments as Javadoc comments, it thinks they are simple block comments, and does not associate them with their class / member.\r\n\r\n4) Fix dangling Javadoc comments\r\n\r\n5) Avoid `@see` in the middle of Javadoc\r\n    When the `@see` tag is in the middle of a Javadoc comment, the Javadoc tool thinks the rest of the comment is part of the `@see` description.\r\n    There are two ways to fix this:\r\n    - If we really want an `@see` tag, we can move it at the bottom of the comment, where tags are supposed to be.\r\n    - When we want a link in the middle of the content, we can do: `See <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">Link title</a>.`\r\n\r\n6) Fix `@throws` syntax\r\nAn `@throws` declaration should be followed by the exception name, not by an `@link` or an `@see`.\r\n\r\n\r\nI followed the Javadoc / Scaladoc guidelines as well as Stephen Colebourne's article about Javadoc coding standards: https://blog.joda.org/2012/11/javadoc-coding-standards.html .\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation\r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-17T20:29:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T11:44:59Z","closed_at":"2019-07-04T11:44:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf8b53b0de49823daca62c9cface257aed3f5313","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d45ee8e4022fc47448de7ac9684671ec440d6833","head":{"label":"eneveu:improve-javadoc-style","ref":"improve-javadoc-style","sha":"d45ee8e4022fc47448de7ac9684671ec440d6833","user":{"login":"eneveu","id":384271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu","html_url":"https://github.com/eneveu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":191607139,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE2MDcxMzk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"eneveu/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eneveu","id":384271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu","html_url":"https://github.com/eneveu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eneveu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eneveu/kafka","description":"Mirror
