session cache performance is currently a blocker for increasing cache size.\r\n\r\n[Edit 9/28] With commit f528df6, now following the original cache eviction logic. The following benchmark data for sessions_lastUsed has been updated to reflect this change. \r\n\r\n## Summary of changes \r\n#### @lbradstreet\r\n- JMH benchmark to log performance improvements\r\n- making `EvictableKey`'s `compareTo` method faster\r\n- restructuring of `tryEvict` [Edit 9/28 - partially reverted] \r\n- ~~restructuring of `touch`~~ [Edit 9/28 - reverted]\r\n    - ~~`evictableBy` treemaps changed to store unprivileged and privileged sessions respectively~~\r\n\r\n#### ahuang98\r\n - `sessions` turned into LinkedHashMap (from mutable.HashMap) to absorb function of `lastUsed`\r\n    - entries in `sessions` are now ordered by the time the session was last touched\r\n -  ~~`evictableBy` treemaps renamed to `unprivilegedSessions` and `privilegedSesions`~~ [Edit 9/28 - reverted]\r\n - [Edit 9/28] `evictableByAll` updated to store only unprivileged sessions that have been touched > `evictionMs` after their creation\r\n    - previously stored privileged sessions that had been touched > `evictionMs` after their creation as well, which was unnecessary as `evictEntry` was only ever called on `evictableByAll` if the new session was unprivileged (and unprivileged can never evict unstale privileged sessions)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n - Unit test\r\n    - ~~assertion in `testSessionCache` currently commented out due to misunderstanding of cache eviction behavior~~ [Edit 9/28 - reverted]\r\n    - [Edit 9/28] new test added called `testSessionCacheEvictionRules`, which continues where `testSessionCache` left off, testing more combinations of [privileged, unprivileged], [smaller, larger], [stale, unstale] sessions trying to evict each other\r\n - JMH benchmark\r\n    - [Edit 9/28] after reverting back to original cache eviction logic (and updating benchmark to include the case when fetch session size stays the same and when fetch session size increases), the benchmark was rerun on an aws ec2 instance with 5 warmup and 5 measurement iterations. It shows that the performance of the optimized code with cache size 5000 is better than performance of trunk with cache size 1000. The table below highlights a portion of the results (cache size 2000 removed for brevity). \r\n\r\n| benchPrivileged | cacheSize | cacheUtilization | fetchSessionAddedPartitions | newSession |

PR does two things:\r\n* As stated in KIP-599, we'd like to disable the automatic retry of `THROTTLING_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` errors in order to avoid letting the command hangs until `default.api.timeout.ms` is reached.\r\n* Change the default value of `ErrorMessage` to `null` in the `DeleteTopicsResponse`. I have noted that it defaults to an empty string at the moment. The Admin client only uses the default message when the `ErrorMessage` is `null` so we end up with an empty message provided back to the user when `ErrorMessage` is not explicitly set by the broker.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-24T08:47:58Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T14:58:32Z","closed_at":"2020-09-25T14:57:20Z","merged_at":"2020-09-25T14:57:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"89485fe137588531744752bd772aabe78cd4f374","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ac04463df97aad9ca5f2b8ce959ed1e9c5de17ec","head":{"label":"dajac:KAFKA-10516","ref":"KAFKA-10516","sha":"ac04463df97aad9ca5f2b8ce959ed1e9c5de17ec","user":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40044750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA0NDc1MA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"dajac/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dajac/kafka","description":"Mirror

`org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Values#parse` method parses integers, which are larger than `Long.MAX_VALUE` as `double` with `Schema.FLOAT64_SCHEMA`.\r\n\r\nThat means we are losing precision for these larger integers.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSchemaAndValue schemaAndValue = Values.parseString(\"9223372036854775808\");\r\n```\r\nreturns:\r\n```\r\nSchemaAndValue{schema=Schema{FLOAT64}, value=9.223372036854776E18}\r\n```\r\nAlso, this method parses values, that can be parsed as `FLOAT32` to `FLOAT64`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes parsing logic, to use `FLOAT32`/`FLOAT64` for numbers that don't have and fraction part(`decimal.scale()!=0`) only, and use an arbitrary-precision `org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal` otherwise.\r\nAlso, it updates the method to parse numbers, that can be represented as `float` to `FLOAT64`.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests, that cover parsing `BigInteger`, `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double` types.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

even distribution of lost/new tasks when more than one worker joins the group at the same time\r\n\r\nIssue description:\r\nExisting issue 1 description : When more than one worker joins the consumer group the incremental co operative assignor revokes and re assigns atmost average number of tasks per worker.\r\n\r\nIssue: This results in the additional workers joining the group stay idle and would require more future rebalances to happen to have even distribution of tasks.\r\n\r\nFix: As part of task assignment calculation following a deployment, the reassignment of tasks are calculated by revoking all the tasks above ceil(average) number of tasks.\r\n\r\nExisting issue 2 description: When more than one worker is lost and rejoins the group at most one worker will be re assigned with the lost tasks from all the workers that left the group.\r\n\r\nIssue: In scenarios where more than one worker is lost and rejoins the group only one among them gets assigned all the partitions that were lost in the past. The additional workers that have joined would not get any task assigned to them until a rebalance that happens in future.\r\n\r\nFix: As part fo lost task re assignment all the new workers that have joined the group would be considered for task assignment and would be assigned in a round robin fashion with the new tasks.\r\n\r\nTesting strategy : System testing in a Kube environment completed.\r\nUT : updated to

PR adds metric to track throttle time of connection accept rate (when hitting connection attempt rate quota), which is a part of KIP-612:\r\n> kafka.network:type=socket-server-metrics,name=connection-accept-throttle-time,listener={listenerName}\r\n> Type: SampledStat.Avg\r\n> Description: Average throttle time due to violating per-listener or broker-wide connection acceptance rate quota on a given listener.\r\n\r\nThis PR also does 2 fixes:\r\n* Ensures that per-listener connection quotas are configured on broker startup (from static broker config, if one is set). \r\n* Reduces quota values used in testDynamicListenerConnectionCreationRateQuota test, and the duration of `verifyConnectionRate` (that creates connections and verifies rate). We observed once that this test exhausted ephemeral port count. I reduced quotas used in this test by half, since this does not change the correctness of the test, while it also reduces the number of connections made by this test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

the producer/consumer properties override for the MirrorSourceTask and OffsetSyncStore do not work. This is due the props stored into MirrorConnectorConfig have a `target.cluster` or `source.cluster` prefix. For example:\r\n```\r\nsource.cluster.producer.bootstrap.servers -> localhost:9092\r\ntarget.cluster.consumer.max.poll.interval.ms -> 120000\r\ntarget.cluster.consumer.auto.offset.reset -> latest\r\nsource.cluster.admin.bootstrap.servers -> localhost:9092\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [sourceConsumerConfig](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/aa0cd667bcd5c4025e84097192030b59165ac9d0/connect/mirror/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/mirror/MirrorConnectorConfig.java#L240) will strip this prefix and store all props as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproducer.bootstrap.servers -> localhost:9092\r\nconsumer.auto.offset.reset -> latest\r\nconsumer.max.poll.interval.ms -> 120000\r\nalias -> A\r\nbootstrap.servers -> localhost:9092\r\nadmin.bootstrap.servers -> localhost:9092\r\nconsumer.bootstrap.servers -> localhost:9092\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next line `props.keySet().retainAll(MirrorClientConfig.CLIENT_CONFIG_DEF.names());` will strip all the props not defined in this common CLIENT_CONFIG_DEF definition. Not relevant but can be confusing if you think the next line will filter on the current values in props.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `props.putAll(originalsWithPrefix(CONSUMER_CLIENT_PREFIX));` is based on the on the `originals` variable that have the `target.cluster` or `source.cluster` prefix. There's no single property with the \"consumer.\" prefix. This patterns repeats with the producer config.\r\n\r\nThis PR also allows to override the hardcoded `auto.offset.reset` value.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

JsonNodeType in JsonConverter.\r\n\r\nFrom v2.10.0 onwards, in jackson lib, ObjectMapper.readTree(input) started to return JsonNode of type MISSING for empty input, as mentioned in the issue: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2211.\r\n\r\nThis caused to throw a `DataException[\"Unknown schema type: null\"]` when an empty message key was parsed to be converted to Connect

The `schemaType` for `MISSING` type of JsonNode was returned as null, which resulted in this exception. \r\n \r\nAs part of this PR, made changes in JsonParser to incorporate the Jackson's ObjectMapper treatment of empty input from v2.10.0 onwards.

test StreamsBrokerBounceTest.test_all_brokers_bounce() fails on\r\n2.5 because in the last stage of the test there is only one broker\r\nleft and the offset commit cannot succeed because the\r\nmin.insync.replicas of __consumer_offsets is set to 2 and acks is\r\nset to all. This causes a time out and extends the closing of the\r\nKafka Streams client to beyond the duration passed to the close\r\nmethod of the client.\r\n\r\nThis affects especially the 2.5 branch since there Kafka Streams\r\ncommits offsets for each task, i.e., close() needs to wait for the\r\ntimeout for each task. In 2.6 and trunk the offset commit is done\r\nper thread, so close() does only need to wait for one time out per\r\nstream thread.\r\n\r\nI opened this PR on trunk, since the test could also become\r\nflaky on trunk and we want to avoid diverging system tests across\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nA more complete solution would be to improve the test by defining\r\na better success criteria.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

the requirement for unique port numbers for the advertised.listener parameters.\r\nThis restriction makes for the listeners parameter but there's not reason to apply the\r\nsame logic for advertised.listeners.\r\n\r\nBeing able to do this opens possibilities for some practical applications when using\r\nKerberos authentication. For example, when configuring Kafka using Kerberos authentication\r\nand a Load Balancer we need to have two SASL_SSL listeners: (A) one running with the\r\nkafka/hostname principal and (B) another using kafka/lb_name, which is necessary for\r\nproper authentication when using the LB FQDN. After bootstrap, though, the client receives\r\nthe brokers' addresses with the actual host FQDNs advertised by the brokers. To connect\r\nto the brokerd using the hostnames the client must connect to the listener A to be able to\r\nauthenticate successfully with Kerberos.\r\n\r\nAll unit/integration tests have passed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [X] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [X] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [X] Verify documentation

patch fixes a couple problems with the use of the `StructRegistry`. First, it fixes registration so that it is consistently based on the typename of the struct. Previously structs were registered under the field name which meant that fields which referred to common structs resulted in multiple entries. Second, the patch fixes `SchemaGenerator` so that common structs are considered first.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

patch bumps the `Fetch` protocol as specified by KIP-595: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-595%3A+A+Raft+Protocol+for+the+Metadata+Quorum. The main differences are the following:\r\n\r\n- Truncation detection \r\n- Leader discovery through the response\r\n- Flexible version support\r\n\r\nThe most notable change is truncation detection. This patch adds logic in the request handling path to detect truncation, but it does not change the replica fetchers to make use of this capability. We are planning to do this separately.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-09T21:27:56Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T13:19:18Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T20:38:17Z","merged_at":"2020-09-15T20:38:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"634c9175054cc69d10b6da22ea1e95edff6a4747","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/00867faf4ec2ac8b520191320832e88eb8fd1e83","head":{"label":"hachikuji:KAFKA-10435","ref":"KAFKA-10435","sha":"00867faf4ec2ac8b520191320832e88eb8fd1e83","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

Goal\r\n\r\nAllow regex for MaskField SMT to replacement\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThe existing `org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField` SMT allow to masking with literal replacement. This PR introduces addtional config param `regex`, which will be applied to match for replacement.\r\n\r\nexample config :\r\n\r\n```\r\ntransforms=IPMask\r\ntransforms.IPMask.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.MaskField$Value\r\ntransforms.IPMask.fields=ipAddress\r\ntransforms.IPMask.replacement=$1.$2.xxx.xxx\r\ntransforms.IPMask.regex=(\\\\d*)\\\\.(\\\\d*)\\\\.\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*\r\n```\r\n\r\nexample

\"123.45.***.***\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Restrictions :\r\n\r\n* only string values ar supported\r\n* regex is ignored when `replacement` is not set up.\r\n\r\nif `regex` config is set without `replacement` config, the `regex` config is ignored. and then field value will be replaced with null

Rate() metric with quota config, we update quota by updating config of KafkaMetric. However, it is not enough for TokenBucket, because it uses quota config on record() to properly calculate the number of tokens. Sensor passes config stored in the corresponding StatAndConfig, which currently never changes. This means that after updating quota via KafkaMetric.config, which is our current and only method, Sensor would record the value using old quota but then measure the value to check for quota violation using the new quota value. This PR adds update method to Sensor that properly updates quota for TokenBucket.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

On 2.12 explicit import of `org.apache.kafka.streams.scala.serialization.Serdes` has less priority than `org.apache.kafka.streams.scala.Serdes` in tests inside `org.apache.kafka.streams.scala`
