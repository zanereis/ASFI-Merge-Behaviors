In the `init` method, we traverse through all OpenCL devices and check their version. If the version is older than the target version in TVM, then we notify the user that we will skip this device. We cannot throw any exception from method `init` because it is possible that you have compiled host code with OpenCL support, but the host device won't have any OpenCL device which is supported by TVM (e.g. they all have too old version of libOpenCL.so or there is no OpenCL driver installed). From OpenCL codegen we call function OpenCLModuleCreate. In the OpenCLModuleCreate init function might be called and in this case an exception will be generated on the host side although that the target device might be supported by TVM. This is why we don't throw any exceptions in the init function.\r\n\r\nIf in the runtime we use some OpenCL methods and the list of the devices is empty, then we will generate an exception and notify user that possible reason is because version of libOpenCL.so is too old.","created_at":"2022-11-18T15:48:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T10:21:07Z","closed_at":"2022-11-18T20:23:48Z","merged_at":"2022-11-18T20:23:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfb4c00197c609207c294bf764bcec128c7a7775","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f5cdd41730f2796e3ba14196c5c3017dac510b8e","head":{"label":"echuraev:echuraev/improve_opencl_device_version_detection","ref":"echuraev/improve_opencl_device_version_detection","sha":"f5cdd41730f2796e3ba14196c5c3017dac510b8e","user":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317515420,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc1MTU0MjA=","name":"tvm","full_name":"echuraev/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"echuraev","id":5525113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev","html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echuraev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/echuraev/tvm","description":"Open

though the operator precedence of `And` has a higher precedence than `Or`, removing parentheses based on this precedence can harm readability.  This commit adds an exception to the TVMScript rules for parentheses, to always insert parentheses between `And` and `Or` operators.\r\n\r\nIn addition, adding a rewrite rule to preferentially produce And/Or chains that may be expressed in a single left-associative chain of operators.\r\n\r\nBetween these two changes, the readability of boolean expressions can be improved.  Below is the motivating example for this change.  In each case, the output had been passed through the `black` formatter. Both expressions are equivalent, but the before-case was much more difficult to read.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = (\r\n    AAA == 0\r\n    and BBB < 4\r\n    or AAA == 7\r\n    and 6 <= BBB\r\n    or (CCC

to this commit, loop iterators were named `i0`, `i1`, and so on, while the `BlockNode::iter_vars` used the name from the TE `IterVar`. As a result, after `BlockNode::iter_vars` is lowered out, the resulting `PrimFunc` no longer contained the user-generated iterator names.  This commit updates the TIR conversion so that the loop iterators take the name of the TE `IterVar`, and the `BlockNode::iter_vars` are named `v_$IterVarName`.","created_at":"2022-11-18T14:39:42Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T14:17:50Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T14:17:44Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T14:17:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2dd53d5315b3073a14ced200ab55426ac69904e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c71055208b74ca9b5609c0b07a46f8a0c25fd76e","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:te_to_tir_loop_naming","ref":"te_to_tir_loop_naming","sha":"c71055208b74ca9b5609c0b07a46f8a0c25fd76e","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`static` qualifier on the constant index causes a problem, when `TECompiler` is invoked on the same module multiple times. Since the names of constants become different in each call to `TECompiler`, anything that depends on the consistency of constant names is broken. \r\n\r\nIn practice, MetaSchedule tuning is affected by this issue, since task extraction and the final `relay.build(...)` both invoke `TECompiler`.  So if we do `get_block(\"fused_constant_0_global\")` during tuning,  trace application after tuning will fail because there would be no longer a block with the name \"fused_constant_0_global\"

when `CacheRead` and `RewriteLayout` are used together, the index map is derived based on the cache read block, which leads to weird result. This is because the current implementation assumes that the \"layout-free\" buffer is directly consumed by an \"anchor\" op such as conv2d or dense.\r\n\r\nWhen `CacheRead` is involved, we need to find the index map for the cache-read buffer as it is consumed by an anchor op, and apply the same transformation to the layout-free buffer. My solution supports more general cases where there are multiple cache reads forming a \"chain\" of blocks, starting from the one that directly consumes the layout-free buffer passed as a parameter. So the layout transformation is back propagated over such chain. \r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @junrushao @nverke

Hexagon User DMA bypass mode based on user-specified `dma_bypass_cache` option for DMA copies between DDR and VTCM.  \r\n\r\nThe **upside** of this change is increased DMA bandwidth (up to 40 GBps observed using `test_vtcm_bandwidth.py`) and compute throughput using a 3-stage pipeline --- cache read, compute, cache write (up to 38 Gops using `test_parallel_hvx_load_vtcm.py`).\r\n\r\nThe **downside** of this change is the potential for data coherency issues resulting from the need to manage the cache in software when using DMA bypass hence the user `dma_bypass_cache` option to enable or disable bypass mode.\r\n\r\nThe strategy to manage the cache in software centers around the requirement for Hexagon to operate on `HexagonBuffer` objects regardless of scope --- DDR or VTCM.  When copying to / from a `HexagonBuffer` we aggressively invalidate the cache for both the source and destination, both before and after the copy.  Also note that the copy is now implemented with `memcpy` instead of DMA.  With the cache clean after copy to / from a `HexagonBuffer` we can now use DMA bypass mode.  However, **this software cache management strategy is NOT infallible** --- if a `HexagonBuffer` becomes dirty in the cache prior to a DMA with bypass mode enabled we may see data coherency issues.\r\n\r\nAlso simplifies Hexagon DMA flows by removing the unused `mem_copy` instrinsic and lowering as well as the `hexagon_user_dma_1d_sync` helper function which is replaced by calls to `HexagonUserDMA::Copy` and

Partition splits a loop into two sequential loops based on a factor.

example: in the current TVMScript, the snippet below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(...):\r\n    A = T.match_buffer[(128 * 128), \"float32\"]\r\n                       ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nis actually different from this one:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(...):\r\n    A = T.match_buffer[(16384, ), \"float32\"]\r\n                       ^^^^^^^^^\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because 128 * 128 is not immediately constant-folded into 16384, but becomes an AST node: `T.Mul(128, 128)`. This can be quite error-prone if not used carefully.\r\n\r\nAs part of effort of more formal TIR semantics, we want to more explicitly differentiate TIR AST nodes (defined in `tir/expr.h`) and TIR ops (defined in `tir/op.h`). The naming convention is that:\r\n- Lowercased methods, for example, `tvm.tir.mul` or operator `*`, means an TIR op, which will be eagerly constant-folded, i.e. `mul(1, 2)` returns `3` immediately rather than creating an AST node.\r\n- Capitalized callable, for example, `Mul`, means creating an AST node without constant folding.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes this behavior more explictly by printing `T.Mul(a, b)` directly when `a` and `b` are both constants, rather than sugaring it into `mul(a. b)` or `a * b`, so that the difference between an op and an AST node is clarified.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Yaxing Cai

vectorization of shared to global store in tensor core auto tensorization is not done properly, since most blocks have the `T.where` predicate which disables vectorization. \r\n\r\nThe predicate is introduced after `Split` in cooperative fetch: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/meta_schedule/postproc/rewrite_cooperative_fetch.cc#L159-L162\r\nAs the code says, this split is supposed to be applied to a fused loop. This is the case for cache read blocks, where `AddReadReuse` explicitly fuses loops around cache read blocks. But `AddWriteReuseTensorCore` doesn't fuse loops after cache write: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/meta_schedule/schedule_rule/multi_level_tiling_tensor_core.cc#L260-L262. \r\n\r\nSo for cache rewrite blocks, we always try to split a single axis by large factors like `[None, 4, 32, 2]`. Unless the sampled factor for the axis is large, we always get `T.where` in the shared to global copy block.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the missing fusion. Now, all candidate samples have the shared to global copy block properly vectorized. But unfortunately, there was no perf improvement from this change after e2e tuning. \r\n\r\nFor quantized workloads, vectorization of shared to global copy is disabled, since we end up vectorizing also requantization-related math, involving 64 bit arithmetic. The generated code fails to compile currently.\r\n\r\n@vinx13 @junrushao

PR introduces a check to prevent records with run time of zero into the training data of cost model. This is because when working on microTVM there're cases where the run time of certain successful runs is very tiny, such that it got recorded as zero. In such cases, the runtime of 0 would break XGBoost model because it introduces infinite running speed in GFLOPs.

PR fixes the checking of devisor in constant folding of `tir::Div`. If the expression is `0. / 0.`, previous implementation directly folds it to `0.` without checking the divisor. It seems that `fb->value != 0` should not be in the `if` condition, but should be checked in the body instead. After this fix, folding `0. / 0.` leads to an assertion failure instead of `0.`. \r\n\r\nHere is a piece of simple testing code:`tir.FloatImm('float32', 0.) / tir.FloatImm('float32', 0.)`.

fixes #13330, which was blocking my work to write TIR schedules for microTVM.\r\n\r\nI originally thought I'd have to change the function signature of `DomainTouchedAccessMap`, but I couldn't think of a way to do that cleanly. Instead, I changed `extern_primfunc` to use `primfunc.params` to create the buffer lists in the right order.\r\n\r\n#13330 should have been caught by `test_tir_te_extern_primfunc.py`, but one of that test's helper functions had the same bug as `extern_primfunc`. I've thus modified `test_tir_te_extern_primfunc.py` to instantiate the input tensors a different way, allowing it to catch regressions of this issue.\r\n\r\nWould love a look from

A workload from quantized models often have a trivial block which only produces a constant scalar:\r\n```\r\nwith T.block(\"compile_engine_const\"):\r\n    vi = T.axis.spatial(1, 0)\r\n    T.reads()\r\n    T.writes(compile_engine_const[()])\r\n    compile_engine_const[()] = 59\r\n```\r\nThis can be inlined by existing `AutoInline` rule, but depending on the order where spatial blocks are processed by `AutoInline`, these \"compile_engine_const\" blocks can get in the way of `ReverseComputeInline` on other blocks, since the constant blocks are also counted as a producer block. `PostOrderApply` currently processes the constant blocks at the very end, so `ReverseComputeInline` on blocks that consumes such constants always fails to inline. So in practice, we are not generating a fused kernel for quantized conv2d today.\r\n\r\nI added a simple inlining rule that inlines only such constant blocks. This rule is supposed to run before `AutoInline`, to unblock `ReverseComputeInline`. This lets us generate a fused kernel. On the int8 resnet50 model from PyTorch, the e2e perf improved from 6.8 to **5.2** msec, using batch size 16, and the same number of trials.   \r\n\r\n2. Currently, `VerifyGPUCode` only checks vector width used in `BufferLoad` and `BufferStore`. But quantized models uses specialized intrinsics like `q_multiply_shift_per_axis` below, which uses 64 bit arithmetic internally. \r\n```\r\nT_cast[v0 // 49, v0 % 49 // 7, v0 % 7, v1] = T.cast(T.max(T.min(T.q_multiply_shift_per_axis(conv2d_nhwc_reindex_shared[v0, v1] - p2[0, 0, 0, v1] + p3[0, 0, 0, v1], p4[v1], p5[v1], p6[v1], 31, False, True, dtype=\"int32\"), 255), 0), \"uint8\")\r\n```\r\nTo accurately account for data types used in a block, we need to lower those intrinsics before invoking TIR `VerifyGPUCode` and check the dtype of `CastNode`. \r\n\r\n@vinx13

AvgPool2d. As a result fake quantized `qnn.conv2d` gets input as int32 dtype, but it is forbidden for `qnn.conv2d` (supports only uint8/int8/int16).\r\n\r\n**This commit adds the following:**\r\nAdd cast back to input data type after AvgPool2d.

Currently the order of blocks to apply `AutoInline` is undefined, but I've hit a case where this is problematic. \r\n\r\nFor example, given these four blocks,\r\n```\r\n        for i0_7, i1_7, i2_7, i3_7 in T.grid(16, 56, 56, 256):\r\n            with T.block(\"compute_2\"):\r\n                i0_8, i1_8, i2_8, i3_8 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0_7, i1_7, i2_7, i3_7])\r\n                T.reads(T_subtract_1[i0_8, i1_8, i2_8, i3_8])\r\n                T.writes(compute_3[i0_8, i1_8, i2_8, i3_8])\r\n                compute_3[i0_8, i1_8, i2_8, i3_8] = T.q_multiply_shift(T_subtract_1[i0_8, i1_8, i2_8, i3_8], 1457846997, 31, 0, dtype=\"int32\")\r\n        for i0_9, i1_9, i2_9, i3_9 in T.grid(16, 56, 56, 256):\r\n            with T.block(\"compute_3\"):\r\n                i0_10, i1_10, i2_10, i3_10 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0_9, i1_9, i2_9, i3_9])\r\n                T.reads(p9[i0_10, i1_10, i2_10, i3_10])\r\n                T.writes(compute_4[i0_10, i1_10, i2_10, i3_10])\r\n                compute_4[i0_10, i1_10, i2_10, i3_10] = T.q_multiply_shift(p9[i0_10, i1_10, i2_10, i3_10], 2101000910, 31, 0, dtype=\"int32\")\r\n        for i0_11, i1_11, i2_11, i3_11 in T.grid(16, 56, 56, 256):\r\n            with T.block(\"T_add_2\"):\r\n                ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0_11, i1_11, i2_11, i3_11])\r\n                T.reads(compute_3[ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3], compute_4[ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3])\r\n                T.writes(T_add_2[ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3])\r\n                T_add_2[ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3] = compute_3[ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3] + compute_4[ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3]\r\n        for i0_12, i1_12, i2_12, i3_12 in T.grid(16, 56, 56, 256):\r\n            with T.block(\"compute_4\"):\r\n                i0_13, i1_13, i2_13, i3_13 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0_12, i1_12, i2_12, i3_12])\r\n                T.reads(T_add_2[i0_13, i1_13, i2_13, i3_13])\r\n                T.writes(compute[i0_13, i1_13, i2_13, i3_13])\r\n                compute[i0_13, i1_13, i2_13, i3_13] = T.max(T.min(T_add_2[i0_13, i1_13, i2_13, i3_13], 255), 0)\r\n```\r\n, we want to `AutoInline` \"compute_3\", \"T_add_2\" and \"compute_4\". If the order is \"T_add_2\" -> \"compute_3\" -> \"compute_4\", all three blocks can be inlined / reverse inlined to \"compute_2\". However, if the order is \"T_add_2\" -> \"compute_4\" -> \"compute_3\" , \"compute_4\" can neither be inlined or reverse inlined. This in turn can result in a buggy schedule to be generated (see the description in the test case).\r\n\r\nWe can avoid this problem by always `AutoInlin`ing the last block after all other blocks have been processed. This ensures that the last block can be reverse inlined. \r\n\r\n@vinx13 @junrushao @zxybazh

commit fixes the following issue:\r\nFor the sequence of ops qnn.dequantize -> avg_pool2d -> conv2d -> qnn.quantize FQ2I pass inserts qnn.requantize (or cast) to int32 unconditionally before avg_pool2d. As a result fake quantized qnn.conv2d gets input as int32 dtype, but it is forbidden for qnn.conv2d (supports only uint8/int8/int16).\r\nThis commit disables such behavoir and support int8/uint8 as
