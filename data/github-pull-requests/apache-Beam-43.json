not always possible to know if a transform consumes inputs, or can act as a root transform (and in fact some may be able to do both depending on their configuration), but when a transform expecting inputs doesn't get them the error can be quite obscure. This adds best-effort checking and a better error in that case.\r\n\r\nWe also allow explicitly setting empty imputs to work around this error (which is where most of the complexity of this change lies). Importantly, sources (no matter their name) are not required to have inputs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a larger cleanup of the release guide to clarify timings and positioning of the broader steps.\r\n\r\nLarger emphasis has been put on the Release Manager's role prior to the release cut. If issues are addressed in the main branch before the cut, they do not need to be addressed afterwards. The release manager is empowered to do so.\r\n\r\nClarify some timing around the begining and end of the release by calling out the preparation steps should be performed within the week prior to the release cut. Also call out that release finalization tasks can be done within a few hours of the release being completed.\r\n\r\nWhile the guide isn't materially shorter, maintaining the simpler structure as in the overview will make it less overwheling to release managers, since it's clearer when the various subtasks apply, vs the previous \"13\" steps. This should clarify the \"build release candidate + vote + fix\" loop that is the bulk of a release manager's tasks. I believe this will help get to release candidates sooner.\r\n\r\nAdd a new section \"Post Release Tasks\" which is where the Playground update task lives. While it's part of the release tasks, it doesn't block the release overall, so it felt weird structurally to have it as important as \"Build a Release Candidate\".\r\n\r\nVarious minor typos and fixes.\r\n\r\nRendered version should become available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/28287/contribute/release-guide/index.html\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR addresses #28080 by refactoring the static [BigQueryIO.read(SerializableFunction)](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.html#read-org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.SerializableFunction-) to not need a try/catch when invoking the DatumReaderFactory.\r\n\r\nThe existing code first converted the TableSchema to a JSON string using BigQueryIO.JSON_FACTORY's toString method. This throws an IOException that the original code logged as a warning. A GenericDatumTransformer's constructor received that JSON string that was used to set a private Suppler property, called tableSchema. This Supplier property, when invoked, would convert the JSON string back to a TableSchema object.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the code by creating a new GenericDatumTransformer constructor that receives the TableSchema directly and sets the internal TableSchema property, removing the need for a Supplier and the need to re-parse the JSON string back to a TableSchema.\r\n\r\nSince the existing GenericDatumTransformer constructor that received a JSON string representation of the TableSchema was public, I did not remove it.\r\n\r\nTo validate these changes, I ran:\r\n\r\n`./gradlew :sdks:java:io:google-cloud-platform:check`\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`./gradlew :sdks:java:io:google-cloud-platform:integrationTest`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a streaming load test for writing via Storage API sink. Includes exactly-one and at-least-once semantics.\r\n\r\nThis test is set up to first write rows using batch FILE_LOADS mode to a \"source of truth\" table. Afterwards, it will write the same rows in streaming mode with Storage API to a second table. Then it will query between these two tables to check that they are identical. There is also the option of providing an existing table with the expected data, in which case the test will skip the first step.\r\n\r\nThe throughput, length of test (in minutes), and data shape can be changed by adding a new configuration line.\r\n\r\nAlso including a small addition: we can set an interval for the sink to intentionally crash every now and then. This is intended to test retry resilience. The sink will sometimes throw an exception to simulate a work item failure, and other times will exit the system to simulate a worker failure. Either way, we expect the pipeline to pick up where it left off and deliver data appropriately.","created_at":"2023-08-31T15:31:33Z","updated_at":"2023-10-05T15:01:18Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T15:46:14Z","merged_at":"2023-10-03T15:46:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e0521162f6e23de29172eebfd3fd91f64329634","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1839326366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM5MzI2MzY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/build","name":"build","color":"cf8af7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/28264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/28264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/28264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/676b4c080f7f6241c3919f8e5ac8ae7fc519592d","head":{"label":"ahmedabu98:loadtest","ref":"loadtest","sha":"676b4c080f7f6241c3919f8e5ac8ae7fc519592d","user":{"login":"ahmedabu98","id":65791736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzkxNzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65791736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedabu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":447401958,"node_id":"R_kgDOGqrP5g","name":"beam","full_name":"ahmedabu98/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahmedabu98","id":65791736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzkxNzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65791736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedabu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedabu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedabu98/beam","description":"Apache

Beam project uses a remote cache node at [beam-cache.apache.org/cache](https://beam-cache.apache.org/cache/) to reduce build time. Only builds on [ci-beam.apache.org](https://ci-beam.apache.org/) are currently able to write to the cache.\r\n\r\nAs requested [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27015#issuecomment-1667925540), this PR allows the same level of access to the cache for GitHub Actions as is currently in place for Jenkins builds. This will require using a few GitHub Actions secrets in GitHub Actions workflows:\r\n- GE_ACCESS_TOKEN - An Apache organization secret that allows publishing build scans\r\n- GE_CACHE_USERNAME / GE_CACHE_PASSWORD - A Beam project secret that allows authenticating to the remote cache as a user with read/write permissions\r\n\r\nA few caveats to this PR:\r\n- GitHub Actions does not allow accessing secrets from PRs issued from forks. While a crucial security feature, it makes this PR difficult to test. It would be nice to validate against a feature branch within Beam before being merged.\r\n- The nature of authoring GitHub Actions requires quite a lot of repetition in this PR. While I do not see a better way to do this, I am certainly open to suggestions.\r\n- Future versions of Gradle Enterprise should allow us to do this in a way where we do not have to use the username/password secrets. When that day comes, we can make that update.\r\n\r\nfixes #28211\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

artifacts such as min, max, word_count are computed as an extra data point for the users. these artifacts are computed over the entire dataset and to output them along with the transformed elements, we need to broadcast the artifact size on to the transformed data size. By doing so,  we output same artifact value for each element in the entire dataset and this is expected since the values should be same for the entire dataset. This PR adds a warning for the users about this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the control connection for a job is lost, eg. by an SDK worker crash (detected via grpc stream context cancel), then fail all extant instructions, and terminate the job, rather than leave it running perpetually.\r\n\r\nFurther, ensure the extant bundles are cleaned up from the element manager, to allow failed jobs to be properly garbage collected.\r\n\r\nReduce routine log messages to debug to avoid noise.\r\n\r\nUse ctx.WithCancelCause properly, which requires calling context.Cause on the context.\r\n\r\nRestructures the bundle processing loop in execute.go to better allow for eager bundle splitting. Would need to move bundle data acquisition to be moved out of stage.Execute, and split there.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the Swift SDK for being in a crashing on worker state to reliably validate this.\r\n\r\nRelated #28187\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes while trying to use the experimental Swift SDK against prism.\r\n\r\n* Use an actual loopback address for endpoints instead of the net package listener default of unspecified.\r\n  * IPv6 uses \"[::]\" to mean an unspecified address, which Go then treats as the loopback address. This isn't true across all SDKs, so we must explicitly indicate the loopback address.\r\n  * Note: We create the server to listen to any traffic to that port however, so other connections, possibly off the machine, remain valid.\r\n* Increase default receive buffer to max.\r\n* Fail jobs if the SDK worker doesn't connect after 1 minute.\r\n* Error job failures on log on slog side.\r\n* Minor log clean up, to a debug log.\r\n\r\nRelated to #28187\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
