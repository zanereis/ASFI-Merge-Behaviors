of\nunstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a\nframework and SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM application might ingest plain\ntext and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for\nor located-at. UIMA enables such an application to be decomposed into components, for example\n&quot;language identification&quot; -&gt; &quot;language specific segmentation&quot; -&gt; &quot;sentence boundary detection&quot; -&gt;\n&quot;entity detection (person/place names etc.)&quot;. Each component must implement interfaces defined by\nthe framework and must provide self-describing metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework\nmanages these components and the data flow between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the\ndata that flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between these languages. UIMA\nadditionally provides capabilities to wrap components as network services, and can scale to very\nlarge volumes by replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of networked nodes.</p>\n<p>Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source implementation of the UIMA specification (that\nspecification is, in turn, being developed concurrently by a technical committee within\n<a href=\"http://www.oasis-open.org\">OASIS</a>, a standards organization). We invite and encourage you to\nparticipate in both the implementation and specification efforts.</p>\n<p>UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured content such as text, audio and video. It\ncomprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic components written in Java and C++,\nwith some support for Perl, Python and TCL.</p>\n<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notable changes in this release<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>\n<p>This is a bug fix release.</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs fixed</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/255\">#255</a>: File handle leak accessing performanceTuning.properties</li>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/240\">#240</a>: Helper annotation created by SelectFS should not survive</li>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/238\">#238</a>: Form 6 serializes non-reachable FSes but should not</li>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/235\">#235</a>: Misleading error message when JCas type is not registered</li>\n<li>🦟 [UIMA-6479] PearPackagingMavenPlugin has ancient JUnit dependency</li>\n<li>🦟 [UIMA-6473] CasToComparableText is broken</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>⭐️ Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/222\">#222</a>: Support comparing test files irrespective of line endings</li>\n<li>⭐️ [UIMA-6480] Add tests with empty arrays to CAS de/ser-suite</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Refactoring</strong></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\">tzdata</a> release since 2021b.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/72\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/72</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The prebuilt WinARM64 binaries below should be considered alpha/experimental.</em></p>\n<h2>ICU 72rc with CLDR beta3 / tzdata2022d</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/72\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/72</a></p>\n<h2>ICU 72 RC</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release candidate for Unicode® ICU 72. It updates to <a href=\"https://blog.unicode.org/2022/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-150.html\">Unicode 15</a>, and to <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-42\">CLDR 42</a> locale data with various additions and corrections.</p>\n<p>ICU 72 adds technology preview implementations for person name formatting, as well as for a new version of message formatting based on a proposed draft Unicode specification.</p>\n<p>ICU 72 and CLDR 42 are major releases, including a new version of Unicode and major locale data improvements.</p>\n<p>ICU 72 updates to the time zone data version 2022b (2022-aug) which is effectively the same as 2022c. Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream<a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\"> tzdata</a> release since 2021b.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/72\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/72</a>.</p>\n<p>Please test this release candidate on your platforms and report bugs and regressions by Tuesday, 2022-oct-18, via the <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/contacts\">icu-support</a> mailing list, and/or please <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/bugs\">find/submit error reports</a>.</p>\n<p>Please do not use this release candidate in production.</p>\n<p>The preliminary API reference documents are published on <a href=\"https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/\">unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/</a> – follow the “Dev” links there.</p>\n<h2>ICU 71.1</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 71.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 updates to <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-41\">CLDR 41</a> locale data with various additions and corrections.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 adds phrase-based line breaking for Japanese. Existing line breaking methods follow standards and conventions for body text but do not work well for short Japanese text, such as in titles and headings. This new feature is optimized for these use cases.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 adds support for Hindi written in Latin letters (<code>hi_Latn</code>). The CLDR data for this increasingly popular locale has been significantly revised and expanded. Note that based on user expectations, hi_Latn incorporates a large amount of English, and can also be referred to as “Hinglish”.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 and CLDR 41 are minor releases, mostly focused on bug fixes and small enhancements. (The fall CLDR/ICU releases will update to Unicode 15 which is planned for September.) We are also working to re-establish continuous performance testing for ICU, and on development towards future versions.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 updates to the time zone data version 2022a. Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\">tzdata</a> release since 2021b.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/71\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/71</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/releases\">testcontainers's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.17.4</h2>\n<h1>What's Changed</h1>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<p>This release has been made possible through the efforts of whopping 23 contributors, wow! 🤯</p>\n<p>Besides 3 new modules, this release brings a couple of bugfixes, improved compatibility and resilience in certain scenarios, better defaults and more configurability.</p>\n<p>You might also notice many PRs related to the documentation, templates for PRs and issues, and automation regarding OSS contributions. Testcontainers has always been a project with a lot of involvement by the community and we are very proud of this. That’s why want to make contributing to Testcontainers a great experience, no matter if you raise an issue, submit a PR or initiate a discussion in GitHhub Discussions.</p>\n<h3>🐼 New Module: Redpanda (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5740\">#5740</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/eddumelendez\"><code>@​eddumelendez</code></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://redpanda.com/\">Redpanda</a>, a Kafka-compatible streaming platform, recently added a special <code>dev-container</code> mode to their container image, that allows even faster startup times. A great reason to work in a Testcontainers module that leverages this flag by default to give you a great integration testing experience when using Redpanda. And of course, using Redpanda with Testcontainers is as easy and convenient as you are used to:</p>\n<pre><code>var container = new RedpandaContainer(&quot;docker.redpanda.com/vectorized/redpanda:v22.2.1&quot;)\ncontainer.start()\nvar connectionUrl = container.getBootstrapServers()\n// use the connectionUrl and start testing!\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can check out the <a href=\"https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/redpanda/\">docs</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h3>New Module: TiDB (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5511\">#5511</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/Icemap\"><code>@​Icemap</code></a></h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview\">TiDB</a>, we are adding support for a new database module. As with other databases that can be accessed via JDBC, you can leverage Testcontainers’ special JDBC URL integration:</p>\n<pre><code>jdbc:tc:tidb:v6.1.0:///databasename\n</code></pre>\n<h3>New Module: Hashicorp Consul (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4683\">#4683</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/julb\"><code>@​julb</code></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.consul.io/\">Consul</a></p>\n<h2>🚀 Features &amp; Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>getContainerByServiceName should work without suffix (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5776\">#5776</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/REslim30\"><code>@​REslim30</code></a></li>\n<li>Allow Pulsar default WaitStrategy to honour startup timeout (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5674\">#5674</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/nahguam\"><code>@​nahguam</code></a></li>\n<li>fix: ContainerDatabaseDriver does not register Properties object (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5829\">#5829</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/REslim30\"><code>@​REslim30</code></a></li>\n<li>couchbase: allow to configure bucket replicas and default to 0.

Testcontainers has always been a project with a lot of involvement by the community and we are very proud of this. That’s why want to make contributing to Testcontainers a great experience, no matter if you raise an issue, submit a PR or initiate a discussion in GitHhub Discussions.</p>\n<h3>🐼 New Module: Redpanda (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5740\">#5740</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/eddumelendez\"><code>@​eddumelendez</code></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://redpanda.com/\">Redpanda</a>, a Kafka-compatible streaming platform, recently added a special <code>dev-container</code> mode to their container image, that allows even faster startup times. A great reason to work in a Testcontainers module that leverages this flag by default to give you a great integration testing experience when using Redpanda. And of course, using Redpanda with Testcontainers is as easy and convenient as you are used to:</p>\n<pre><code>var container = new RedpandaContainer(&quot;docker.redpanda.com/vectorized/redpanda:v22.2.1&quot;)\ncontainer.start()\nvar connectionUrl = container.getBootstrapServers()\n// use the connectionUrl and start testing!\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can check out the <a href=\"https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/redpanda/\">docs</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h3>New Module: TiDB (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5511\">#5511</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/Icemap\"><code>@​Icemap</code></a></h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview\">TiDB</a>, we are adding support for a new database module. As with other databases that can be accessed via JDBC, you can leverage Testcontainers’ special JDBC URL integration:</p>\n<pre><code>jdbc:tc:tidb:v6.1.0:///databasename\n</code></pre>\n<h3>New Module: Hashicorp Consul (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4683\">#4683</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/julb\"><code>@​julb</code></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.consul.io/\">Consul</a></p>\n<h2>🚀 Features &amp; Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>getContainerByServiceName should work without suffix (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5776\">#5776</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/REslim30\"><code>@​REslim30</code></a></li>\n<li>Allow Pulsar default WaitStrategy to honour startup timeout (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5674\">#5674</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/nahguam\"><code>@​nahguam</code></a></li>\n<li>fix: ContainerDatabaseDriver does not register Properties object (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5829\">#5829</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/REslim30\"><code>@​REslim30</code></a></li>\n<li>couchbase: allow to configure bucket replicas and default to 0.
