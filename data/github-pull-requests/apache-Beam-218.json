Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

is an **experimental** feature, to add options `withTrigger(Trigger)`, `withAccumulationMode(AccumulationMode)` and `.withAllowedLatency(Duration)`, so developers can specify their own aggregation

SUM(f_intValue) AS `sum` FROM PCOLLECTION GROUP BY f_intGroupingKey, TUMBLE(f_timestamp, INTERVAL '1' HOUR)\";\r\n\r\nPCollection<Row> result = input.apply(\"sql\", BeamSql.query(sql));\r\n```\r\n2. remove window keywords in the query and specify window/trigger behavior as below:\r\n```\r\nPCollection<Row> input =...\r\n            .apply(Window\r\n

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ X ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ X ] How it does it\r\n   - [ X ] Why this approach\r\n - [ X ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically. (ran python tests instead)\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

is the last PR for [BEAM-2728] issue.\r\nThe last sketch uses AddThis' StreamSummary sketch implementation, which presents many defects for distributed processing (such as loss of information during merging...). \r\nThat's why I will try to update this sketch as soon as possible with a better implementation.\r\n\r\nThe MostFrequent class contains several components, so I think it will be clearer to present them here:\r\n1. Default PTransforms that are AutoValue classes like for previous sektches\r\n2. A parent Combine class MostFrequentFn with two childs **SerializableElements** and **NonSerializableElements** to distinguish the two cases, because StreamSummary needs to receive serializable elements\r\n3. An **ElementWrapper** in order to wrap non serializable elements into a serializable one using the Coder\r\n4. A **StreamSummarySketch** which inherits from StreamSummary in order to implement the \"equals()\" method.\r\n5. **RetrieveTopK** utility class which Contains DoFn for retrieving the top k most frequent elements from a PCollection of StreamSummarySketches. It avoid users to pull stream-lib dependencies for retrieving the top K elements.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

PR adds jenkins jobs for HadoopInputFormatIOIT. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR there was only one test that used postgres kubernetes scripts (JDBC IOIT). Right now, while having more than one test using those, there is a strong possiblility that two tests will try to create kubernetes resources (eg. service or replication controller) of the same name (say, \"postgres\"). This will result in one test being unable to run successfully (due to names collision). \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a solution to above problem. Every kubernetes test resource is being created in it's own namespace. This avoids the name collisions and allows running them \"in isolation\". \r\n\r\nThis solution has some other (minor) advantages: \r\n - if a Jenkins job gets killed and doesn't clean up it's Kubernetes resources on the cluster we don't have to manually delete them to be able to run other test (now the test fails due to name collisions with the \"dangling\" resources that are left there)\r\n - we can easily clean up the cluster with one command. To delete every resource (service, rc, pods etc) it's sufficient to delete the namespace only (`kubectl delete namespace foo`) it deletes it's \"inner resources\" too. \r\n\r\nRemarks: \r\n - Port collisions are still possible even when using namespaces. If two services from different namespaces want bind to the same port we get an error from Kubernetes (\"port is already allocated\"). This doesn't happen while using load balancer service so it's not a problem for our IOIT tests now.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

potential integration test failure when using TestPipeline.convertToArgs if type of the option is List or more complex structure.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing the converToArgs function with more magic, we probably want to get this step removed from integration test to make testing clean, understandable and more clear. This results in refactoring few example pipelines. \r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this solution is that matchers (like OnSuccessMatcher and OnCreateMatcher) for test output verification will no longer be serialized and deserialized during life cycle of test. This can avoid potential serialization problem which is easily hidden under test passing signal.\r\n\r\nChanges includes:\r\n- In the example pipelines, extract `pipeline` related code to single function.\r\n- Remove `TestPipeline.convertToArgs` from all integration test. Instead, pass `options` to pipeline code directly.\r\n- Fix WordCountIT and WindowedWordCountIT to use NumberedShardedFiles in a correct way. The error is hidden since previously OnSuccessMatcher was not serialized correctly.\r\n\r\nAffected ITs:\r\n- `WordCountIT`\r\n- `WindowedWordCountIT`\r\n- `DebuggingWordCountTest`\r\n- `BigqueryTornadoesIT`\r\n- `WordCountTest` (for Apex runner)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-26T20:47:05Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T00:51:28Z","closed_at":"2018-04-16T22:50:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5f372f1bef77b3c0bfa001db760aa242dce455e","assignee":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4751/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4751/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4751/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/da879be8b9d4664aa34a4883032eed90aed70c98","head":{"label":"bsidhom:docker-manager","ref":"docker-manager","sha":"da879be8b9d4664aa34a4883032eed90aed70c98","user":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110900797,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA5MDA3OTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"bsidhom/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [X] Why it does it\r\n   - [X] How it does it\r\n   - [X] Why this approach\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-24T00:51:49Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T20:25:54Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T20:14:32Z","merged_at":"2018-03-08T20:14:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3468b694fcef8fbed9cba669bbb56a5cc475a30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/0eed8bc06fd0327af03bd07e944a099a46060404","head":{"label":"apilloud:nexmark-models","ref":"nexmark-models","sha":"0eed8bc06fd0327af03bd07e944a099a46060404","user":{"login":"apilloud","id":5972627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud","html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119748403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3NDg0MDM=","name":"beam","full_name":"apilloud/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apilloud","id":5972627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud","html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud/beam","description":"Apache

the progress in this PR\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

jars are for shipping tests (so you can, e.g. run them in a different place) but we use them incorrectly in a couple places for shipping libraries or resources. (We use them in a more-or-less acceptable way for `ValidatesRunner` tests and `standard_coders.yaml` test cases. But still, this does not work very well with tools because it isn't common or intended.)\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates a bunch of (a) putting library code in test jars and (b) dependencies on said test jars.\r\n\r\nDeps not eliminated:\r\n\r\n - external projects, as I don't know the background\r\n - `beam-runners-core-java` has abstract `StateInternalsTest` where runners extend it and provide `stateInternals()`. This is actually a problem waiting to happen because if it actually had any test scoped deps they would be get pulled in. Better would be a `StateInternalsTester` in the main jar or a testing utility, but then it wouldn't have the nice breakdown into JUnit test methods. I'm not sure that JUnit has any real way of making reusable tests like this.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

I fixed the paths and removed version property from places where it's not needed (child poms will derive the parent's dependency version).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

HERE\r\n\r\nFor local runners the classloading hierarchy needs to handle parent correctly.\r\nThis PR ensures the proxy lookup is able to handle the parent for that case.\r\nA better but way more impacting fix can be to serialize the PO each time even for local runners - kind of pass by value pattern.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

problem here was caused by unfortunate timing during watermark retrieval. KinesisReader uses [MovingFunction](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/util/MovingFunction.java) to decide if watermark should be advanced or not, parametrized with `numSignificantBuckets=2` and `numSignificantSamples=10`. The test relied only on `numSignificantSamples` and did not take into consideration the time buckets. Now it sets the system time to a fixed value before execution so there will be no unfortunate time interatctions. I've also applied the same changes to other test that was likely to fail as it followed the same scheme. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [X] Why it does it\r\n   - [X] How it does it\r\n   - [X] Why this approach\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nMy previous Python 3 compatibility PR converted cStringIO.StringIO to io.StringIO.

PR removes the now deprecated [DoFnTester](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/DoFnTester.java) from the MongoDbIO test suite. All MongoDbIO tests now use [TestPipeline](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/testing/TestPipeline.java).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** I was wondering if it was necessary in `testWriteEmptyCollection()` to check that the _empty_ collection is in fact empty in the Mongo instance? To be consistent, I referenced other tests and using the Mongo client to ensure correctness was common place (ex: `testWrite()`). For `testWriteEmptyCollection()`, we want to: _make sure the empty collection is still empty after attempting to write to it._ But really, don't we just want to make sure nothing blows up when providing `MongoDbIO.write()` with empty input? So should we just check for a runtime exception? \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

is already more-or-less the same idea s `PTransform.expand`, except it also takes a `SqlEnv`. So this refactor just separates the \"get an env\" part from the \"expand as a transform\" part. It does it in a very lazy manner by just making a non-static inner class.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do going forward is audit what these look like in a UI, to make it so that the layers of the unfolded PTransform are readable and have good `DisplayData`.\r\n\r\nOut of laziness, when the format got wacky I just used autoformat. If we apply it to the whole module (it was applied to most of Beam when we switched to Java 8) then the diffs will become smaller here.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-17T01:14:59Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T21:39:29Z","closed_at":"2018-02-21T21:39:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"170396446538738fb3375c7f7dbab6d0f32ca835","assignee":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9480c67287938c25f27ebcd017742cf11553aabb","head":{"label":"tgroh:stateful_root","ref":"stateful_root","sha":"9480c67287938c25f27ebcd017742cf11553aabb","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

the `maven-publish` plugin to publish java artifacts. The old `maven` plugin does not allow classifiers to be stripped from published artifacts. Since we want to export shaded jars but do not want the `shaded` classifier appended, we need to manually strip this.\r\n\r\nThis change additionally sets project groups and allows subprojects to register artifact ids. Artifacts can be published to the local maven repository for testing via `publishToMavenLocal`. This is equivalent to `mvn install`.\r\n\r\nI was unable to find mappings between all gradle project names and maven artifacts, so I've only included a few here.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-16T23:52:23Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T04:59:57Z","closed_at":"2018-02-21T04:59:57Z","merged_at":"2018-02-21T04:59:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3a6ca043abd41fbcbbbfc91449aabcec0ff1df3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/85247b4d7835ad544455b2e3595ed0286b8a5732","head":{"label":"bsidhom:gradle-publish","ref":"gradle-publish","sha":"85247b4d7835ad544455b2e3595ed0286b8a5732","user":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110900797,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA5MDA3OTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"bsidhom/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [n/a] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

This feature only works for the direct runner at the moment. Before this PR, the output timestamp of event timers are set to timer's delivery timestamp. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nWhen an user sets timer with output timestamp 3 and delivery timestamp 5:\r\n\r\n@ProcessElement()\r\npublic void processElement(ProcessContext c, @TimerId(\"foo\") Timer timer) {\r\n  timer.withOutputTimestamp(new Instant(3)).set(new Instant(5));\r\n}\r\n\r\n@OnTimer(\"foo\")\r\npublic void myTimerCallback(OnTimerContext c, BoundedWindow w) {\r\n   c.output(\"some_value\"); // outputs with timestamp 3.\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe timer will deliver at 5 as usual. However, output() method of the OnTimerContext in myTimerCallback function uses 3 as the output timestamp. To make sure the element is not late for further transforms down the pipeline, output watermark will be held at the output timestamp of the timer (3 in the example) until myTimerCallback executes.\r\n\r\nThis WM hold feature is also useful for outputting values saved in state cells right before garbage collection. (BEAM-1589) GC timer fires after the window expiration, therefore, outputting elements with output timestamp past the window expiration results them to be dropped further down the pipeline. By setting onWindowExpiration timer as:\r\ntimer.withOutputTimestamp(windowExpiration).set(GCtime), we could output these elements inside the window.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).
