Delete zk node when invoke ReferenceConfig.destory() which consumer uses ZookeeperRegistry.\r\n2. Remove ConcurrentMap<NotifyListener, ChildListener> in zkListeners if the map is empty(release the memory).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n**1. How to verify zookeeper node?** \r\nPrepare: \r\n- Startup a zookeeper application.\r\n- Create an simple dubbo provider in an application, use zookeeper registry.\r\n- Create an simple dubbo consumer in another application, use zookeeper registry.\r\n- Startup dubbo-admin to monitor provider and consumer node. \r\n\r\nBefore using this commit:\r\n1. Create a ReferenceConfig with GenericService in consumer application and use the GenericService to  invoke any method of the provider.\r\n2. Use any browser to open dubbo-admin page and switch to \"consumer\" tab, you can see there is a consumer data.\r\n3. Invoke  ReferenceConfig#destroy() method, then flush page of dubbo-admin.\r\n4. You can see the consumer data still exist (because zk node still exist).\r\n\r\nAfter using this commit:\r\nDo same operations 1, 2 and 3 above.\r\n4. You can see the consumer data is removed (zk node is removed.).\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. How to verify zkListener?**\r\nThere is a JUnit Test to verify zkListener","created_at":"2018-07-29T09:51:09Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T08:14:57Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T08:14:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65a4a6a1ed3c9618640f5bae29827855d2e5fde7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2efa39097c487dedb8d00e608ba3274b829b6b3c","head":{"label":"solid210:fix-478","ref":"fix-478","sha":"2efa39097c487dedb8d00e608ba3274b829b6b3c","user":{"login":"solid210","id":9332075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMzIwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9332075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210","html_url":"https://github.com/solid210","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142577795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDI1Nzc3OTU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"solid210/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"solid210","id":9332075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMzIwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9332075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210","html_url":"https://github.com/solid210","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solid210/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/solid210/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-26T14:35:28Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T17:15:53Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T17:15:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c1546b3b55136d9ac58b95e96984deb33a394ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/279aa7711cd0fe44e8f679049a1541f5921c04e9","head":{"label":"a13237009879:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"279aa7711cd0fe44e8f679049a1541f5921c04e9","user":{"login":"a13237009879","id":18167417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTY3NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18167417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879","html_url":"https://github.com/a13237009879","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142451381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDI0NTEzODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"a13237009879/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a13237009879","id":18167417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTY3NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18167417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879","html_url":"https://github.com/a13237009879","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a13237009879/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a13237009879/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nadd testcase\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nadd testcase\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

To enable it, you need to either: 1) remove listener class ContextLoaderListener in your web.xml 2) change listener class to DubboContextLoaderListener in your web.xml \r\n\r\n2. listener class DubboContextLoaderListener is defined in web.xml This is automatically enable Dubbo's elegant shutdown feature, even for a servlet container which is not 3.0 compatible \r\n\r\n3. no listener class defined in web.xml Dubbo's elegant shutdown feature will be automatically enabled if Dubbo is running under a servlet 3.0+ compatible container see DubboWebApplicationInitializer for more details.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun and test the above 3 cases.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-24T08:24:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T14:54:19Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T01:44:57Z","merged_at":"2018-07-26T01:44:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d9ba1a5372b58ce3e5eb214b48a8c06755f912a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3cc52c8ce7eef86c93b9d67437f25b622af5c0a7","head":{"label":"ralf0131:elegant-shutdown-compatibility","ref":"elegant-shutdown-compatibility","sha":"3cc52c8ce7eef86c93b9d67437f25b622af5c0a7","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T10:31:15Z","updated_at":"2018-09-30T02:30:54Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T02:22:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f9473655fca9dfab954fb27d77c89e8c5f4f894","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9a4bd0196b6fe9f0a4933f8efa163d17a528d8da","head":{"label":"cvictory:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"9a4bd0196b6fe9f0a4933f8efa163d17a528d8da","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T07:12:48Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T12:50:54Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T12:50:54Z","merged_at":"2018-07-23T12:50:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b6e6f3a375d82aab1a1f17b034e666c63f61103","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f3e817d0027e5336fb5dbed50d9c6ead591c4abe","head":{"label":"diecui1202:fix-version-master","ref":"fix-version-master","sha":"f3e817d0027e5336fb5dbed50d9c6ead591c4abe","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T07:10:47Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T12:50:16Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T12:50:16Z","merged_at":"2018-07-23T12:50:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1ca37db71239620dd07a6573d4091df955c57d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e615239606dd452db5b816e23941dc506377b467","head":{"label":"diecui1202:fix-version","ref":"fix-version","sha":"e615239606dd452db5b816e23941dc506377b467","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the error \"Element linkXRef is not allowed here\" reported by Intellij IDEA  2018.1.6 (Utimate Edition).\r\n\r\nThe  linkXRef element isn't defined as parameter in the \"check\" goal but in the \"checkstyle\" goal and the \"checkstyle-aggregate\" goal,  according to the plugin.xml of  maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.0.0.\r\n\r\n See https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/plugin-info.html  for details.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRemove the  linkXRef element in root pom.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCI passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-20T09:35:16Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T02:39:58Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T02:39:58Z","merged_at":"2018-07-23T02:39:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ec30bfd822283e2262cd8eded525736d6a62920","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c4318f6f04ba4df660efb32ae6cf8749c0b16111","head":{"label":"lsqeric:master","ref":"master","sha":"c4318f6f04ba4df660efb32ae6cf8749c0b16111","user":{"login":"lsqeric","id":36093011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDkzMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36093011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric","html_url":"https://github.com/lsqeric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141682557,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE2ODI1NTc=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"lsqeric/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lsqeric","id":36093011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDkzMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36093011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric","html_url":"https://github.com/lsqeric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsqeric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lsqeric/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-17T05:23:20Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T05:24:19Z","closed_at":"2018-07-17T05:24:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/00bad2e89b5e501eb39b1d58c334c127a7303642","head":{"label":"apache:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"00bad2e89b5e501eb39b1d58c334c127a7303642","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-07-16T10:34:50Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T13:59:49Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T13:59:40Z","merged_at":"2018-07-16T13:59:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"8116b102d59c6993dd757a9dc2222da040136816","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/314816d3465b1b5102ce21845241549c8278d368","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue2072","ref":"issue2072","sha":"314816d3465b1b5102ce21845241549c8278d368","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cd68437f67ed8cb7a1a0dccd49fb3266d4042220","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-15T02:39:37Z","updated_at":"2018-07-15T07:06:12Z","closed_at":"2018-07-15T07:06:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8021bb0a8cccbf9c1d383a2cfc2aac872f463ffa","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"8021bb0a8cccbf9c1d383a2cfc2aac872f463ffa","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-14T09:02:21Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T09:42:59Z","closed_at":"2018-08-02T10:01:55Z","merged_at":"2018-08-02T10:01:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"413a2a0288d0b0800234132aff9f7c5f3803b633","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fef30cc9348aff87cf3cc1f501a0991e94d1a453","head":{"label":"ralf0131:ipv6-support","ref":"ipv6-support","sha":"fef30cc9348aff87cf3cc1f501a0991e94d1a453","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-07-12T11:21:21Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T12:52:57Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T12:52:47Z","merged_at":"2018-07-12T12:52:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"32b7c17d9ca001d4a35cc47b6626215808de0130","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2071/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2071/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2071/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/40f57cb66f37c9c02fdaa099e5c19c58e4195528","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue2063","ref":"issue2063","sha":"40f57cb66f37c9c02fdaa099e5c19c58e4195528","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c6880b23551e81c2c4b11b925002ff669cf65f7a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

No need to do another recursive call, which will cause infinite recursion.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCheck the newly added unit test case: Hessian2WriteReplaceTest.java\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-05T04:16:01Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T03:14:01Z","closed_at":"2018-07-13T03:11:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8586d46b4aa6f892fc45c07c08854cdc033fc6fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17/labels","id":3285726,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI4NTcyNg==","number":17,"title":"2.6.3","description":"A

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-29T04:37:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T07:30:32Z","closed_at":"2018-07-09T07:30:32Z","merged_at":"2018-07-09T07:30:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2df156b9c8997a7fcffe748b63b55495484c803","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dea9457b2017850bd9d9e1398ba3bf667bb8fce6","head":{"label":"chickenlj:maven-parent-to-apache","ref":"maven-parent-to-apache","sha":"dea9457b2017850bd9d9e1398ba3bf667bb8fce6","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed a bug described in [Dubbo-1765](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/1765)\r\n\r\nIf the provider is temporarily unavailable, the reference bean initialization will failed with exception. However, the initialized flag will be set to true, which will cause spring to hold a NULL_OBJECT cache. The subsequent call will always get a null instance.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow the consumer to obtain the correct instance when provider become available.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Set initialized=false in ReferenceConfig when provider is not available.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nunit test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-27T07:09:42Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T06:16:33Z","closed_at":"2018-06-29T06:16:33Z","merged_at":"2018-06-29T06:16:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2710393e01973bcdc549192e0d25a80272ccc27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"qinliujie","id":8599441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8599441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie","html_url":"https://github.com/qinliujie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2c734929ee7d4c408ebca88007bb77f3003082d9","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:fix_netty4_heartbeat","ref":"fix_netty4_heartbeat","sha":"2c734929ee7d4c408ebca88007bb77f3003082d9","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed a bug described in [Dubbo-1765](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/1765)\r\n\r\nIf the provider is temporarily unavailable, the reference bean initialization will failed with exception. However, the initialized flag will be set to true, which will cause spring to hold a NULL_OBJECT cache. The subsequent call will always get a null instance.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow the consumer to obtain the correct instance when provider become available.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Set initialized=false in ReferenceConfig when provider is not available.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nunit test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-26T06:34:12Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T07:24:05Z","closed_at":"2018-06-27T07:24:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5084f26694df25a322358afe7c9d54a2a8e02ef1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/697fd4f9311c3ba386111fce8df212b43bbe32ef","head":{"label":"ATAKing1023:master","ref":"master","sha":"697fd4f9311c3ba386111fce8df212b43bbe32ef","user":{"login":"ATAKing1023","id":26701496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzAxNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26701496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023","html_url":"https://github.com/ATAKing1023","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ATAKing1023/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7a48fac84b14ac6a21c1bdfc5958705dd8dda84d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nRedisProtocol.java\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-26T02:04:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T02:17:51Z","closed_at":"2018-06-26T03:05:49Z","merged_at":"2018-06-26T03:05:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a48fac84b14ac6a21c1bdfc5958705dd8dda84d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1987/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1987/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1987/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/13b233f775d898bd8588e0b60d277d9a0e20865d","head":{"label":"ningyu1:fix-jedis","ref":"fix-jedis","sha":"13b233f775d898bd8588e0b60d277d9a0e20865d","user":{"login":"ningyu1","id":3387548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODc1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3387548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1","html_url":"https://github.com/ningyu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130331552,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzAzMzE1NTI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"ningyu1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ningyu1","id":3387548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODc1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3387548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1","html_url":"https://github.com/ningyu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ningyu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ningyu1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-25T09:59:43Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T11:53:15Z","closed_at":"2018-06-25T11:53:12Z","merged_at":"2018-06-25T11:53:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"eee0be393926d87055d62b7fbeb288451b3c32c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9159be22924dd3b9f39b01046e855eb87c6413aa","head":{"label":"beiwei30:qos-unit-test","ref":"qos-unit-test","sha":"9159be22924dd3b9f39b01046e855eb87c6413aa","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f186f2bc167f151dc15e025c03cca6da8c11c464","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-21T07:58:55Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T08:14:33Z","closed_at":"2018-06-21T08:14:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4b420702fe65847411db4934feffb1d942be3dbc","head":{"label":"wayneliu91:master","ref":"master","sha":"4b420702fe65847411db4934feffb1d942be3dbc","user":{"login":"wayneliu91","id":20139931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTM5OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20139931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91","html_url":"https://github.com/wayneliu91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wayneliu91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"705bf37cbb039f718e3b98718511526dfd2efd64","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nEnhancements for the new async way of Dubbo introduced in #1876. Below is the main issues this PR trys to solve:\r\n\r\n- Support service signature with original CompletableFuture returntype.\r\n```java      \r\n      public interface DemoService {\r\n          CompletableFuture<String> sayHello(String name);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n- Provide context restore API when switching threads.\r\n```java\r\n      AsyncContext.signalContextSwitch();\r\n```\r\n- Postprocess of async result in filter chain.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Add AsyncRpcResult to represent result value of async invoke, equivalent to RpcResult for sync invoke.\r\n\r\n- Add PostProcessFilter to support postprocess of result in filter chain\r\n- Change AbstractProxyInvoker and DubboInvoker to support services with original Future signature, supplementary for generated Future service.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- Run samples for how to use async in a new way.\r\n    - [dubbo-samples-async-original-future](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-samples/tree/samples-for-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT/dubbo-samples-async-original-future)\r\n    - [dubbo-samples-async](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-samples/tree/samples-for-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT/dubbo-samples-async)\r\n    - [dubbo-samples-async-generated-future](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-samples/tree/samples-for-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT/dubbo-samples-async-generated-future)\r\n    - [dubbo-samples-async-provider](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-samples/tree/samples-for-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT/dubbo-samples-async-provider)\r\n- Still lack of UT, expect to add soon.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [X] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-18T15:24:37Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T01:54:45Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T01:54:44Z","merged_at":"2018-07-11T01:54:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"b055991b317f4e58d256721875a00c52fe415510","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/18","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/18","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/18/labels","id":3481802,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzQ4MTgwMg==","number":18,"title":"2.7.0","description":"An

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

elements (dubbo)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-15T09:52:23Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T07:56:26Z","closed_at":"2018-06-19T05:59:33Z","merged_at":"2018-06-19T05:59:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"99a01d5709b9b11b708101243bbb7293cf780f0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3943b44f18d02380b075fa4bffbce778011400f8","head":{"label":"ulinkwo:enhancing-ide-support","ref":"enhancing-ide-support","sha":"3943b44f18d02380b075fa4bffbce778011400f8","user":{"login":"ulinkwo","id":45244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo","html_url":"https://github.com/ulinkwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136700666,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY3MDA2NjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ulinkwo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulinkwo","id":45244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo","html_url":"https://github.com/ulinkwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulinkwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulinkwo/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd compatible module and rename groupId to org.apache.dubbo\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add single module named \"dubbo-compatible\", and support limited old extension, such Filter.\r\n2. rename groupId to org.apache.dubbo\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll unit cases are pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-15T08:45:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T10:20:58Z","closed_at":"2018-06-19T03:31:10Z","merged_at":"2018-06-19T03:31:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0ca0422538187190f7c52f33f87cece4c0d657c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5075229e5d15a56794dc0566e3a1654620c95d95","head":{"label":"diecui1202:add-compatible-module","ref":"add-compatible-module","sha":"5075229e5d15a56794dc0566e3a1654620c95d95","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.
