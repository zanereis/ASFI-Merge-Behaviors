What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is kind of a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14482 . As we put `CatalogTable` in the logical plan directly, it makes sense to let physical plans take `CatalogTable` directly, instead of extracting some fields of `CatalogTable` in planner and then construct a new `CatalogTable` in physical plan.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is the first step to remove `HiveClient` from `HiveSessionState`. In the metastore interaction, we always use the fully qualified table name when accessing/operating a table. That means, we always specify the database. Thus, it is not necessary to use `HiveClient` to change the active database in Hive metastore. \n\nIn `HiveSessionCatalog`, `setCurrentDatabase` is the only function that uses `HiveClient`. Thus, we can remove it after removing `setCurrentDatabase`\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T01:02:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T18:21:22Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T18:21:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe20a2141c815474dbddd18f8398a8e89e4fd664","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c9a1e3c608be72ca7c4203ecc0e80f15080eb80","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:setCurrentDB","ref":"setCurrentDB","sha":"1c9a1e3c608be72ca7c4203ecc0e80f15080eb80","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds parser support for `BigDecimal` literals. If you append the suffix `BD` to a valid number then this will be interpreted as a `BigDecimal`, for example `12.0E10BD` will interpreted into a BigDecimal with scale -9 and precision 3. This is useful in situations where you need exact values.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to `ExpressionParserSuite`, `ExpressionSQLBuilderSuite` and `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-25T23:47:18Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T20:31:40Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T20:31:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85e7257dccb1b1d5618283acd24bffa33eee1697","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e889a25b165be7fa8afdd105866e4b305016b4c9","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17246","ref":"SPARK-17246","sha":"e889a25b165be7fa8afdd105866e4b305016b4c9","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRight now, we rely on Hive's `SessionState.get()` to retrieve the HiveConf used by ClientWrapper. However, this conf is actually the HiveConf set with the `state`. There is a small chance that we are trying to use the Hive client in a new thread while the global client has not been created yet. In this case, `SessionState.get()` will return a `null`, which causes a NPE when we call `SessionState.get(). getConf`. Since the conf that we want is actually the conf we set to `state`. I am changing the code to just call `state.getConf` (this is also what Spark 2.0 does).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have not figured out a good way to reproduce this.\n","created_at":"2016-08-25T22:08:42Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T03:59:04Z","closed_at":"2016-09-08T03:59:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b0ef10080fdb4e26654f0f629c948349c85d12f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b57886c0489c759f0308a7b104f5b058204cdcd","head":{"label":"yhuai:SPARK-17245","ref":"SPARK-17245","sha":"8b57886c0489c759f0308a7b104f5b058204cdcd","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-1.6","ref":"branch-1.6","sha":"412b0e8969215411b97efd3d0984dc6cac5d31e0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPreviously we have 2 conditions to decide whether a data source table is hive-compatible:\n1. the data source is file-based and has a corresponding Hive serde\n2. have a `path` entry in data source options/storage properties\n\nHowever, if condition 1 is true, condition 2 must be true too, as we will put the default table path into data source options/storage properties for managed data source tables.\n\nThere is also a potential issue: we will set the `locationUri` even for managed table.\n\nThis PR removes the condition 2 and only set the `locationUri` for external data source tables.\n\nNote: this is also a first step to unify the `path` of data source tables and `locationUri` of hive serde tables. For hive serde tables, `locationUri` is only set for external table. For data source tables, `path` is always set. We can make them consistent after this PR.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRemove double quotes in 3 cmd files in spark/bin to avoid cutting off argument that has special characters and double quoted.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJust copy and paste following command then execute it in **spark/bin**\n`spark-submit.cmd --jars just-to-start \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lzdb?user=guest&password=abc123\" my_table`\n\nIt will not even be started, the argument of mysql connection string was cut off :\n\n```\nbin\\spark-submit2.cmd\" --jars just-to-start \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lzdb?user' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n'password' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n```\n\nThis's a conservative fix that keeps the rules of using cmd /V /E /C and will work as it's able to work.\n\nIt's not a best idea to use /V /E to avoid polluting environment and enable /V /E /C , this will restrain the argument passing.\n(1) Cannot start XXX.cmd itself if it's full path has white spaces even if quoted :\n`cmd /V /E /C \"%~dp0XXX.cmd\" xxx \"%~dp0XXX.cmd\" xxx`\n(2) Cannot pass double quoted arguments to spark-submit.cmd (as mentioned above) under : \n`cmd /V /E /C`\nMay be it's better to force set the variables that need to avoid pollution, since it's difficult to require the users to keep using \"SetLocal EnableDelayedExpansion\" alike in the batch files (_.cmd/_.bat).\nBy the way, I didn't change the pyspark , R, beeline etc. scripts because they seems work fine for long.\n### What's more in addition\n\nA tool to fast **change/restore** the files in spark/bin if you like : https://github.com/qualiu/lzmw\n- Remove quotes (delete the --nf xxx will modify all matched files): <br>\n  `lzmw -i -t \"(^cmd.*?/[VCE])\\s+\\\"+(%~dp0\\S+\\.cmd)\\\"+\" -o \"$1 $2\" --nf \"pyspark|sparkR|beeline|example\" -p . -R`\n- Add/Restore quotes  :\n  `lzmw -it \"\\\"*(%~dp0\\S+\\.cmd)\\\"*\" -o \"\\\"$1\\\"\" -p . -R`\n- Or remove the head :\n  `lzmw -f \"\\.cmd$\" -it \"^cmd /V /E /C \" -o \"\" -p %CD%

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds a purge interface to MetadataLog, and an implementation in HDFSMetadataLog. The purge function is currently unused, but I will use it to purge old execution and file source logs in follow-up patches. These changes are required in a production structured streaming job that runs for a long period of time.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a unit test case in HDFSMetadataLogSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-08-25T07:14:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T23:07:46Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T23:07:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4e88acb6f02ffcb1bc2ee44ea17442effe32098","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d9d1e6d59fb68996bf96b5238835a0718a8da1a","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-17235","ref":"SPARK-17235","sha":"0d9d1e6d59fb68996bf96b5238835a0718a8da1a","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHive Index tables are not supported by Spark SQL. Thus, we issue an exception when users try to access Hive Index tables. When the internal function `tableExists` tries to access Hive Index tables, it always gets the same error message: `Hive index table is not supported`. This message could be confusing to users, since their SQL operations could be completely unrelated to Hive Index tables. For example, when users try to alter a table to a new name and there exists an index table with the same name, the expected exception should be a `TableAlreadyExistsException`.\n\nThis PR made the following changes:\n- Introduced a new `AnalysisException` type: `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. When users try to access an `Index Table`, we will issue a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`.\n- `tableExists` returns `true` when hitting a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` and the feature is `Hive index table`.\n- Add a checking `requireTableNotExists` for `SessionCatalog`'s `createTable` API; otherwise, the current implementation relies on the Hive's internal checking.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case\n","created_at":"2016-08-25T07:13:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-26T22:59:39Z","closed_at":"2016-08-30T09:29:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3788ae2b52d6d11f5754d3c524818e139b814f7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/439db0bb86179d376874c83e89f7cf3981fb1b6a","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:tableExists","ref":"tableExists","sha":"439db0bb86179d376874c83e89f7cf3981fb1b6a","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

PR addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17231)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhile debugging the performance of a large GraphX connected components computation, we found several places in the `network-common` and `network-shuffle` code bases where trace or debug log messages are constructed even if the respective log level is disabled. According to YourKit, these constructions were creating substantial churn in the eden region. Refactoring the respective code to avoid these unnecessary constructions except where necessary led to a modest but measurable reduction in our job's task time, GC time and the ratio thereof.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWe computed the connected components of a graph with about 2.6 billion vertices and 1.7 billion edges four times. We used four different EC2 clusters each with 8 r3.8xl worker nodes. Two test runs used Spark master. Two used Spark master + this PR. The results from the first test run, master and master+PR:\n![master](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/833693/17951634/7471cbca-6a18-11e6-9c26-78afe9319685.jpg)\n![logging_perf_improvements](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/833693/17951632/7467844e-6a18-11e6-9a0e-053dc7650413.jpg)\n\nThe

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSome analyzer rules have assumptions on logical plans, optimizer may break these assumption, we should not pass an optimized query plan into QueryExecution (will be analyzed again), otherwise we may some weird bugs.\n\nFor example, we have a rule for decimal calculation to promote the precision before binary operations, use PromotePrecision as placeholder to indicate that this rule should not apply twice. But a Optimizer rule will remove this placeholder, that break the assumption, then the rule applied twice, cause wrong result.\n\nIdeally, we should make all the analyzer rules all idempotent, that may require lots of effort to double checking them one by one (may be not easy).\n\nAn easier approach could be never feed a optimized plan into Analyzer, this PR fix the case for RunnableComand, they will be optimized, during execution, the passed `query` will also be passed into QueryExecution again. This PR make these `query` not part of the children, so they will not be optimized and analyzed again.\n\nRight now, we did not know a logical plan is optimized or not, we could introduce a flag for that, and make sure a optimized logical plan will not be analyzed again. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression tests.\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T21:20:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T04:46:36Z","closed_at":"2016-09-02T22:12:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a22f7904252a3f7069ff56c0a9f55ff49f89aec7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02b289673654c2572dc8087e973a714f7c637d36","head":{"label":"davies:fix_writer","ref":"fix_writer","sha":"02b289673654c2572dc8087e973a714f7c637d36","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen reading float4 and smallint columns from PostgreSQL, Spark's `PostgresDialect` widens these types to Decimal and Integer rather than using the narrower Float and Short types. According to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.1/static/datatype.html#DATATYPE-TABLE, Postgres maps the `smallint` type to a signed two-byte integer and the `real` / `float4` types to single precision floating point numbers.\n\nThis patch fixes this by adding more special-cases to `getCatalystType`, similar to what was done for the Derby JDBC dialect. I also fixed a similar problem in the write path which causes Spark to create integer columns in Postgres for what should have been ShortType columns.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test cases in `PostgresIntegrationSuite` (which I ran manually because Jenkins can't run it right now).\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T20:53:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T21:58:21Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T21:25:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"739e6449ebaf3a66f6b8823c2aa66eaf1c581fa8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/708343d59e238322be25751960bf6e4dca47d98b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:postgres-jdbc-type-fixes","ref":"postgres-jdbc-type-fixes","sha":"708343d59e238322be25751960bf6e4dca47d98b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nGiven that filters based on non-deterministic constraints shouldn't be pushed down in the query plan, unnecessarily inferring them is confusing and a source of potential bugs.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR propose to add a new API in `SparkHadoopUtil` to trigger manual credential updating in the run-time.\n\nThis is mainly used in long running spark applications which needs to access different secured system in the run-time. For example, when Zeppelin / Spark Shell needs to access different secured HBase cluster or Hive metastore service in the run-time, it requires tokens from new services and updates to executors immediately. Previously either we need to relaunch the application to get new tokens, or we need to wait until the old tokens to expire to get new ones. \n\nWith this new API, user could manually trigger credential updating in the run-time when required. Credentials will be renewed in AM and updated in executor and driver side.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually verified in the secured cluster.\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T13:56:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T06:33:23Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T06:33:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cff1074114ed04e0c9e1e34863f25d81a9f276d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1cac5c95f3c7f77a8253a88aff48d2a1934072c","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-17209","ref":"SPARK-17209","sha":"b1cac5c95f3c7f77a8253a88aff48d2a1934072c","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, type-widening does not work between `TimestampType` and `DateType`.\n\nThis applies to `SetOperation`, `Union`, `In`, `CaseWhen`, `Greatest`,  `Leatest`, `CreateArray`, `CreateMap`, `Coalesce`, `NullIf`, `IfNull`, `Nvl` and `Nvl2`, .\n\nThis PR adds the support for widening `DateType` to `TimestampType` for them.\n\nFor a simple example, \n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\nSeq(Tuple2(new Timestamp(0), new Date(0))).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").selectExpr(\"greatest(a, b)\").show()\n```\n\nshows below:\n\n```\ncannot resolve 'greatest(`a`, `b`)' due to data type mismatch: The expressions should all have the same type, got GREATEST(timestamp, date)\n```\n\nor union as below:\n\n``` scala\nval a = Seq(Tuple1(new Timestamp(0))).toDF()\nval b = Seq(Tuple1(new Date(0))).toDF()\na.union(b).show()\n```\n\nshows below:\n\n```\nUnion can only be performed on tables with the compatible column types. DateType <> TimestampType at the first column of the second table;\n```\n\n**After**\n\n``` scala\nSeq(Tuple2(new Timestamp(0), new Date(0))).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").selectExpr(\"greatest(a, b)\").show()\n```\n\nshows below:\n\n```\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n|greatest(CAST(a AS TIMESTAMP), CAST(b AS TIMESTAMP))|\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n|                                1969-12-31 16:00:...|\n+----------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\nor union as below:\n\n``` scala\nval a = Seq(Tuple1(new Timestamp(0))).toDF()\nval b = Seq(Tuple1(new Date(0))).toDF()\na.union(b).show()\n```\n\nshows below:\n\n```\n+--------------------+\n|                  _1|\n+--------------------+\n|1969-12-31 16:00:...|\n|1969-12-31 00:00:...|\n+--------------------+\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `TypeCoercionSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T10:55:06Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:59Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T01:01:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0ce4bd2c945112220333fe936d58442fa163c0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d035eb3ba725250f6238a5b8a189b6749065cf95","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17212","ref":"SPARK-17212","sha":"d035eb3ba725250f6238a5b8a189b6749065cf95","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

spark.master from R process to JVM. Otherwise sparkr.zip won't be distributed to executor.  Besides that I also pass spark.yarn.keytab/spark.yarn.principal to spark side, because JVM process need them to access secured cluster. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nVerify it manually in R Studio using the following code.\n\n```\nSys.setenv(SPARK_HOME=\"/Users/jzhang/github/spark\")\n.libPaths(c(file.path(Sys.getenv(), \"R\", \"lib\"), .libPaths()))\nlibrary(SparkR)\nsparkR.session(master=\"yarn-client\", sparkConfig = list(spark.executor.instances=\"1\"))\ndf <- as.DataFrame(mtcars)\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n…

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is part of the original PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14625.\n\nBased on file-based SQL end-to-end testing framework in `SQLQueryTestSuite`, this PR is to create test cases for outer joins. \n\nIn addition, this PR also renamed the test data sets to more meaningful names, based on the comments from @cloud-fan \n### How was this patch tested?\n\nUsing the same data and query, the Hive outputs are attached below:\n[hive.output.txt](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/434258/hive.output.txt)\n\nAfter comparison, the Spark-generated results are the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `Analyze Table` is only used for Hive-serde tables. We should issue exceptions in all the other cases. When the tables are data source tables, we issued an exception. However, when tables are In-Memory Cataloged tables, we do not issue any exception.\n\nThis PR is to issue an exception when the tables are in-memory cataloged. For example,  \n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE tbl(a INT, b INT) USING parquet\n```\n\n`tbl` is a `SimpleCatalogRelation` when the hive support is not enabled.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded two test cases. One of them is just to improve the test coverage when the analyzed table is data source tables.\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T05:07:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T14:07:35Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T14:07:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"550474c7c37f9bd767de920fc9ee69f2aa5051d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/77666fd83f5bab69dc7191a6e1a8f7d253300de0","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:analyzeInMemoryTable2","ref":"analyzeInMemoryTable2","sha":"77666fd83f5bab69dc7191a6e1a8f7d253300de0","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes the documentation about functions returning `DateType`s to mention the time part will be truncated.\n\nCurrently, the functions, `add_months`, `date_add`, `date_sub`, `last_day`, `next_day`, `to_date` and `trunc` can take `TimestampType` or string representation including time part as below:\n\n``` scala\nval df = Seq(Tuple1(Timestamp.valueOf(\"2012-07-16 12:12:12\"))).toDF(\"ts\")\ndf.selectExpr(\"ts\", \"add_months(ts, 1)\", \"date_add(ts, 1)\", \"date_sub(ts, 1)\").show()\ndf.selectExpr(\"ts\", \"last_day(ts)\", \"\"\"next_day(ts, \"TU\")\"\"\", \"to_date(ts)\", \"\"\"trunc(ts, \"MM\")\"\"\").show()\n```\n\nHowever, for those functions, the time part is truncated as below:\n\n```\n+--------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+\n|                  ts|add_months(CAST(ts AS DATE), 1)|date_add(CAST(ts AS DATE), 1)|date_sub(CAST(ts AS DATE), 1)|\n+--------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+\n|2012-07-16 12:12:...|                     2012-08-16|                   2012-07-17|                   2012-07-15|\n+--------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+\n\n+--------------------+--------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+\n|                  ts|last_day(CAST(ts AS DATE))|next_day(CAST(ts AS DATE), TU)|to_date(CAST(ts AS DATE))|trunc(CAST(ts AS DATE), MM)|\n+--------------------+--------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+\n|2012-07-16 12:12:...|                2012-07-31|                    2012-07-17|               2012-07-16|                 2012-07-01|\n+--------------------+--------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+\n```\n\nIn user's perspective, this might be weird and look undocumented behaviour (just like this JIRA was open).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn current spark DA mode, if we enabled blacklist, it will have a chance to hang the Spark job.\n\nexample:\nexecutor: A, taskset(task1), blacklistTime > 60s\n1. task1 allocated in exec-A, and failed, so exec-A is blacklist for task1\n2. exec-A idled out before can't get any task to run. Because exec-A idled out, `yarnAllocator` decrease the `YarnAllocator.targetExecutorNumber` to 0. \nIn the meantime, DA always calculate `DA.targetExecutor` = 1. and so the `DA.oldTargetNumExecutors` also be 1, then the `DA.delta` = 0, and result `DA` will not tell the `YarnAllocator` the actual needed targetNumber.  \n3. So, because current delta=0, will skip `DA.targetExecutor -> YarnAllocator.targetExecutor`, then `DA.targetExecutor` = 1 while `YarnAllocator.targetExecutor` = 0,  it will never get a executor to run task, it hangs.\n\nThis patch adopts the easiest way just remove `delta = 0` logic, the shortage is will always communicate with YarnAllocator.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual test\n","created_at":"2016-08-23T03:23:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T08:44:13Z","closed_at":"2016-09-23T08:44:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac42674e38c129bc392d8b4ff67012a172256ea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59de77b5f523340d50836f072b38afee9bf579c3","head":{"label":"suyanNone:fix-hang","ref":"fix-hang","sha":"59de77b5f523340d50836f072b38afee9bf579c3","user":{"login":"suyanNone","id":9818852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTg4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9818852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone","html_url":"https://github.com/suyanNone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26800336,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjgwMDMzNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"suyanNone/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"suyanNone","id":9818852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTg4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9818852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone","html_url":"https://github.com/suyanNone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyanNone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/suyanNone/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR gives informative message to users when they try to connect to a remote master but don't have Spark package in their local machine.  \n\nAs a clarification, for now, automatic installation will only happen if they start SparkR in R console (rather than from sparkr-shell) and connect to local master. In the remote master mode, local Spark package is still needed, but we will not trigger the install.spark function because the versions have to match those on the cluster, which involves more user input. Instead, we here try to provide detailed message that may help the users.\n\nSome of the other messages have also been slightly changed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test.\n","created_at":"2016-08-22T21:01:38Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T23:06:25Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T23:06:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1614a58efae7cc8d7db8d9e09d930e4b7d5e29da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4dc8b1e5f2ed47b9007a10c8b762a33056919775","head":{"label":"junyangq:SPARK-16579-V1","ref":"SPARK-16579-V1","sha":"4dc8b1e5f2ed47b9007a10c8b762a33056919775","user":{"login":"junyangq","id":15318264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzE4MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15318264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq","html_url":"https://github.com/junyangq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45086006,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTA4NjAwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"junyangq/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junyangq","id":15318264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzE4MjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15318264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq","html_url":"https://github.com/junyangq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junyangq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junyangq/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSince `HiveClient` is used to interact with the Hive metastore, it should be hidden in `HiveExternalCatalog`. After moving `HiveClient` into `HiveExternalCatalog`, `HiveSharedState` becomes a wrapper of `HiveExternalCatalog`. Thus, removal of `HiveSharedState` becomes straightforward. After removal of `HiveSharedState`, the reflection logic is directly applied on the choice of `ExternalCatalog` types, based on the configuration of `CATALOG_IMPLEMENTATION`. \n\n~~`HiveClient` is also used/invoked by the other entities besides HiveExternalCatalog, we defines the following two APIs: getClient and getNewClient~~\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases\n","created_at":"2016-08-22T17:38:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T04:52:12Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T04:52:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df7b648070e4b21a8a6623cbe03b534cd029eb29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7775ba5d5c3489a8f170a643114b281b4db4fc03","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:removeHiveClient","ref":"removeHiveClient","sha":"7775ba5d5c3489a8f170a643114b281b4db4fc03","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR introduces an abstract class `TypedImperativeAggregate` so that an aggregation function of TypedImperativeAggregate can use  **arbitrary** user-defined Java object as intermediate aggregation buffer object.\n\n**This has advantages like:**\n1. It now can support larger category of aggregation functions. For example, it will be much easier to implement aggregation function `percentile_approx`, which has a complex aggregation buffer definition.\n2. It can be used to avoid doing serialization/de-serialization for every call of `update` or `merge` when converting domain specific aggregation object to internal Spark-Sql storage format.\n3. It is easier to integrate with other existing monoid libraries like algebird, and supports more aggregation functions with high performance. \n\nPlease see `org.apache.spark.sql.TypedImperativeAggregateSuite.TypedMaxAggregate` to find an example of how to defined a `TypedImperativeAggregate` aggregation function.\nPlease see Java doc of `TypedImperativeAggregate` and Jira ticket SPARK-17187 for more information.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nActually Spark SQL doesn't support index, the catalog table type `INDEX` is from Hive. However, most operations in Spark SQL can't handle index table, e.g. create table, alter table, etc.\n\nLogically index table should be invisible to end users, and Hive also generates special table name for index table to avoid users accessing it directly. Hive has special SQL syntax to create/show/drop index tables.\n\nAt Spark SQL side, although we can describe index table directly, but the result is unreadable, we should use the dedicated SQL syntax to do it(e.g. `SHOW INDEX ON tbl`). Spark SQL can also read index table directly, but the result is always empty.(Can hive read index table directly?)\n\nThis PR remove the table type `INDEX`, to make it clear that Spark SQL doesn't support index currently.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-08-22T14:04:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T14:23:49Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T06:47:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e3ce3e750d153f478961a530d7616fb99636159","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1e83d2ace803b51ea3d25c575b84e1af6bde353","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:minor2","ref":"minor2","sha":"d1e83d2ace803b51ea3d25c575b84e1af6bde353","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor data source tables, we will put its table schema, partition columns, etc. to table properties, to work around some hive metastore issues, e.g. not case-preserving, bad decimal type support, etc.\n\nWe should also do this for hive serde tables, to reduce the difference between hive serde tables and data source tables, e.g. column names should be case preserving.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests, and a new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn cases when QuantileDiscretizerSuite is called upon a numeric array with duplicated elements,  we will  take the unique elements generated from approxQuantiles as input for Bucketizer.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAn unit test is added in QuantileDiscretizerSuite\n\nQuantileDiscretizer.fit will throw an illegal exception when calling setSplits on a list of splits\nwith duplicated elements. Bucketizer.setSplits should only accept either a numeric vector of two\nor more unique cut points, although that may produce less number of buckets than requested.\n\nSigned-off-by: VinceShieh

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, CSV datasource allows to load duplicated empty string fields or fields having `nullValue` in the header. It'd be great if this can deal with normal fields as well.\n\nThis PR proposes handling the duplicates consistently with the existing behaviour with considering case-sensitivity (`spark.sql.caseSensitive`) as below:\n\ndata below:\n\n```\nfieldA,fieldB,,FIELDA,fielda,,\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n```\n\nis parsed as below:\n\n``` scala\nspark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").load(\"test.csv\").show()\n```\n- when `spark.sql.caseSensitive` is `false` (by default).\n  \n  ```\n  +-------+------+---+-------+-------+---+---+\n  |fieldA0|fieldB|_c2|FIELDA3|fieldA4|_c5|_c6|\n  +-------+------+---+-------+-------+---+---+\n  |      1|     2|  3|      4|      5|  6|  7|\n  +-------+------+---+-------+-------+---+---+\n  ```\n- when `spark.sql.caseSensitive` is `true`.\n  \n  ```\n  +-------+------+---+-------+-------+---+---+\n  |fieldA0|fieldB|_c2| FIELDA|fieldA4|_c5|_c6|\n  +-------+------+---+-------+-------+---+---+\n  |      1|     2|  3|      4|      5|  6|  7|\n  +-------+------+---+-------+-------+---+---+\n  ```\n\n**In more details**, \n\nThere is a good reference about this problem, `read.csv()` in R. So, I initially wanted to propose the similar behaviour.\n\nIn case of R,  the CSV data below:\n\n```\nfieldA,fieldB,,fieldA,fieldA,,\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n```\n\nis parsed as below:\n\n``` r\ntest <- read.csv(file=\"test.csv\",header=TRUE,sep=\",\")\n> test\n  fieldA fieldB X fieldA.1 fieldA.2 X.1 X.2\n1      1      2 3        4        5   6   7\n```\n\nHowever, Spark CSV datasource already is handling duplicated empty strings and `nullValue` as field names. So the data below:\n\n```\n,,,fieldA,,fieldB,\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n```\n\nis parsed as below:\n\n``` scala\nspark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").load(\"test.csv\").show()\n```\n\n```\n+---+---+---+------+---+------+---+\n|_c0|_c1|_c2|fieldA|_c4|fieldB|_c6|\n+---+---+---+------+---+------+---+\n|  1|  2|  3|     4|  5|     6|  7|\n+---+---+---+------+---+------+---+\n```\n\nR starts the number for each duplicate but Spark adds the number for its position for all fields for `nullValue` and empty strings.\n\nIn terms of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, once we create `RelationalGroupedDataset`, we cannot access the grouping columns from its instance.\nAnalog to `Dataset` we can have a public method which returns the list of grouping columns. \nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L457\n\nThis can be useful for instance in SparkR when we want to have certain logic associated with the grouping columns, accessible from `RelationalGroupedDataset`.\n\n---\n\nSimilar to `Dataset.columns` I've added `RelationalGroupedDataset.columns` method which makes grouping column names accessible.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `DataFrameAggregateSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-08-21T21:35:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:05Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c8dd0880fe199cd7274fe42fcc300896fa9814a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02d6bab047c9ae99f3ef154826a362529d0423be","head":{"label":"NarineK:Make_columns_accessible_from_RelationalGroupedDataset","ref":"Make_columns_accessible_from_RelationalGroupedDataset","sha":"02d6bab047c9ae99f3ef154826a362529d0423be","user":{"login":"NarineK","id":12010601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDEwNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12010601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK","html_url":"https://github.com/NarineK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42900480,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkwMDQ4MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"NarineK/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NarineK","id":12010601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDEwNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12010601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK","html_url":"https://github.com/NarineK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarineK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NarineK/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe Spark SQL doesn’t support field names that contains dots. It’s not about queries like `select` but about any manipulations with the dataset.\nHere is a dataset example:\n\n```\nfield1,field1.some,field2,field3.some\n\"field1\",\"field1.some\",\"field2\",\"field3.some\"\n```\n\nAnd a code snippet:\n\n```\nscala> spark.sqlContext.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").load(“/tmp/test.csv\").collect\n```\n\nThe result of this operation:\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Can't extract value from field1#0;\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExtractValue$.apply(complexTypeExtractors.scala:73)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan$$anonfun$3.apply(LogicalPlan.scala:253)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan$$anonfun$3.apply(LogicalPlan.scala:252)\n  at scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized$class.foldLeft(LinearSeqOptimized.scala:124)\n  at scala.collection.immutable.List.foldLeft(List.scala:84)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan.resolve(LogicalPlan.scala:252)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan.resolveQuoted(LogicalPlan.scala:168)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan$$anonfun$resolve$1.apply(LogicalPlan.scala:130)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan$$anonfun$resolve$1.apply(LogicalPlan.scala:129)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.Iterator$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:893)\n….\n```\n\nThe following code fails with the same error:\n\n```\nscala> val df = spark.sqlContext.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", \"true\").option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").load(\"/tmp/test.csv\")\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [field1: string, field1.some: string ... 2 more fields]\n\nscala> df.select(\"field1\", \"`field1.some`\", \"field2\", \"`field3.some`\").collect\n```\n\nThis patch makes `LogicalPlan` treat a dot-separated string as an attribute's name in case when nested fields resolution fails.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests. Tested with a mentioned CSV file in the `CSVSuite` (not committed). I'm not sure where exactly I should put a test for this. `LogicalPlanSuite` doesn't look like appropriate place for this.\n","created_at":"2016-08-20T20:15:01Z","updated_at":"2016-08-21T13:47:57Z","closed_at":"2016-08-21T13:47:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1373a6b56513acb09dff6564ea52bdb78b40c537","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6059dfce21c071f4022ab6a17316a85748f0729e","head":{"label":"izeigerman:iaroslav/spark-17024","ref":"iaroslav/spark-17024","sha":"6059dfce21c071f4022ab6a17316a85748f0729e","user":{"login":"izeigerman","id":7747479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDc0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7747479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman","html_url":"https://github.com/izeigerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66150686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjE1MDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"izeigerman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"izeigerman","id":7747479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDc0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7747479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman","html_url":"https://github.com/izeigerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izeigerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/izeigerman/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR optimises the filesystem metadata reads in `FileInputDStream`, by moving the filters used in `FileSystem.globStatus` and `FileSystem.listStatus` into filtering of the `FileStatus` instances returned in the results, so avoiding the need to create `FileStatus` instances within the `FileSystem` operation.\n- This doesn't add overhead to the filtering process; that's done as post-processing in the`FileSystem` glob/list operations anyway.\n- At worst it may result in larger lists being built up and returned.\n- For every glob match of a file, the code saves 1 RPC calls to the HDFS NN; 1 GET against S3\n- For every glob match of a directory, the code the code saves 1 RPC call and 2-3 HTTP calls to S3 for the directory check (including a slow List call whenever the directory has children as it doesn't exist as a blob any more)\n- for the modtime check of every file, it saves a Hadoop RPC call, against all object stores _which don't implement any client-side cache_, an HTTP GET. \n- By entirely eliminating all `getFileStatus()` calls in the listed files, it should reduce the risk of AWS S3 throttling the HTTP request, as it does when too many requests are made to parts of a single S3 bucket.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRunning the spark streaming tests as a regression suite. In the SPARK-7481 cloud code, I could add a test against S3 which prints to stdout the exact number of HTTP requests made to S3 before and after the patch, so as to validate speedup. (the S3A metrics in Hadoop 2.8+ are accessible at the API level, but as they are only accessible in a new API added in 2.8; it'd stop that proposed module building against Hadoop 2.7. Logging and manual assessment is the only cross-version strategy.\n","created_at":"2016-08-20T11:18:36Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T17:38:24Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T12:03:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9161d566e7aa6da237a66e442f8d6ceb28cdd6b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14731/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14731/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14731/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3aaf267d2ac30c012b4a71b7a80e28a49ff10be","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cloud/SPARK-17159-listfiles","ref":"cloud/SPARK-17159-listfiles","sha":"a3aaf267d2ac30c012b4a71b7a80e28a49ff10be","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `Analyze Table` is only used for Hive-serde tables. We should issue exceptions in all the other cases. When the tables are data source tables, we issued an exception. However, when tables are In-Memory Cataloged tables, we do not issue any exception.\n\nThis PR is to issue an exception when the tables are in-memory cataloged. For example,  \n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE tbl(a INT, b INT) USING parquet\n```\n\n`tbl` is a `SimpleCatalogRelation` when the hive support is not enabled.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded two test cases. One of them is just to improve the test coverage when the analyzed table is data source tables.\n","created_at":"2016-08-20T07:01:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T05:07:50Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T05:07:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a32a1a433059c56e977712ece554295db41e83a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bb3fd8f3f88f651dec7d8adb5650b80336c23443","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:analyzeInMemoryCatalogedTables","ref":"analyzeInMemoryCatalogedTables","sha":"bb3fd8f3f88f651dec7d8adb5650b80336c23443","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this change, FileStreamSource uses an in-memory hash set to track the list of files processed by the engine. The list can grow indefinitely, leading to OOM or overflow of the hash set.\n\nThis patch introduces a new user-defined option called \"maxFileAge\", default to 24 hours. If a file is older than this age, FileStreamSource will purge it from the in-memory map that was used to track the list of files that have been processed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests for the underlying utility, and also added an end-to-end test to validate the purge in FileStreamSourceSuite. Also verified the new test cases would fail when the timeout was set to a very large number.\n","created_at":"2016-08-20T06:40:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T18:32:45Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T18:32:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc65345523a11af20446c9b556c81a19eff8f463","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9a5ed19f3b397b991794a6852aebb2b14c83d635","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-17165","ref":"SPARK-17165","sha":"9a5ed19f3b397b991794a6852aebb2b14c83d635","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror
