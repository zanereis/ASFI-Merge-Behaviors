Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims at improving performance for Hash joins with many duplicate keys. \r\n\r\nA HashedRelation uses a map underneath to store rows against a corresponding key. A LongToUnsafeRowMap is used by LongHashedRelation and a BytesToBytesMap is used by UnsafeHashedRelation.\r\nWe propose to reorder the underlying map thereby placing all the rows for a given key adjacent in the memory to improve the spatial locality while iterating over them in the stream side of the join.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved in the following steps:\r\n- creating another copy of the underlying map\r\n- for all keys in the existing map\r\n  - get the corresponding rows \r\n  - insert all the rows for the given key at once in the new map\r\n- use the new map for look-ups\r\n\r\nThis optimization can be enabled by specifying `spark.sql.hashedRelationReorderFactor=<value>`.\r\nOnce the condition `number of rows >= number of unique keys * above value` is satisfied for the underlying map, the optimization will kick in.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere is no order maintained when the rows are added to the underlying map, thus for a given key, the corresponding rows are typically non-adjacent in memory, resulting in a poor spatial locality. Placing the rows for adjacent in memory yields a performance boost thereby reducing execution time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Modified existing unit tests to run against the suggested improvement.\r\n- Added a couple of cases to test the scenarios when the improvement throws an exception due to insufficient memory.\r\n- Added a micro-benchmark that clearly indicates performance improvements when there are duplicate keys.\r\n- Ran the four example queries mentioned in the JIRA in spark-sql as a final check for performance improvement.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nThis work is based on the initial idea proposed by @bersprockets.","created_at":"2021-12-29T02:12:45Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T06:53:45Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T06:39:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da7207120b9d1bfb6796e5effdb32ac592d786ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/772070cba057c7c4138eeb9c7b5e4059141e2290","head":{"label":"sumeetgajjar:SPARK-37175-HashRelation-Optimization","ref":"SPARK-37175-HashRelation-Optimization","sha":"772070cba057c7c4138eeb9c7b5e4059141e2290","user":{"login":"sumeetgajjar","id":7351922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar","html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":354211726,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQyMTE3MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"sumeetgajjar/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sumeetgajjar","id":7351922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar","html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar/spark","description":"Apache

is still missing a way to handle typing and also a set of tests\r\nfor the API, but it's a functional implementation to showcase the examples\r\nwritten down in the PR and the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt adds a new class, `DynamicDataFrame`, that allows users to implement inheritance on the `DataFrames` without losing chainability. The PR also has the autogenerator of the `DynamicDataFrame` class code in case any reviewer wants to remove one of the methods from the default-inherited ones.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn typical development settings, multiple tables with very different concepts are mapped to the same `DataFrame` class. The inheritance from the pyspark `DataFrame` class is a bit cumbersome because of the chainable methods and it also makes it difficult to abstract regularly used queries. The proposal is to generate a `DynamicDataFrame` that allows easy inheritance retaining `DataFrame` methods without losing chainability neither for the newly generated queries nor for the usual dataframe ones.\r\n\r\nIn our experience, this allowed us to iterate much faster, generating business-centric classes in a couple of lines of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes: it adds a new class. It doesn't change any already existing code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere is no test suite here since we are not sure about how to properly test the new API (we are inclined to generate one test case per method, ensuring that it generates objects of the proper type). We add here two code examples:\r\n\r\n#### Inheriting from DataFrame\r\nThis shows the typical issues encountered when we try to inherit from pyspark `DataFrame`. It should work on the `master` branch as well\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyspark\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n\r\nspark = pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Inventory(DataFrame):\r\n    def __init__(self, df: DataFrame):\r\n        super().__init__(df._jdf, df.sql_ctx)\r\n\r\n    def update_prices(self, factor: float = 2.0):\r\n        return self.withColumn(\"price\", F.col(\"price\") * factor)\r\n\r\n\r\nbase_dataframe = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    data=[[\"product_1\", 2.0], [\"product_2\", 4.0]],\r\n    schema=[\"name\", \"price\"],\r\n)\r\ninventory = Inventory(base_dataframe)\r\ninventory_updated = inventory.update_prices(2.0)\r\nprint(\"inventory_updated.show():\")\r\ninventory_updated.show()\r\nprint(\"But after one use of the query we have a plain dataframe again\")\r\nprint(f\"type(inventory_updated): {type(inventory_updated) }\")\r\n# This would raise an AttributeError\r\n# inventory_updated.update_prices(5.0)\r\n\r\nprint(\"The same happens when we use DataFrame methods\")\r\nexpensive_inventory = inventory.filter(F.col(\"price\") > 3.0)\r\nprint(\"expensive_inventory.show():\")\r\nexpensive_inventory.show()\r\nprint(f\"type(expensive_inventory): {type(expensive_inventory) }\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand its output\r\n```\r\ninventory_updated.show():\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|     name|price|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|product_1|  4.0|\r\n|product_2|  8.0|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n\r\nBut after one use of the query we have a plain dataframe again\r\ntype(inventory_updated): <class 'pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame'>\r\nThe same happens when we use DataFrame methods\r\nexpensive_inventory.show():\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|     name|price|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|product_2|  4.0|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n\r\ntype(expensive_inventory): <class 'pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame'>\r\n```\r\n#### Inheritance from DynamicDataFrame\r\nThis is what inheritance would look like if we used `DynamicDataFrame`, that runs on the current branch:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyspark\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import DynamicDataFrame\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n\r\nspark = pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Inventory(DynamicDataFrame):\r\n    def update_prices(self, factor: float = 2.0):\r\n        return self.withColumn(\"price\", F.col(\"price\") * factor)\r\n\r\n\r\nbase_dataframe = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    data=[[\"product_1\", 2.0], [\"product_2\", 4.0]],\r\n    schema=[\"name\", \"price\"],\r\n)\r\nprint(\"Doing an inheritance mediated by DynamicDataFrame\")\r\ninventory = Inventory(base_dataframe)\r\ninventory_updated = inventory.update_prices(2.0).update_prices(5.0)\r\nprint(\"inventory_updated.show():\")\r\ninventory_updated.show()\r\nprint(\"After multiple uses of the query we still have the desired type\")\r\nprint(f\"type(inventory_updated): {type(inventory_updated)}\")\r\nprint(\"We can still use the usual dataframe methods\")\r\nexpensive_inventory = inventory_updated.filter(F.col(\"price\") > 25)\r\nprint(\"expensive_inventory.show():\")\r\nexpensive_inventory.show()\r\nprint(\"And retain the desired type\")\r\nprint(f\"type(expensive_inventory): {type(expensive_inventory)}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand its output:\r\n```\r\nDoing an inheritance mediated by DynamicDataFrame\r\ninventory_updated.show():\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|     name|price|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|product_1| 20.0|\r\n|product_2| 40.0|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n\r\nAfter multiple uses of the query we still have the desired type\r\ntype(inventory_updated): <class '__main__.Inventory'>\r\nWe can still use the usual dataframe methods\r\nexpensive_inventory.show():\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|     name|price|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n|product_2| 40.0|\r\n+---------+-----+\r\n\r\nAnd retain the desired type\r\ntype(expensive_inventory): <class

running `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython pyspark` on xterm the find-spark-home script calls `ipython /path/to/find_spark_home.py` and the string printed by that script gets assigned to SPARK_HOME. When run with IPython that string will start with a sequence bounded by control characters before the path determined by find_spark_home.py. While this part of the string does not appear on echo it will cause pyspark to compose paths improperly when using SPARK_HOME.\r\n\r\nTo see the sequence run:\r\n\r\n>>> import os\r\n>>> p = os.popen('ipython somescript.py')\r\n>>> p.read()\r\n\r\n`'\\x1b[22;0t\\x1b]0;IPython: {current directory}\\x07the expected output\\n'`\r\n\r\nThe cut command removes the sequence before \"the expected output\". Lines without a bell character (\\x07), such as you get when running `python3 find_spark_home.py`, remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixing the assignment to SPARK_HOME in find-spark-home to remove the control characters added when using ipython.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOn xterm running `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=ipython pyspark` causes pyspark to compose paths improperly, prepending the current working directory to SPARK_HOME as determined by find_spark_home.py, making it unable to find the files it seeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the change I would get \"No such file or directory\" errors as the current working directory would get prepended to SPARK_HOME. After the change the pyspark interactive prompt starts as expected with an ipython prompt.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI ran pyspark with PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON set to \"python\", \"python3\" and \"ipython\". All three variations gave the appropriate prompt with the expected session and context variables set. I also tested the pipe to the cut command with lines with and without bell characters to ensure that the addition had no effect on the latter. I didn't modify the current testing scheme because I couldn't find an extant test for any of the relevant bash scripts.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-28T20:18:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T00:20:07Z","closed_at":"2022-04-14T00:20:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3616ad1611dea8034a1a046a0211c33e113fe5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/973592dab22e5c607d7b73724108dd21f3062585","head":{"label":"Shooter23:remove-ipython-prefix-from-spark-home","ref":"remove-ipython-prefix-from-spark-home","sha":"973592dab22e5c607d7b73724108dd21f3062585","user":{"login":"Shooter23","id":44271378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjcxMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44271378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23","html_url":"https://github.com/Shooter23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":442378448,"node_id":"R_kgDOGl4o0A","name":"spark","full_name":"Shooter23/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Shooter23","id":44271378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjcxMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44271378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23","html_url":"https://github.com/Shooter23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shooter23/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Shooter23/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new metadata key `org.apache.spark.timeZone` which Spark writes to Parquet/Avro matadata while performing of datetimes rebase in the `LEGACY` mode (see the SQL configs:\r\n- `spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite`,\r\n- `spark.sql.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` and\r\n- `spark.sql.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite`).\r\n\r\nThe writers uses the current session time zone (see the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`) in rebasing of Parquet/Avro timestamp columns.\r\n\r\nAt the reader side, Spark tries to get info about the writer's time zone from the new metadata property:\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar ~parquet-tools-1.12.0.jar meta ./part-00000-b0d90bf0-ce60-4b4f-b453-b33f61ab2b2a-c000.snappy.parquet\r\n...\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.timeZone = America/Los_Angeles\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.legacyDateTime =\r\n```\r\nand use it in rebasing timestamps to the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. In the case when the reader cannot retrieve the original time zone from Parquet/Avro metadata, it uses the default JVM time zone for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore the changes, Spark assumes that a writer uses the default JVM time zone while rebasing of dates/timestamps. And if a reader and the writer have different JVM time zone settings, the reader cannot load such columns in the `LEGACY` mode correctly. So, the reader will have full info about writer settings after the changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, Parquet/Avro writers use the session time zone while timestamp rebasing in the `LEGACY` mode instead of the default JVM time zone. Need to highlight that the session time zone is set to the JVM time zone by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n```\r\n2. And related existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *RebaseDateTimeSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *TimestampFormatterSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"avro/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.avro.AvroCatalystDataConversionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroRowReaderSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroSerdeSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetVectorizedSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Also modified the test `SPARK-31159: rebasing timestamps in write` to check loading timestamps in the LEGACY mode when the session time zone and JVM time zone are different.\r\n\r\n4. Generated parquet files by Spark 3.2.0 (the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5d45a415f3a29898d92380380cfd82bfc7f579ea) using the test `\"SPARK-31806: generate test files for checking compatibility with Spark 2.4\"`. The parquet files don't contain info about the original time zone:\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar ~/Downloads/parquet-tools-1.12.0.jar meta sql/core/src/test/resources/test-data/before_1582_timestamp_micros_v3_2_0.snappy.parquet\r\nfile:        file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/parquet-rebase-save-tz/sql/core/src/test/resources/test-data/before_1582_timestamp_micros_v3_2_0.snappy.parquet\r\ncreator:     parquet-mr version 1.12.1 (build 2a5c06c58fa987f85aa22170be14d927d5ff6e7d)\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.version = 3.2.0\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.legacyINT96 =\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.metadata = {\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"dict\",\"type\":\"timestamp\",\"nullable\":true,\"metadata\":{}},{\"name\":\"plain\",\"type\":\"timestamp\",\"nullable\":true,\"metadata\":{}}]}\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.legacyDateTime =\r\n\r\nfile schema: spark_schema\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndict:        OPTIONAL INT64 L:TIMESTAMP(MICROS,true) R:0 D:1\r\nplain:       OPTIONAL INT64 L:TIMESTAMP(MICROS,true) R:0 D:1\r\n```\r\nBy running the test `\"SPARK-31159, SPARK-37705: compatibility with Spark 2.4/3.2 in reading dates/timestamps\"`, check loading of mixed parquet files generated by Spark 2.4.5/2.4.6 and 3.2.0/master.\r\n\r\n5.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35002 .\r\n\r\nWhen an OrcColumnarBatchReader is created, method initBatch will be called only once. In method initBatch:\r\n\r\n`orcVectorWrappers[i] = OrcColumnVectorUtils.toOrcColumnVector(dt, wrap.batch().cols[colId]);`\r\n\r\nWhen the second argument of toOrcColumnVector is a ListColumnVector/MapColumnVector, orcVectorWrappers[i] is initialized with the ListColumnVector or MapColumnVector's offsets and lengths. \r\n\r\nHowever, when method nextBatch of OrcColumnarBatchReader is called, method ensureSize of ColumnVector (and its subclasses, like MultiValuedColumnVector) could be called, then the ListColumnVector/MapColumnVector's offsets and lengths could refer to new array objects. This could result in the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes OrcArrayColumnVector.getArray and OrcMapColumnVector.getMap always get offsets and lengths from the underlying

improvements. (https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.6.0)\r\n- Java 17\r\n  > The Scala version used to compile build.sbt is updated to Scala 2.12.15, which improves the compatibility with JDK 17+.\r\n\r\n  > sbt.TrapExit is dropped due to Security Manager being deprecated in JDK 17. Calling sys.exit in run or test would shutdown the sbt session.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37738\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a skew in the Scala Spark API & PySpark API; namely, date_add/ date_sub/ add_months take an 'int' type for the 'days' parameter in PySpark, but can accept a column or an integer in Scala.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes both types available to the 'days' parameter in PySpark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers should see a consistent API across Python & Scala side processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes- additive only.\r\n\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([('2015-04-08', 2,)], ['dt', 'add'])\r\n>>> df.select(date_add(df.dt, df.add).alias('next_date')).collect()\r\n[Row(next_date=datetime.date(2015,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new configuration `spark.sql.ansi.strictIndexOperator` which controls whether throwing exceptions or returning null results when element not exists in the [] operator in array/map type\r\n\r\nThe default value of the new configuration is true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* Provide an alternative way for Spark SQL users who relies on null results when element not exists in array/map, e.g. `select .. where array[index] is not null` or `select .. where map[key] is not null`\r\n* Map type is not part of the ANSI SQL type. There can be arguments that map[key] should return null if key not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, providing a new option `spark.sql.ansi.strictIndexOperator` which can optionally return null result if element not exists in array/map. However, the default behavior is not changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to update task metrics from datasource v2 custom metrics.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have updated task metrics such as `bytesWritten` and `recordsWritten` from built-in data source v2 format e.g. Parquet. For other data source v2 formats, we can define some builtin metric names so Spark can also recognize them and update task metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Some special DS v2 custom metrics are updated to task metrics.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-26T22:59:36Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:26:43Z","closed_at":"2021-12-29T06:09:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc4356b95c37788b6facc1303ce2149f85d27ae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the behavior of checking initialization of log4j 2\r\n\r\nthe code used to check initialization is shown below.\r\n```scala\r\n      val log4j2Initialized = !LogManager.getRootLogger\r\n        .asInstanceOf[org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Logger].getAppenders.isEmpty\r\n```\r\nThat works for log4j. However, log4j2 provides a default configuration so there is always a appender (`ConsoleAppender`) with `ERROR` level.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`log4j2-defaults.properties` does not work, since log4j 2 is always initialized by default configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to eliminate the user-facing change after migrating to log4j2. \r\n1. the root level is `ERROR` now but previous root level was `INFO`.\r\n2. `log4j2-defaults.properties` is not loaded but `log4j-defaults.properties` was used to initialize log4j.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI test it manually in k8s. It shows INFO level message as before now.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-26T16:58:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-31T09:21:52Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T19:13:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c928f2787fca99d002e6461850a8b7706a1a275","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd57b0a5e19b8f7369d8fa5a8178e0fa630e7739","head":{"label":"chia7712:SPARK-37746","ref":"SPARK-37746","sha":"fd57b0a5e19b8f7369d8fa5a8178e0fa630e7739","user":{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":441939399,"node_id":"R_kgDOGld1xw","name":"spark","full_name":"chia7712/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInline annotations for `pyspark.mllib.linalg.__init__.py`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files  `pyspark.mllib.linalg.__init__.pyi` to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixed the checkstyle error thrown in windows in maven installing phase.\r\n\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDue to some problems in CI system, these obvious errors have not been detected. I think these checkstyle errors should be solved.\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHow was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have verified by executing following commands in the win10 system, except for (modifier) RedundantModifier in TimSort.java and (naming) MethodName in GroupStateTimeout.java and OutputMode.java and Trigger.java, the rest of the errors have been fixed.\r\n`mvn -DskipTest clean

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `appId` interface to KubernetesConf\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `appId` now can be only accessed in `KuberntesDriverConf` and `KubernetesExecutorConf`, but can't be accesssed in `KubernetesConf`.\r\n\r\nSome user featurestep are using `KubernetesConf` as init constructor parameter in order to share the featurestep between driver and executor. One of cases is customized feature step (such as volcano, yunikorn) is using appId as job identification.\r\n\r\nSo, we'd better add appId to KubernetesConf to help such featurestep access appId.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a regression by upgrading to log4j 2. `SparkContext.setLogLevel` should work in spark-shell.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in spark-shell `SparkContext.setLogLevel` can not work well.\r\n\r\nPreviously log4j 1.x API only calls the API on logger to set logging level. Now with log4j 2.x, the updated logging level at root logger is not taken by other loggers. We need to explicitly ask updating loggers with the updated logger config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, the upgrading is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManual test and unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange log level of tests to WARN\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34895, the log level of tests becomes either \"INFO\" or \"DEBUG\", this increases the log output file to over 100MB!\r\nE.g https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark/runs/4623214509?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to find the CI test failures. Changing the log level of tests to WARN should help.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIt's just conf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark aggregate pushdown will translate some standard aggregate functions, so that compile these functions to adapt specify

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAccording to [#cmt](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34819#discussion_r763629569), unify the error of v1, v2 and hive external catalog in DROP NAMESPACE tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, v1 and hive external catalog command throw `AnalysisException`, while v2 command throws `SparkException`. The error messages of v1 and hive catalog are also completely different from v2.\r\nSo this PR is for unifying those errors to `AnalysisException`. The error message will have one difference between v1/hive and v2: `Cannot drop a non-empty database: ...` vs `Cannot drop a non-empty namespace: ...`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nv1/v2 and Hive v1 DropNamespaceSuite:\r\n\r\n```$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes `dev/test-dependencies.sh` to extract the versions of dependencies accurately.\r\nIn the current implementation, the versions are extracted like as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGUAVA_VERSION=`build/mvn help:evaluate -Dexpression=guava.version -q -DforceStdout`\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, if the output of the `mvn` command includes not only the version but also other messages like warnings, a following command referring the version will fail.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.google.guava:guava:${GUAVA_VERSION} -q\r\n...\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.1:get (default-cli) on project spark-parent_2.12: Couldn't download artifact: org.eclipse.aether.resolution.DependencyResolutionException: com.google.guava:guava:jar:Falling was not found in https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/ during a previous attempt.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo recover the CI.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually run `dev/test-dependencies.sh`.","created_at":"2021-12-24T02:15:46Z","updated_at":"2021-12-24T02:30:01Z","closed_at":"2021-12-24T02:30:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8556090a037e95c4bdb4db22bd27620f0df4605c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/85287efa7d6a990b2bf294e513313c4d88be011b","head":{"label":"sarutak:followup-SPARK-37302","ref":"followup-SPARK-37302","sha":"85287efa7d6a990b2bf294e513313c4d88be011b","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

checkpoint job only once when asked to do so eagerly.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe flow is like so:\r\n```\r\n- df.checkpoint(eager = true, reliable = true)\r\n  - rdd = get rdd from this df's physical plan\r\n  - rdd.checkpoint (just marks checkpointData)\r\n  - rdd.count (if eager = true)\r\n    - SparkContext.runJob for all the partitions\r\n      - DAGScheduler.runJob\r\n      - rdd.doCheckpoint\r\n        - ReliableCheckpointRDD#writeRDDToCheckpointDirectory\r\n          - SparkContext.runJob for all the partitions\r\n          - DAGScheduler.runJob (<-- This is the repeat job)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe local checkpointing case is better because there it will just\r\nrecompute the missing partitions.\r\n\r\nWe tried a fix where we just replaced `rdd.count` above with\r\n`rdd.doCheckpoint` and it seemed to work and pass the unit tests.\r\n\r\nSo the new flow is simply:\r\n```\r\n- df.checkpoint(eager = true, reliable = true)\r\n  - rdd = get rdd from this df's physical plan\r\n  - rdd.checkpoint (just marks checkpointData)\r\n  - rdd.doCheckpoint (if eager = true)\r\n    - ReliableCheckpointRDD#writeRDDToCheckpointDirectory\r\n      - SparkContext.runJob for all the partitions\r\n      - DAGScheduler.runJob (<-- Only one job is run)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis simple fix drastically improves spark jobs that make heavy use of\r\nDataframe.checkpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it would make eager checkpointing jobs supposedly faster by doing half as many spark jobs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCustomer spark apps using checkpoint with this fix see half as many\r\nspark jobs launched, seeing upto 50% less runtime in some cases.\r\nAlso, added one more unit test to check that only job is created.\r\n\r\nThis patch may have some interactions with the Spark-Streaming, since it\r\ntouches the codepaths enabled via the config\r\nspark.checkpoint.checkpointAllMarkedAncestors, so would be happy to add\r\nmore testing there if pointed in the right direction.","created_at":"2021-12-23T20:36:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T07:58:28Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T07:58:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba25c84828098958ecd7d7fd6e2a81e7b8b58533","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c936203995c70d040a16d54a8577494d810de483","head":{"label":"agrawaldevesh:master","ref":"master","sha":"c936203995c70d040a16d54a8577494d810de483","user":{"login":"agrawaldevesh","id":20564223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20564223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh","html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277609140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzc2MDkxNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"agrawaldevesh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"agrawaldevesh","id":20564223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20564223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh","html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday, the function lookup code path is pretty hard to understand as it spreads over many places:\r\n1. lookup v1 function\r\n2. lookup v2 function\r\n3. lookup higher-order function\r\n4. lookup table function\r\n5. lookup functions in different levels: builtin, temp and persistent.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a major refactor of the function lookup code path and cleans it up quite a bit. In general, it follows the idea of table lookup:\r\n1. Analyzer looks up built-in or temp functions first.\r\n2. Analyzer qualifies the function name with current catalog and namespace, or with view catalog/namespace if we are resolving a view.\r\n3. Analyzer calls v1 sessin catalog if the catalog is `spark_catalog`, otherwise call the v2 catalog.\r\n\r\nWith this refactor, the analyzer is kind of the router and the v1 session catalog can just have some small functions with very specific goals.\r\n\r\nThe function DDL commands also follow similar table/view commands and can fail automatically if the command requires persistent functions but the resolved function is built-in/temp. After this change, it should be simpler to add v2 function DDL commands.\r\n\r\nNote that, table function lookup is still in its own rule as it has a dedicated function registry and doesn't share the namespace of the scalar functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup to improve readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Since Spark 3.3, DESCRIBE FUNCTION fails if the function does not exist. In Spark 3.2 or earlier, DESCRIBE FUNCTION can still run and print \"Function: func_name not found\".\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen an OrcColumnarBatchReader is created, method initBatch will be called only once. In method initBatch:\r\n\r\n`orcVectorWrappers[i] = OrcColumnVectorUtils.toOrcColumnVector(dt, wrap.batch().cols[colId]);`\r\n\r\nWhen the second argument of toOrcColumnVector is a ListColumnVector/MapColumnVector, orcVectorWrappers[i] is initialized with the ListColumnVector or MapColumnVector's offsets and lengths. \r\n\r\nHowever, when method nextBatch of OrcColumnarBatchReader is called, method ensureSize of ColumnVector (and its subclasses, like MultiValuedColumnVector) could be called, then the ListColumnVector/MapColumnVector's offsets and lengths could refer to new array objects. This could result in the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes OrcArrayColumnVector.getArray and OrcMapColumnVector.getMap always get offsets and lengths from the underlying ColumnVector, which can resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBugfix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to show ignored configurations and hide the warnings for configurations that are already set when invoking `SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()` is too noisy even when duplicate configurations are set. Users cannot easily tell which configurations are to fix. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.abc=abc\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"DEBUG\")\r\nSparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.abc\", \"abc\").getOrCreate\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n21:04:01.670 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is straitforward when there are few configurations but it is difficult for users to figure out when there are too many configurations especially when these configurations are defined in a property file like 'spark-default.conf' maintained separately by system admins in production.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34757#discussion_r769248275.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n1. Show ignored configurations in debug level logs:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.abc=abc\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```scala\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"DEBUG\")\r\n    SparkSession.builder\r\n      .config(\"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\", \"2\")\r\n      .config(\"spark.abc\", \"abcb\")\r\n      .config(\"spark.abcd\", \"abcb4\")\r\n      .getOrCreate\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **Before:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    21:13:28.360 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; the static sql configurations will not take effect.\r\n    21:13:28.360 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **After**:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    20:34:30.619 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing Spark session; only runtime SQL configurations will take effect.\r\n    20:34:30.622 [main] DEBUG org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Ignored static SQL configurations:\r\n      spark.sql.warehouse.dir=2\r\n    20:34:30.623 [main] DEBUG org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Configurations that might not take effect:\r\n      spark.abcd=abcb4\r\n      spark.abc=abcb\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Do not issue a warning and hide a configuration already explicitly set (with the same value) before.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.abc=abc\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```scala\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"DEBUG\")\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.abc\", \"abc\").getOrCreate  // **Ignore** warnings because it's already set in --conf\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.abc.new\", \"abc\").getOrCreate  // **Show** warnings for only configuration newly set.\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.abc.new\", \"abc\").getOrCreate  // **Ignore** warnings because it's set ^.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **Before**:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    21:13:56.183 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    21:13:56.356 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    21:13:56.476 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n    **After:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    20:36:36.251 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing Spark session; only runtime SQL configurations will take effect.\r\n    20:36:36.253 [main] DEBUG org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Configurations that might not take effect:\r\n      spark.abc.new=abc\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Do not issue a warning and hide runtime SQL configurations in debug log:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./bin/spark-shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```scala\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"DEBUG\")\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", \"true\").getOrCreate  // **Ignore** warnings for runtime SQL configurations\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.buffer.size\", \"1234\").getOrCreate  // **Show** warnings for Spark core configuration\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.sql.source.specific\", \"abc\").getOrCreate  // **Show** warnings for custom runtime options\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\", \"xyz\").getOrCreate  // **Show** warnings for static SQL configurations\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **Before**:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    11:11:40.846 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    11:11:41.037 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    11:11:41.167 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; some spark core configurations may not take effect.\r\n    11:11:41.318 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing SparkSession; the static sql configurations will not take effect.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **After**:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    10:39:54.870 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing Spark session; only runtime SQL configurations will take effect.\r\n    10:39:54.872 [main] DEBUG org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Configurations that might not take effect:\r\n      spark.buffer.size=1234\r\n    10:39:54.988 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing Spark session; only runtime SQL configurations will take effect.\r\n    10:39:54.988 [main] DEBUG org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Configurations that might not take effect:\r\n      spark.sql.source.specific=abc\r\n    10:39:55.107 [main] WARN  org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Using an existing Spark session; only runtime SQL configurations will take effect.\r\n    10:39:55.108 [main] DEBUG org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession - Ignored static SQL configurations:\r\n      spark.sql.warehouse.dir=xyz\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nNote that there is no behaviour change on session state initialization when configurations are not set. For example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"DEBUG\")\r\nSparkSession.builder.getOrCreate\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the session state initialization can be triggered now for static SQL configurations set after this PR. Previously, it was not triggered. This would not introduce something user-facing or a bug but worth noting it.\r\nFor runtime SQL configurations, the session state initialization in this code path was introduced at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15295.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was manually tested as shown above.","created_at":"2021-12-23T12:39:29Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:51:43Z","closed_at":"2021-12-24T03:51:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0835618851b3bec68a3fd2dc6c2f6ada88cf5ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae4616c9ad1429d79130a1008807d98b809d64e2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-37727","ref":"SPARK-37727","sha":"ae4616c9ad1429d79130a1008807d98b809d64e2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSort merge join allows buffered side to spill if the size is too large to hold in memory. It would be good to add a \"spill size\" SQL metrics in sort merge join, to track how often the spill happens, and how much of spill size would be in case when it spills.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis helps to get more insights from query when the spill happens. Also help us decide whether to use Spark code-gen engine vs customized columnar engine, in case customized engine not support spill for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes the SQL metrics \"spill size\" itself on Spark UI.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n* Modified existing unit test in `SQLMetricsSuite.scala`.\r\n* Tested simple query with `spark-shell`

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisable ANSI reserved keywords by default in ANSI mode\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe reserved keywords thing is a big stopper for many users that want to try ANSI mode. They have to update the SQL queries to pass the parser, which is nothing about data quality but just trouble. Also, there could some existing table names conflict with the ANSI reserved keyword, e.g. `USER`.\r\n\r\nBy disabling the feature as default, I think we can get better adoption of the ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, disable ANSI reserved keywords by default in ANSI mode\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR escapes `.` character in partition names as certain file systems (for example, ABFS) may not support it.\r\n\r\nI simply added the `.` character to the list of special characters in `ExternalCatalogUtils`. The class already covers backward compatibility so it would read the existing unescaped values with dots correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes an issue when ABFS throws `Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ABFS does not allow files or directories to end with a dot.` exception if a partition name contains `.` symbol.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nForward compatibility is fine, Spark will be able to read both escaped and unescaped `.` characters.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no changes in reading string values, there are the following backward incompatible changes:\r\n- Double values will not be inferred correctly, this would require backports to older Spark versions.\r\n- There is a user-facing change when displaying any double values or string values containing a dot. For example, the command `SHOW PARTITIONS` would return slightly different result as well as directory names:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nSHOW PARTITIONS escapeDots;\r\n\r\n+----------+\r\n| partition|\r\n+----------+\r\n|value=%2E.|\r\n|   value=.|\r\n|  value=a.|\r\n|value=b.c.|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nSHOW PARTITIONS escapeDots;\r\n\r\n+--------------+\r\n|     partition|\r\n+--------------+\r\n|value=%252E%2E|\r\n|     value=%2E|\r\n|    value=a%2E|\r\n|value=b%2Ec%2E|\r\n+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn order to enable the UTs in `mllib-local` and `mllib` to use `mockito` to mock `j.u.Random`, `-add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.util.random=ALL-UNNAMED` compile option is added for Java 17  in SPARK-37070 . \r\n\r\nThis pr do the following change to remove the `-add-exports` option:\r\n1. Introduce test dependence of mockito-inline, the new test dependence used to specify the configuration of `mockito-extensions`\r\n2. Upgrade org.scalatestplus:mockito from 3-4 to 3-12 and upgrade mockito from 3.4.x to 3.12.x\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFind a way to let `mockito` can mock `j.u.Random` directly and remove `-add-exports` compile option for Java 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Manual test with Java 17.0.1\r\n\r\nUse maven\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -pl mllib-local -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn test -pl mllib-local \r\n\r\nmvn clean install -pl mllib -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn test -pl mllib\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse sbt\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt mllib-local/test\r\nbuild/sbt mllib/test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are no test failed related to ` org.mockito.exceptions.base.MockitoException: Mockito cannot mock this class: class java.util.Random.` without `-add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.util.random=ALL-UNNAMED`, all test can be successful.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-23T03:33:13Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:43:54Z","closed_at":"2021-12-31T01:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d0eda9d4742ec8f7d2abbcce0e84a2a28645a62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0618b0cb09765ba0ae91972b91bc960756dc8b49","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:upgrade-mockito","ref":"upgrade-mockito","sha":"0618b0cb09765ba0ae91972b91bc960756dc8b49","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

branch-3.2 version!\r\nFor master version see : https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34745\r\n\r\nAugments the JdbcConnectionProvider API such that a provider can indicate that it will need to modify the global security configuration when establishing a connection, and as such, if access to the global security configuration should be synchronized to prevent races.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs suggested by @gaborgsomogyi [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29024/files#r755788709), augments the `JdbcConnectionProvider` API to include a `modifiesSecurityContext` method that can be used by `ConnectionProvider` to determine when `SecurityConfigurationLock.synchronized` is required to avoid race conditions when establishing a JDBC connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvides a path forward for working around a significant bottleneck introduced by synchronizing `SecurityConfigurationLock` every time a connection is established. The synchronization isn't always needed and it should be at the discretion of the `JdbcConnectionProvider` to determine when locking is necessary. See [SPARK-37391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37391) or [this thread](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29024/files#r754441783).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAny existing implementations of `JdbcConnectionProvider` will need to add a definition of `modifiesSecurityContext`. I'm also open to adding a default implementation, but it seemed to me that requiring an explicit implementation of the method was preferable.\r\n\r\nA drop-in implementation that would continue the existing behavior is:\r\n```scala\r\noverride def modifiesSecurityContext(\r\n  driver: Driver,\r\n  options: Map[String, String]\r\n): Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests. Also ran a real workflow by swapping in a locally published version of `spark-sql` into my local spark 3.2.0 installation's jars.","created_at":"2021-12-22T20:29:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-24T01:47:42Z","closed_at":"2021-12-24T01:47:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df04d5dcef59fee91e7a7c5068a47dbfdda29d42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1496047285,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDk2MDQ3Mjg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/EXAMPLES","name":"EXAMPLES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/359dbe6071b67ef53d58ca300e15bb9d1ed35bee","head":{"label":"tdg5:SPARK-37391-opt-in-security-configuration-sync-branch-3.2","ref":"SPARK-37391-opt-in-security-configuration-sync-branch-3.2","sha":"359dbe6071b67ef53d58ca300e15bb9d1ed35bee","user":{"login":"tdg5","id":2316989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5","html_url":"https://github.com/tdg5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433077773,"node_id":"R_kgDOGdA-DQ","name":"spark","full_name":"tdg5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdg5","id":2316989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5","html_url":"https://github.com/tdg5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdg5/spark","description":"Apache

branch-3.1 version!\r\nFor master version see : https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34745\r\n\r\nAugments the JdbcConnectionProvider API such that a provider can indicate that it will need to modify the global security configuration when establishing a connection, and as such, if access to the global security configuration should be synchronized to prevent races.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs suggested by @gaborgsomogyi [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29024/files#r755788709), augments the `JdbcConnectionProvider` API to include a `modifiesSecurityContext` method that can be used by `ConnectionProvider` to determine when `SecurityConfigurationLock.synchronized` is required to avoid race conditions when establishing a JDBC connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvides a path forward for working around a significant bottleneck introduced by synchronizing `SecurityConfigurationLock` every time a connection is established. The synchronization isn't always needed and it should be at the discretion of the `JdbcConnectionProvider` to determine when locking is necessary. See [SPARK-37391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37391) or [this thread](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29024/files#r754441783).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAny existing implementations of `JdbcConnectionProvider` will need to add a definition of `modifiesSecurityContext`. I'm also open to adding a default implementation, but it seemed to me that requiring an explicit implementation of the method was preferable.\r\n\r\nA drop-in implementation that would continue the existing behavior is:\r\n```scala\r\noverride def modifiesSecurityContext(\r\n  driver: Driver,\r\n  options: Map[String, String]\r\n): Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests. Also ran a real workflow by swapping in a locally published version of `spark-sql` into my local spark 3.1.2 installation's jars.","created_at":"2021-12-22T19:56:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-24T01:48:31Z","closed_at":"2021-12-24T01:48:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d938e55629586905e4260f2944763b55977eaa5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ddac4bc08e83341ff143813c5efbdbcfb73160c","head":{"label":"tdg5:SPARK-37391-opt-in-security-configuration-sync-branch-3.1","ref":"SPARK-37391-opt-in-security-configuration-sync-branch-3.1","sha":"8ddac4bc08e83341ff143813c5efbdbcfb73160c","user":{"login":"tdg5","id":2316989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5","html_url":"https://github.com/tdg5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433077773,"node_id":"R_kgDOGdA-DQ","name":"spark","full_name":"tdg5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdg5","id":2316989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5","html_url":"https://github.com/tdg5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdg5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdg5/spark","description":"Apache

It also improves the error messages when a lateral join contains non-deterministic expressions that are not currently supported.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-37199 changes PlanExpression's `deterministic` field definition: both the children and the plan itself have to be deterministic for the plan expression to be deterministic. So users can no longer use lateral join with non-deterministic lateral subqueries. This PR is to improve the error messages and allows a special case when the outer query only produces at most one row.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Improve error messages:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: nondeterministic expressions are only allowed in\r\nProject, Filter, Aggregate or Window\r\n```\r\nAfter\r\n```\r\nNon-deterministic lateral subqueries are not supported when joining with outer relations that produce more than one row\r\n-- Or\r\nLateral join condition cannot be non-deterministic:\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nSQL query tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-22T18:46:17Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T09:04:31Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T09:04:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4768e821e42219df893ff6c0c81352e1d1cbde0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34987/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34987/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34987/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4822a61afcdc0a40cf243d80b1f9b7521dc7cf46","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-37716-lateral-join","ref":"spark-37716-lateral-join","sha":"4822a61afcdc0a40cf243d80b1f9b7521dc7cf46","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Allow casting between numeric type and timestamp type under ANSI mode \r\n* Remove the user-facing configuration `spark.sql.ansi.allowCastBetweenDatetimeAndNumeric`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSame reason as mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34459. It is for better adoption of ANSI SQL mode since users are relying on it:\r\n- As we did some data science, we found that many Spark SQL users are actually using `Cast(Timestamp as Numeric)` and `Cast(Numeric as Timestamp)`. \r\n- The Spark SQL connector for Tableau is using this feature for DateTime math. e.g.\r\n `CAST(FROM_UNIXTIME(CAST(CAST(%1 AS BIGINT) + (%2 * 86400) AS BIGINT)) AS TIMESTAMP)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, casting between numeric type and timestamp type is allowed by default under ANSI SQL mode \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\nHere is the screenshot of the document

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSince Spark 3.X, Executor pod needs separate executor configmap. But, no namespace is assigned in configmap while building it. K8s views configmap without namespace as global resource. Once pod access is restricted (global resources cannot be read), and executor cannot obtain configmap itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix executor pod authorization error in K8S. When executor pod cannot read global resources, executor configmap is not available for executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass Integration Test and CIs.","created_at":"2021-12-22T09:16:43Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T06:16:50Z","closed_at":"2021-12-31T02:29:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b082acf94f12ea8aae9c5f8d149ce44441264dfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/730a61cb7f38722b16d480fc81624dcf5fb9f429","head":{"label":"dcoliversun:SPARK-37713","ref":"SPARK-37713","sha":"730a61cb7f38722b16d480fc81624dcf5fb9f429","user":{"login":"dcoliversun","id":44011673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDExNjcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44011673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun","html_url":"https://github.com/dcoliversun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":427809934,"node_id":"R_kgDOGX_cjg","name":"spark","full_name":"dcoliversun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dcoliversun","id":44011673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDExNjcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44011673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun","html_url":"https://github.com/dcoliversun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dcoliversun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32816 , we moved the rule `OptimizeSkewedJoin` from `queryStageOptimizerRules` to `queryStagePreparationRules`. This means that the input plan of `OptimizeSkewedJoin` will be the entire query plan, while before the input plan was a shuffle stage which is usually a small part of the query plan.\r\n\r\nHowever, to simplify the implementation, `OptimizeSkewedJoin` has a check that it will be skipped if the input plan has more than 2 shuffle stages. This is obviously problematic now, as the input plan is the entire query plan and is very likely to have more than 2 shuffles.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the check from `OptimizeSkewedJoin` completely, as it's no longer needed.\r\n1. We can and should optimize all the skewed joins in the query plan.\r\n2. If it introduces extra shuffles, we can return the original input plan, or accept it if the force-apply config is true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a performance regression in the master branch (not released yet)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new metadata key `org.apache.spark.timeZone` which Spark writes to Parquet/Avro matadata while performing of datetimes rebase in the `LEGACY` mode (see the SQL configs:\r\n- `spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite`,\r\n- `spark.sql.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` and\r\n- `spark.sql.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite`).\r\n\r\nThe writers uses the current session time zone (see the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`) in rebasing of Parquet/Avro timestamp columns.\r\n\r\nAt the reader side, Spark tries to get info about the writer's time zone from the new metadata property:\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar ~parquet-tools-1.12.0.jar meta ./part-00000-b0d90bf0-ce60-4b4f-b453-b33f61ab2b2a-c000.snappy.parquet\r\n...\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.timeZone = America/Los_Angeles\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.legacyDateTime =\r\n```\r\nand use it in rebasing timestamps to the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. In the case when the reader cannot retrieve the original time zone from Parquet/Avro metadata, it uses the default JVM time zone for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore the changes, Spark assumes that a writer uses the default JVM time zone while rebasing of dates/timestamps. And if a reader and the writer have different JVM time zone settings, the reader cannot load such columns in the `LEGACY` mode correctly. So, the reader will have full info about writer settings after the changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, Parquet/Avro writers use the session time zone while timestamp rebasing in the `LEGACY` mode instead of the default JVM time zone. Need to highlight that the session time zone is set to the JVM time zone by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n```\r\n2. And related existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *RebaseDateTimeSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *TimestampFormatterSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"avro/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.avro.AvroCatalystDataConversionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroRowReaderSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroSerdeSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetVectorizedSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Also modified the test `SPARK-31159: rebasing timestamps in write` to check loading timestamps in the LEGACY mode when the session time zone and JVM time zone are different.\r\n\r\n4. Generated parquet files by Spark 3.2.0 (the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5d45a415f3a29898d92380380cfd82bfc7f579ea) using the test `\"SPARK-31806: generate test files for checking compatibility with Spark 2.4\"`.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/c07a50b86254578625be777b1890ff95e832ac6e the duration of a stage on UI does not display as stage `completion time - submission time`, the `completion time - 1st task launch time`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we fix the tips to prevent misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nthe description of Stage Duration confuses me for a long time as it is not consistent with the job duration if the job has one stage only.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, UI changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPassing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`ExecutorMonitor` should ignore `SparkListenerBlockUpdated` event if executor was not active\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf not ignored, `ExecutorMonitor` will create a new executor tracker with UNKNOWN_RESOURCE_PROFILE_ID for the dead executor. And `ExecutorAllocationManager` will not remove executor with UNKNOWN_RESOURCE_PROFILE_ID, which cause a executor slot is occupied by the dead executor, so a new one cannot be created.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new test.","created_at":"2021-12-20T07:48:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T03:43:48Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T03:42:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f7659d783909a754e274dd4b5f0510d758de1c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/289717ad8b5c86c9812d491845c47919b627dc7c","head":{"label":"sleep1661:SPARK-37688","ref":"SPARK-37688","sha":"289717ad8b5c86c9812d491845c47919b627dc7c","user":{"login":"sleep1661","id":8802096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDIwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8802096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661","html_url":"https://github.com/sleep1661","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"34fb801ce05636366af0cec431e3aba1d3430c14","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdjust the grouping rules of `distinctAggGroups`, specifically in `RewriteDistinctAggregates.groupDistinctAggExpr`, so that some 'distinct' can be grouped together, and conditions(eg. CaseWhen, If) involved in them will be stored in the 'if_vector' to avoid unnecessary expanding. The 'if_vector' and 'filter_vector' introduced here can reduce the number of columns in the expand. Besides, children in distinct aggregate function with same datatype will share same project column.\r\nHere is a example comparing the difference between the original expand rewriting and the new with 'merged column' and 'bit vector' (in sql):\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  COUNT(DISTINCT cat1) FILTER (WHERE id > 1) as cat1_filter_cnt_dist,\r\n  COUNT(DISTINCT cat2) FILTER (WHERE id > 2) as cat2_filter_cnt_dist,\r\n  COUNT(DISTINCT IF(value > 5, cat1, null)) as cat1_if_cnt_dist,\r\n  COUNT(DISTINCT id) as id_cnt_dist,\r\n  SUM(DISTINCT value) as id_sum_dist\r\nFROM data\r\nGROUP BY key\r\n```\r\nCurrent rule will rewrite the above sql plan to the following (pseudo) logical plan:\r\n```\r\nAggregate(\r\n   key = ['key]\r\n   functions = [\r\n       count('cat1) FILTER (WHERE (('gid = 1) AND 'max(id > 1))),\r\n       count('(IF((value > 5), cat1, null))) FILTER (WHERE ('gid = 5)),\r\n       count('cat2) FILTER (WHERE (('gid = 3) AND 'max(id > 2))),\r\n       count('id) FILTER (WHERE ('gid = 2)),\r\n       sum('value) FILTER (WHERE ('gid = 4))\r\n   ]\r\n   output = ['key, 'cat1_filter_cnt_dist, 'cat2_filter_cnt_dist, 'cat1_if_cnt_dist,\r\n             'id_cnt_dist, 'id_sum_dist])\r\n  Aggregate(\r\n     key = ['key, 'cat1, 'value, 'cat2, '(IF((value > 5), cat1, null)), 'id, 'gid]\r\n     functions = [max('id > 1), max('id > 2)]\r\n     output = ['key, 'cat1, 'value, 'cat2, '(IF((value > 5), cat1, null)), 'id, 'gid,\r\n               'max(id > 1), 'max(id > 2)])\r\n    Expand(\r\n       projections = [\r\n         ('key, 'cat1, null, null, null, null, 1, ('id > 1), null),\r\n         ('key, null, null, null, null, 'id, 2, null, null),\r\n         ('key, null, null, 'cat2, null, null, 3, null, ('id > 2)),\r\n         ('key, null, 'value, null, null, null, 4, null, null),\r\n         ('key, null, null, null, if (('value > 5)) 'cat1 else null, null, 5, null, null)\r\n       ]\r\n       output = ['key, 'cat1, 'value, 'cat2, '(IF((value > 5), cat1, null)), 'id,\r\n                 'gid, '(id > 1), '(id > 2)])\r\n      LocalTableScan [...]\r\n```\r\nAfter applying 'merged column' and 'bit vector' tricks, the logical plan will become:\r\n```\r\nAggregate(\r\n   key = ['key]\r\n   functions = [\r\n       count('merged_string_1) FILTER (WHERE (('gid = 1) AND NOT (('filter_vector_1 & 1) = 0))),\r\n       count(if (NOT (('if_vector_1 & 1) = 0)) 'merged_string_1 else null) FILTER (WHERE ('gid = 1)),\r\n       count('merged_string_1) FILTER (WHERE (('gid = 2) AND NOT (('filter_vector_1 & 1) = 0))),\r\n       count('merged_integer_1) FILTER (WHERE ('gid = 3)),\r\n       sum('merged_integer_1) FILTER (WHERE ('gid = 4))\r\n   ]\r\n   output = ['key, 'cat1_filter_cnt_dist, 'cat2_filter_cnt_dist, 'cat1_if_cnt_dist,\r\n             'id_cnt_dist, 'id_sum_dist])\r\n  Aggregate(\r\n     key = ['key, 'merged_string_1, 'merged_integer_1, 'gid]\r\n     functions = [bit_or('if_vector_1),bit_or('filter_vector_1)]\r\n     output = ['key, 'merged_string_1, 'merged_integer_1, 'gid, 'bit_or(if_vector_1), 'bit_or(filter_vector_1)])\r\n    Expand(\r\n       projections = [\r\n         ('key, 'cat1, null, 1, if ('value > 5) 1 else 0, if ('id > 1) 1 else 0),\r\n         ('key, 'cat2, null, 2, null, if ('id > 2) 1 else 0),\r\n         ('key, null, 'id, 3, null, null),\r\n         ('key, null, 'value, 4, null, null)\r\n       ]\r\n       output = ['key, 'merged_string_1, 'merged_integer_1, 'gid, 'if_vector_1, 'filter_vector_1])\r\n      LocalTableScan [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt can save mass memory and improve performance in some cases like:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \r\n  count(distinct case when cond1 then col1 end),\r\n  count(distinct case when cond2 then col1 end),\r\n  ...\r\nFROM data\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test and a new UT in DataFrameAggregateSuite to test 'Vector Size larger than 64'.\r\nI have written some SQL locally to test the correctness of the distinct calculation, but it seems difficult to cover most of the cases. Perhaps spark's existing test set will be more comprehensive, so I didn't leave it in the code.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-20T04:00:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T00:16:25Z","closed_at":"2022-04-04T00:16:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61153aa9b642e9f3e65986aa875e9aff72f1aceb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/edad706d9b7cb5fa32ef80d39c1cc11f3fda68c7","head":{"label":"Flyangz:improve-RewriteDistinctAggregates","ref":"improve-RewriteDistinctAggregates","sha":"edad706d9b7cb5fa32ef80d39c1cc11f3fda68c7","user":{"login":"Flyangz","id":39462475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDYyNDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39462475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz","html_url":"https://github.com/Flyangz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433708384,"node_id":"R_kgDOGdndYA","name":"spark","full_name":"Flyangz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Flyangz","id":39462475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDYyNDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39462475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz","html_url":"https://github.com/Flyangz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flyangz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Flyangz/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to make log event immutable in `LogAppender`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI noticed that rarely a few tests which use `LogAppender` to check log events fail with NPE. I repeatedly ran a single test locally and found that the event could be changed. Seems Log4j2 will reuse log event: https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/blob/4b789c8572d1762cd55f051971d91e44f0628908/log4j-api/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/ReusableMessage.java#L22-L27.\r\n\r\nIn Spark test, we have used `LogAppender` which records log events and check them later. So sometimes the event will be changed and cause test failure. To stabilize Spark tests, we should make the event immutable when recording it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. Test only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass
